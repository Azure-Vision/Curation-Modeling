LifeProTips,removed,this is a common sense lpt
LifeProTips,removed,wow i have one just like thatif someone doesnt want to have sex with you just hold a knife to their throats and wait until they stop crying until you penetrate them
LifeProTips,removed,as far as you not being op dont care youre defending that position pretty strongly second the fact that you see it as being backed into a corner means you were pushing for an argument to begin with in other words you werent trying to have an adult conversation you were trying to provoke an argument i dont have time for that fuck off and die perhaps you should consider what kind of response youre going for before you post something as aggressive as your original reply be honest here buddy you werent being polite you were trying to poke and you intentionally narrowed your argument to try and make it look like i was wrong when in fact my caution was much broader than cpr yeah so i have some strong personal feelings about this because my aunt got sued how about this next time you see a wreck on the road stop and help them out then when they ask you for your name and address ask yourself how you feel about that oh yeah fuck off and maybe try to be more of an openminded adult next time instead of trying to provoke an argument because thats what youll get think genius
LifeProTips,removed,by the way im reporting you to the admins and asking them to ban you for intentionally provoking an argument theres no way youre that stupid that you thought your response would result in a civil conversation your responses have been ignorant and then youre surprised when i attack you for being stupid grow up you child you wanted an argument dont try to pretend you didnt mr tough guy
LifeProTips,removed,wait a second here youre a medic now i know why youre so ignorant i used to work in a medevac company in the army yep medics are onedimensional this is good dont bother me with facts fuck off guy you dont even have the ability to think youre emotion just like every other medic ive ever met why dont you stick to the ambulance where you belong and leave the advice to someone who isnt emotional
LifeProTips,removed,fuck off youre a onedimensional medic which is why you were incapable of understanding that this discussion was supposed to be broader than cpr in the first place next time announce youre a medic so people know to break things down into bitesize pieces for you so it doesnt turn into an argument now go do some important medic stuff and then go brag about how you save lives to someone who cares make sure you dont forget your little red cross lapel pin or whatever oh and dont start arguments unless youre willing to listen next time
LifeProTips,removed,is your name michelle and are you from nebraska if not then i really dont care about you
LifeProTips,removed,ladies dont start arguments they listen carefully and seek to understand what the other person is saying instead of dousing them with gas and tossing a match at them

LifeProTips,removed,interviews getting hired is about people being critical of you interviews and getting hired are about dryhumping a job candidate until they submit to the accusation they arent quite ivy league enough that approach gives us twitter which is a billion company that consists of a web site and literally nothing else and has never turned a profit i do think a great deal of people blame everything around them for a lack of success you know dick all about my success when they themselves and their attitude are the real reason it never ceases to amaze me hiring managers expect someone with a iq and a career full of success to come through the door and not have an attitude its so childish and incompetent then again those are the kind of people who can take billion and ram it into the shitter

LifeProTips,removed,just a side note if youre a witness to an incident but really have nothing to add that no one else present couldnt give an honest account of do not file a police report you will put yourself on record and the opposing party will drag you into it when they decide to bring suit if no one knows wtf you are and you were in no way involved in the confrontation best keep it that way im sure this isnt the best of advice in all cases but its a damn good way to risk your name getting dragged through the mud

LifeProTips,removed,uhhh what age has nothing to do with it depending on what you do ive worked in different tech companies and have hired maybe devs over the years and interviewed probably as someone who has been on the other side of the table for a lot of interviews this is good advice if you can back it up theyll back it up in the technical interviews and if its not a dev interview theyll back it up during the portion where theyre being quizzed on industry knowledge interviews are usually a chitchat portion to see their cultural fit quiztype portion for their knowledge theyre separate i highly doubt op is talking about the technical portion because well it would make sense as much bs as there is in interviews we still usually have a very good idea if a candidate is highly qualified for the role or not if youre interviewing them you obviously saw their resume and have a pretty good idea of what they have experience with how does what you think of the candidate apply to the lpt at all so have some selfawareness and if you actually are in a position of strength then its to your advantage to act like it but if you try this when you arent a very strong candidate were going to be rolling our eyes if you dont know your shit well figure it out groundbreaking this lpt is obviously aimed towards people who are half competent but simply suck at interviews note as a rule if youre under you should pretty much never be trying this if youre an exception to this rule youll know it i appreciate young eager employees but of them havent proven anything yet show me that youre a quick learner and have strong dedication to tasks instead give examples bullshit if you work for a half decent company youll have to be fighting for those year old college kids you bring in because theyre all fucking smart i have interviewed a bunch of kids from mit caltech etc at the end of the day they all know their shit what sets them apart showing me theyre aware of what they want and what itll take us to get them and of course some personality the lpt of interviewing them to see if theyre worth their time simply means ask good questions and i very much appreciate good questions from candidates because it shows me that theyll be able to jump right into the work because theyve already thought about it and have experience with it for example ive interviewed year old kids who asked how we dealt with dead nodes between elections within apacha khafka on our scala stack he obviously knew what technology we were using and was very well versed in it then weve had older candidates who didnt know jack shit age means nothing

LifeProTips,removed,if its a problem that happens often enough that you need to find a cure for it then the best approach is prevention eat as long as youre hungry stop eating as soon as youre no longer hungry if you keep eating past that point then its a waste of eating enjoyment you will feel bad not good

LifeProTips,removed,once i tried talking politics and the person turned out to be a raging sjw who just shouted the same thing over and over and called me a racist misogynist homophobe instead of discussing ideas once i tried talking politics but we couldnt agree on the implications of the facts once i tried talking politics and got in an argument with my grandmother during the holidays discussing politics irl is rarely useful
LifeProTips,removed,whoa look at all that liberal regurgitation
LifeProTips,removed,no you didnt not even close its far more common on the right not only that you dont get high ranking democrats making these arguments i said trump not most republicans i guess you cant read or reason since everything you have posted thus far is irrelevant or wrong read a book and educate yourself before posting
LifeProTips,removed,why i talk politics with my openly racist skin head trump supporting brother all the time we even insult each other sometimes we get mad but most times we dont and we will always love each other we always take the opportunity to talk about it with each other thought because both of us kind live in echo chambers so our conversations are the only times we get to hear why the other side thinks what it does from someone we actually want to understand
LifeProTips,removed,i know its hard to be confronted with facts and reality dont worry youre a trump supporter you must be an expert at denying reality
LifeProTips,removed,americucks are retarded no one follows them
LifeProTips,removed,wtf are you really talking about despite what you think you know about the us people here talk about politics all the fucking time yes its become particularly volatile this election cycle and many normal ass people have decided to keep their mouth shut but brother i work at a grocery store and i wish i could hear less about politics the real lpt should be about not berating and judging people based on their political views especially if they are not based on facts i know so many regular ass people who voted trump here in florida because they were too afraid of being called a racist bigot have any real discourse middle liners who didnt want to be judged by their leftist friends but didnt have to facts straight and no one knew or tried to change their minds until it was too late stop being a dick and take a moment to listen to the people you disagree with so that they will listen to you
LifeProTips,removed,nope
LifeProTips,removed,if the russians are so bad why did hillary do a reset with them
LifeProTips,removed,youll be embarrassed by these words in a few years once you graduate and get some real experience dealing with people who dont see you as a child or student and give you a pass automatically for being obnoxious and annoying
LifeProTips,removed,the second one has literally zero nuance unless you are a complete moron the third issue has literally zero nuance as well there is no reason to be convinced that russia did not hack us there is reason to think it was probably russia but acknowledge there exists some possibility that it wasnt them but thats not what most trump voters believe and certainly not people on the donald the last claim also has zero nuance no serious economist would make the argument that nafta is the worst trade deal in history you might find a few well educated and respected economists who say it was a slight negative

LifeProTips,removed,so my dad would actually get mad at me in high school for setting the parking brake in my parents automatics which i was taught in driver training but apparently my mom had forgotten to take the parking brake off while driving a few times which apparently is bad so my dad basically said i was to never put it on and that it was useless because of the parking gear on the transmission we do live on the prairie which isnt known for its abundant hills though
LifeProTips,removed,people do this
LifeProTips,removed,my understanding is in europe the vast majority of people drive cars with manual transmissions in those its a lot more obvious you need the parkinghandbrake in the us its far more common to have an automatic transmission in an automatic transmission theres a park gear and most cars wont let you remove keys from the ignition if the car isnt in that gear its not a brake it just puts the transmission in a configuration where if the car tries to roll the transmission doesnt turn since its connected to the drive shaft and thus the wheels that tends to stop the car from rolling my drivers education course didnt even mention the handbrake or if it did it was such a passing mention i dont remember it my dad had a manual transmission truck and always applied the parking brake in that but i dont know many people that apply it when they park in an automatic i only started recently after reading that not using it can put stress on the transmission other good lpt though treat cars like guns dont walk in front of them especially if you just parked them or if the engines running
LifeProTips,removed,lpt gfy i do what i want

LifeProTips,removed,the last uncontested assassination is from so youre saying the assassination of bin laden by the us is contested are you i dont think anyone would agree least of all the us government who claimed full credit as for whether theres evidence to support the rest id like to point you in the direction of the findings by the international court of justice in the case of nicaragua vs usa in the youcan read the courts conclusions here the icj found the us guilty of acting against the republic of nicaragua under customary international law not to violate the sovereignty of another state and of intervening in affairs and interrupting peaceful maritime commerce its essentially been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the us was responsible for the assassination of the nicaraguan politicians named on the list i linked you to but again youre just ignoring the facts saddam husseins sons were assassinated by the us and hussein himself was turned over to usloyal factions for trial and execution it might not have been the us government that committed the deed themselves but they undoubtedly knew they were sending him to his death i dont see that theres any practical moral difference the outcome is the same you interfered with their politics for your own benefit and you had no right to do so ill concede that hussein didnt get elected when he first took power and that the election that he did allow to be held during his reign was almost undoubtedly rigged but one way or another the point i was making was that youre more than willing to control the development of politics in countries that you have no right to be involved in you didnt oust saddam for the good of the iraqi people you did it because he was becoming powerful and wasnt playing by your rules so you needed to get him out of the way he was a threat to your ability to exploit the middle east for its oil so you ensured that he was removed so you said that it was justified for americans to fight if they are attacked but you wont concede that its therefore acceptable for people in the middle east to defend themselves against western aggression that makes you a hypocrite and a racist and do you not realise that the hatred that causes those people to take up arms against america is a direct response to the lives you took in the suppression of the palestinian people and subsequent conflicts in the area they werent attacking you until you started attacking them all they did was defend themselves yes i absolutely agree that you can show your political dissent by peaceful means but honestly if your country was invaded and your friends family neighbours etc were persecuted and killed in the streets for decades by another nation how long do you think youd sit at a keyboard for before you decided to fight back peaceful protest is only effective it its listened to america showed no evidence that they were interested in a peaceful resolution not only that but the people you invaded werent even the ones who attacked you individuals primarily from saudi arabia the united arab emirates lebanon and egypt hijacked planes and flew them into the world trade centre on these individuals werent representatives of the governments of these countries and america responded by invading iraq and afghanistan if your method of dissent is by trying to kill westerners but as ive pointed out most of the people youre attacking werent trying to kill westerners westerners were trying to kill them for no reason this is why groups like isis now exist because they saw the way and other isolated incidents were used as an excuse to launch fullscale military war on the arab world this is what i am referring to when i talk about destruction of culture its their religion and their way of life that got them invaded that and their resources that you wanted to control im talking about people like obl and isis who say on video that they want to kill people this coming from the guy who just said hes comfortable with the us government killing people who it disagrees with again hypocrisy and racism youre confusing politics with culture no im not since the two are inseperable politics is a part of culture and culture informs politics in fact in many ways politics is what drives the development of culture since it is political decisions that decide which elements of cultural development are accepted and which are made illegal or shut down your slavery argument falls apart when you consider the glut of goods the us gets from china who the us has basically exerted no control over dont be so fucking ridiculous all this suggests is that you havent enslaved the chinese which you wouldnt be able to do it you tried since you couldnt defeat the koreans or the vietnamese when you tried that and china is clearly a lot more powerful just because theres some countries you havent yet enslaved doesnt mean you havent tried to enslave others thats like saying well in the we used to trade with japan so we couldnt have been enslaving africans it makes no logical sense and is utter bullshit im done with this conversation you clearly havent thought about any of this for yourself and arent open to a sensible discussion so im wasting my time dont expect another reply

LifeProTips,removed,stating possible outcomes is not speculation speculation implies lack of evidence but actually there is a lot of evidence for what happens when you flip a coin ofc it is you will never be sure of anything because you dont have this superpower to gather all the data from a complex system such as life universe etc you can guess with a higher or lower margin of error but that doesnt make it a fact there will always be a lack of evidence the fact that you ignore that doesnt make it lesss true but once the thing happened well then its a fact its undeniable one year ago hillary clinton could have been the winner of the election and that would have been a factually true headline even if she might not be real or somebody could shoot her with a gun and kill her thats a prediction a prediction is a speculation the fact is that she is not president today a factually true headline a what d there is a probably an alternate reality where this is factually true but we know what happened in ours
LifeProTips,removed,on a more serious note it does seem like my lpt did not meet your expectations and has left you feeling upset and perhaps cheated i apologize if this is the case and encourage you to take it up with the moderators if you feel i am violating a community standard not that i owe you a defense but in my experience humans are mostly reactive idiots walking around babbling out the first thing that comes to their mind example you see a tall person and vomit out a statement like youre tall whoa how tall are you tally mctallersberg over here i think a very small portion aka the pros of social tact are aware enough to avoid knee jerk reactions like this so yeah dont bother a doctor off the clock make an appointment with them if you have a problem pay for their services unless youre dying dont ask your friend who works at the genius bar to fix your phone off the clock make an appointment with them they may not feel like fixing your shit for free or helping reset your apple id password dont demand your stand up comedian friend be hilarious at all times offstage if your argument is its common sense to avoid these things so dont post it as a pro tip try to imagine the long line of interactions it took me to deem this tip important

LifeProTips,removed,before i give any advice here keep in mind that it many not have anything to do with how you are phrasing it this may just be one of those hotbutton topics for her but lets say you arent phrasing it well here are some tips dont talk to her about it in the heat the moment eg when you are arguing about money when youve found a calm time to talk to her preface it by saying first of all we wouldnt even be having this talk if i didnt truly love you dont give her a big speech whatever you plan to say allow her to time to respond to each point or even just a part of a point nothing makes someone sound more condescending than a unbroken diatribe about what you think is wrong with them tie the love into the issue explain that because you love her and your relationship its hard for you to see her doing things that damage the relationship and push you away explain that you know you arent perfect when it comes to money either but that you guys need to find a way to compromise because the way things are going is making you severely unhappy be firm but undemanding i would tell her the core of the issue whatever it is you question whether you can have a future together it makes you unbearably anxious it is destroying your finances etc but offer to let her come up with some ideas for a compromise give her a turn in the drivers seat if she cant come up with something right away say youll return to the topic in a few days to give her time to come up with something if even after some time she cant see her way out offer your compromise if this is some sort of compulsion on her part however a compromise likely wont stick but if she is merely bad with money give her a few chances to screwup and see how things go

LifeProTips,removed,you live in a strange bubble

LifeProTips,removed,marie kondo is that you httptidyingupcom
LifeProTips,removed,conservatives call themselves conservative they wear the label just like a racist wears a white power logo
LifeProTips,removed,
LifeProTips,removed,even the reputable sites now have a political agenda cnn and nbc are heavily biased to the left fox is heavily biased to the right and those are just examples i dont know of any news outlet that isnt trying to grind a political agenda not one i just dont know if people have the time to run down ops checklist for every story they read
LifeProTips,removed,if it has make america grest againanywhere on the website its an altright fake news trashheap
LifeProTips,removed,tldr dont read news articles
LifeProTips,removed,so when the cia tells the president that weapons of mass destruction exist in iraq then the news media reports that as fact is that real or fake news
LifeProTips,removed,dont watch cnn and you will be alright
LifeProTips,removed,always remember how the news frames the story an example of three headlines two of them being fake news could be this the situation is hilary clinton is meeting with higher up bankers to talk about economic policy clinton meets with economic leaders to discuss policy crooked hilary schemes with wallstreet to help make policy clinton meets with leaders of bank firms to discuss economic policy the first two would be fake news neither are examples of actual lies but the first hides relevant information that could cause reasonable suspecion of the meeting hiding the fact that these economic leaders are wallstreet bankers and the second uses loaded language to make the reader have an automatically negative response to clinton her meeting and who she is meeting with without even giving full details of the story the final would be an example of a proper headline where it gives the important details of the story who is meeting who why are althey meeting without putting a positive or negative spin on the information just because nobody has blatantly lied in either title it doesnt mean they are being honest with how they present the information to you
LifeProTips,removed,avoid cnn and msnbc
LifeProTips,removed,i cant tell if this has an agenda are people genuinely this stupid or is this a form of concern trolling imply people can be so easily duped sidestep responsibility for hillary
LifeProTips,removed,just because a handful of unheard websites or less popularor even biased websites cover something doesnt mean something is real or fake news also just because it doesnt show up well on google results doesnt mean its fakes news google got caught manipulating search results several times during the election my point was more that just because other places dont cover or pick up the news story doesnt mean that its fake
LifeProTips,removed,hard to watch cable news when you dont even have cable but we get it you like infowars
LifeProTips,removed,unfortunately i have a lot of family members who would do good to read this post i remember during the election they were sharing obviously fake stories like hilary being involved in child sex trafficking and trump being endorsed by the pope and commenting on them like they were real stories lately i have been doing just this and double checking news stories that i see online even some stories that didnt seem obviously fake turned out to be when i looked into them further
LifeProTips,removed,should say listen to donald trump lol jk
LifeProTips,removed,is it cnn if it is not cnn you are viewing fake news turn off that source and turn on cnn rest assured that cnn will deliver the truth and do your thinking for you they are also the only news organization that is legally authorized to view wikileaks details you would go to jail if you tried to view them on their own but they have obtained a special permit to legally allow them to filter the content to you so please listen closely to their every word
LifeProTips,removed,what if the washington post claims they have an unverfied cia contact who claims donald trump is torturing babies in the white house is it factual because they said a cia agent said it i mean almost every fucking article on both sides right now is from an inside source from the cia either our intelligence agencies are leaking piles of shit or people are making shit up
LifeProTips,removed,so this comment would be considered biased since it only referenced fake news regarding trump got it thanks
LifeProTips,removed,we have trump to thank for bringing this entire concept of fake news to light
LifeProTips,removed,ap and reuters are good reputable sources hahahahahaahah the central news agncies that feed all the other unified fake news agencies hilarious ctr is getting desperate you lost the narrative its over
LifeProTips,removed,i know conservatives who honestly thought that colbert was a true conservative
LifeProTips,removed,anything thats stupid ridiculous outrageous or incredibly selfcentered can be attributed to donald trump as there is no doubt he must have said it at one point in his life
LifeProTips,removed,avoid everything but rthedonald
LifeProTips,removed,alt right guide protrump legit antitrump fake news
LifeProTips,removed,i didnt downvote you or call you poor and stupid im not sure who you are having an argument with because it isnt me keep fighting the good fight against those windmills i guess
LifeProTips,removed,did you see it on cnn fake news
LifeProTips,removed,perilous
LifeProTips,removed,that part on identity politics is a great point and is very relevant to whats going on now consider people like richard spencer who calls himself an httpsenwikipediaorgwikiidentitarianmovementinnorthamerica which is the altrights current favorite weasel word replacement for white supremacist groups like the people over at raltright in general have a very keen interest in their specific brand of identity politics specifically as it pertains to white supremacy if youre interested in keeping an eye out for this sort of thing learning the tactics that these people use to make and spread fake news is especially important
LifeProTips,removed,so when alex jones tells us that obama and clinton are literally demonsis that something that we take on faith or does he provide corroborating sources
LifeProTips,removed,i get my news from twittercomrealdonaldtrump
LifeProTips,removed,cnn provided clinton with actual debate questions prior to the debate no democratic strategist donna brazile provided clinton with the questions which prompted cnn to sever all ties with her
LifeProTips,removed,and no matter how the sandersclinton debates actually went had a panel of pundits ready to talk about how well clinton did how weak bernie looked and how presidential she looked after each debate
LifeProTips,removed,youve got a straw man with defending the lies here im not defending anyone in the least im fine with saying that hillary and trump both lied a hell of a lot in their campaigns theyre liars plain and simple they played lets continue the context of the election per se a very different game than the media they had different motivations funding reasons etc one might say that all politicians lie and it sounds like its excusing the ones that lie less than others believe me i am the opposite when people say that dems liecheatstealkill less than the gop i am quick to point out that both are wrong the media played the ratings game get the juiciest story out as fast as possible in order to secure ratings in whatever form this already is a bad proposition and follows a trend that started in earnest in the with sensationalist journalism it was very frowned upon well into the when it started becoming mainstream and is now the standard if you are one of the few that is more likely to click a bland headline rather than a bold one then congrats and well done most cannot resist the media is playing a losing game all the time theres little money to be made in reporting the news so they have to manufacture the story in doing so they are very likely to add bias and are much more likely to have an audience thats just as much our fault as theirs the real problem actually isnt the first two that can be attributed to the way the country and its economics work and the fact that all news is now privatized a doubleedged sword and forprofit or else as you say its indie and has a small unprofitable audience the real problem is that because of the money aspect all the major outlets are owned by a corporation who owns the editorial and dictates what any story cancannot say this is my point and it supersedes the rest i have worked in this paradigm myself for a corporation that had editorial control over my content i have had my work altered have had my content pulled and been told to avoid topics a great example is mike reiss an nfl reporter for espn a couple of years ago espn declared war on the new england patriots and created a heavy slant against them reiss a solid journalist and an offair fan of the patriots was forced to change his reporting to accommodate the new bias there were instances of him tweeting something that was later pulled or altered and him posting articles that were clearly against the team he liked his explanations for this were along the company lines but definitely hinted that he was heavily edited he remains at espn despite all that in the end he felt he didnt have a solid option for another job can we blame reiss as a liar is it his responsibility to only work for indie outlets that dont get read hed lose his access to the team and its players hed lose access to free travel road games and other events its a loselose scenario for us as consumers and i believe our only option is to be educated discerning and protest with our wallets where we can
LifeProTips,removed,i like the image you linked whered it come from i am surprised to see the gaurdian shown as being that balanced whenever i see articles from there they seem to have a big liberal bias to me
LifeProTips,removed,considering some of their coverage during the election im not sure how entirely neutral ap is anymore among other problems they called a few of the primaries before the polls had even closed
LifeProTips,removed,do we really need a how to differentiate fake news check list are we really that retarded
LifeProTips,removed,could you please source this properly the guy who tweeted this compiled like different tweets stating verbatim what you just posted
LifeProTips,removed,this fucking loser made a lpt just to shill a shitty video if youre drinking to get drunk youre costing yourself money drinking water is used to prevent hangovers and puking in the morning
LifeProTips,removed,i was going to think up a racist remark but then i realized that asians are the master race so ill hold my tongue
LifeProTips,removed,if you take the cash you have to buy another ticket as well and if you want to leave within the next couple of hours it will eat heavily into that profit
LifeProTips,removed,ummmwow racist
LifeProTips,removed,they didnt want to be friends with an asshole like you anyways
LifeProTips,removed,i am in fact talking about the benefit of the other person not myself i simply gave my personal opinion if i was in the shoes of the other person at the end sorry that confused you im not talking about myself im talking about how your advice would make it more likely for autistic people to be lonely forever and have no friends at all because people cant promise to dedicate all of their timetheir lives to the autistic person so they shouldnt try according to your logic
LifeProTips,removed,true
LifeProTips,removed,rlatestagecapitalism
LifeProTips,removed,maybe dont pretend to be someones friend in the first place casual conversations are a thing in the real world and acquaintances even autistic people are either capable of understanding that or have to find some other way of interacting with the world just blanket saying dont talk to them dont interact with them is really shitty advice for all parties involved
LifeProTips,removed,your pedantic comment definitely makes you an asshole
LifeProTips,removed,we need to build a wall to keep the gay out

LifeProTips,removed,here find a google sheets copy of my googllypmqw i use it to calculate intake caloric amount needed daily in order to maintain certain weight you all can comment just create a copy for yourselves for it to become usable about httpsenwikipediaorgwikibasalmetabolicrate basal metabolic rate bmr is the minimal rate of energy expenditure per unit time by endothermic animals at rest it is reported in energy units per unit time ranging from watt joulesecond to ml or joule per hour per kg body mass jh·kg proper measurement requires a strict set of criteria be met these criteria include being in a physically and psychologically undisturbed state in a thermally neutral environment while in the postabsorptive state ie not actively digesting food in bradymetabolic animals such as fish and reptiles the equivalent term standard metabolic rate smr is used it follows the same criteria as bmr but requires the documentation of the temperature at which the metabolic rate was measured this makes bmr a variant of standard metabolic rate measurement that excludes the temperature data a practice that has led to problems in defining standard rates of metabolism for many mammals

LifeProTips,removed,fuck off
LifeProTips,removed,im not sure if you think im a vet tech im not if i was id be fine with it as are most vet techs not that you care since based on your post history youre just looking for another person to get in a ridiculous internet argument with over basically nothing i guess thats your thing or one of them which says a lot about your own shitty life decisions but go on thinking youre just an awesome dude that happens to want to tell people off under the anonymity of reddit im sure you dont think youre a sad little shit but i have unfortunate news for you its pretty pathetic again though you wont be able to see it so i guess theres no point in posting this i will anyway since it took me a minute to write this out and might as well not have wasted that time good luck with your sweet life insulting people on the internet

LifeProTips,removed,kill yourself you autistic monkey it works just fine i use it on my bike and its buttery smooth without any any noises that you claim
LifeProTips,removed,i work in a psychiatry and do agree with the other commentators it is very important to deal with your grief and crying is a part of that however there is a technique that has helped some of my patients to get more control over their grieving process set a time every day where you take minutes to really go into your sadness think about your sister look at her pictures etc occupy yourself with nothing but this when the minutes are up stop and distract yourself with anything else doing so can make it easier to delay your grief when it threatens to overwhelm you at a bad time just remember that you will take your minutes later or the next day its like telling you body look i know i need to work through this but this is a bad time but i promise that i will feel these emotions that i need to feel just not right now of course i dont mean to only grief during these minutes when it feels right and appropriate cry when you need to the point is rather to delay it when it is not the right time or place most importantly i am sorry for your loss to lose someone you loved is a very difficult part of life and to cope with this one of the biggest challenges we have to face what you are feeling what is happening to you is nothing but natural and necessary i wish you all the best

LifeProTips,removed,yeah this reminds me of the religious trope about wealthhealth and faithgod if you follow god you will find your riches etc and if you dont your bad and thats why your poor or sick or whatever sometimes bad shit just happens and it would be too much for anyone to overcome and feeling shitty about it is completely justified it would be nice if life wasnt purposely exploited as a fucking race with winners and losers and people just helped each other out for a minute
LifeProTips,removed,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck you fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck you fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck you this is about as idiotic and explosive rageinducing as when someone says just try harder or things will get better or just dont think about it or just get over it its completely empty of actionable information while simultaneously completely invalidating please keep your stupid advice to yourself moving forward

LifeProTips,removed,i had one of the most horrible things happen to me my fiancé cheated on my and left me for her high school sweetheart i talk about it because i dont want it to be part of who i am years from now i know by confronting it i am a better person a stronger person and overall a happier person talking about it disarms it and doesnt allow it to take over your heart i dont shy away from it when people ask me i tell them exactly what happened and i am not ashamed or embarrassed because why should you be being a human being has these experiences in it it makes you a stronger person and how you react shows how much of a strong person you are
LifeProTips,removed,oh look new age mumbo jumbo every day this crap is on the frontpage

LifeProTips,removed,oh yeah great advice i just wont let it be a part of who i am ill just start living in a pretend house and work a pretend job and eat pretend food and pretend to not be trans and discriminated out from all basic needs of life what a solution it works out because in this society i am a pretend person with no fucking basic human rights fuck everything and fuck you
LifeProTips,removed,trying to reason with i think youre missing the point

LifeProTips,removed,you mean like left learning people do about white people why do people pretend that all the bigots are on the right anyone with two ears can see thats not true
LifeProTips,removed,yeah and as everyone knows calling a racist racist makes you racist
LifeProTips,removed,people who voted for trump are either behind his bigotry or they are okay with it there is no effective difference between the two apathy is just as dangerous as active hatred yes actually if hillary had said something so blatantly abusive had run on a platform of racism sexism islamaphobia classism ableism and basically further disenfranchisement for anyone who isnt a white christian straight cisgender male yes id feel exactly the same way about her and anyone who voted for her and probably be looking for a bridge to jump off if both of our candidates were so uniformly awful because it doesnt matter who does it its equally as crappy its not about championing a particular issue its about not championing the administration who literally wants to institute policies that will kill people it hit me so hard because no matter how much i gave dire warnings to the people who handwaved trumps chances away i never truly expected him to win i never ever in my heart of hearts believed that so many people in my country believed in his racist sexist ableist vile rhetoric the us is much more racist and backward than we ever thought
LifeProTips,removed,wong
LifeProTips,removed,i like to get them riled up i never argue with them just mention hillary etc and let them spin themselves up

LifeProTips,removed,nice try trump
LifeProTips,removed,fuck that youre a racist
LifeProTips,removed,this is exactly it too many morons on this website think that listening to both sides is the same thing is taking racist propaganda seriously if an ideology is based in hate and fear it is proper to summarily reject it you dont need to get into discussions with these clowns about their skewed crime statistics or the negroid head shape or whatever else theyre peddling lately to try to justify bigotry or ethnic cleansing
LifeProTips,removed,unless your interlocutor is a racist ignorant altrightconservative asshole who lacks any understanding of history economics and pretty much anything else in that case fuck them
LifeProTips,removed,me too but i enjoy trollingbeing a shit disturber so for its actually pretty awesome just saying you support donald trump in toronto makes people so triggered its pretty funny imo anyways
LifeProTips,removed,what a racist xenophobic sexist nazi thing to say
LifeProTips,removed,obama was the worst president we ever had i used to like marco rubio but ever since trump called him little marco i just cant take him seriously anymore the donald is just such a savage he is such a savage nah man im good on that shit
LifeProTips,removed,and rfullcommunism are self confessed marxists
LifeProTips,removed,hell yeah listen to trump
LifeProTips,removed,i just unfriended a long time friend because they wont stop replying with asinine nontruths he equated trumps tax returns with obamas birth certificate thats not a differing view youre just a bottom of the barrel moron im happy to listen to reasonable argument but sadly the vast portion of commonman trump supporters dont fucking have any trump his cabinet and his supporters are liars you cant reason with liars
LifeProTips,removed,but thats racist and nazi and trumpish
LifeProTips,removed,some liberal calls op a racist fascist
LifeProTips,removed,httpsiimgurcomlxrkijpg
LifeProTips,removed,lack of understanding leads to fear and fear leads to anger anger leads to violence and violence leads to jail calling me a racist and telling me to shut up will lead to your imprisonment and i think thats fucking hilarious
LifeProTips,removed,youre assuming the racist bigot that youre talking to is open to following this lpt thats an awfully tenuous assumption to make generally in such situations you just end up with the non racist getting more and more uncomfortable while the racist waxes philosophic about how much better it would be if all the black people would just go back to africa
LifeProTips,removed,i voted trump but i was temporarily banned from td just for asking a question that the mods labeled concern trolling i have been active on that sub for a while but its definitely an echo chamber just like rpolitics i respect the libs that post legitimate questions there and then get downvoted to eternity
LifeProTips,removed,caveat this does not include bigots
LifeProTips,removed,i said something similar to someone who was speaking out against discrimination and speaking for inclusion i asked why it wasnt ok to discriminate against anyone except for conservativeschristianstrump supporters and their answer was essentially because those people are wrong and what they believe is wrong they need to know that im paraphrasing just because some conservativeschristianstrump supporters are bigoted assholes doesnt mean they all are just like not all liberals are violent rioters
LifeProTips,removed,probably reply two omg liberals just label everything as racist this is why trump won probable reply three muslims arent a race
LifeProTips,removed,yippee im going to klan meeting and entertain their ideas
LifeProTips,removed,ill fight u
LifeProTips,removed,no im a white male theres a difference i swear
LifeProTips,removed,yes i agree there are individual black guys and girls that are completely normal and nice and whatever im not talking about that though thats not what i asked you im talking about the black race in general statistically as represented by facts and studies do you agree they are less intelligent on average
LifeProTips,removed,im an mra and regular user of mens rights forums and i always think its very telling how we want open and public discussions with feminists and invite those with a negative perception of the mens rights movement to visit our subreddit and ask questions while radical sjw start firebombs and violent protests to prevent a speaker from talking at a public university
LifeProTips,removed,i tried watching that but its massively brainwashy imo i stay away from political documentaries usually for both sides they tend to be very skewed i really wanted to enjoy that documentary but it just felt like i wasnt being told the whole story its so easy for authors to create a narrative and suck you in and then all of a sudden you are lost
LifeProTips,removed,except if you are a racist bigoted fascist womanizing republican amirite reddit kill whitey
LifeProTips,removed,thats surprising i lean rightlibertarian classical liberalism and i dont see much of that on subs that make it to rall rnews rpolitics fucking rpics are all and disaster of regressive sjw bs i am more of an rall peruser than anything else so maybe im just exposed to mostly lemmings
LifeProTips,removed,my grandparents survived a death camp throw a nazi salute or spout nazi bullshit in my presence it ends badly not like i aint been arrested for it before
LifeProTips,removed,you might want to add a caveat to that statementbecause i am not going to sit here and listen to neonazis white supremacist about how the aryan race is superior i am not stunting myself intellectually by any means and before you say but you can learn where they picked up these ideas try to understandrelate to themnope ask any serviceman who served in ask them if they would sit and listen
LifeProTips,removed,no those are the facts but okay explain to my why you voted for trump
LifeProTips,removed,so id have to surround myself with climate change deniers extremely religious people and sexist racist and this will make me a better person sure ill just book a ticket for the next plane to america then
LifeProTips,removed,i am a former liberal artsintercultural studiespolitical science student i worked in emergency services for eight years the oilfield for two and international relief and development for one this election season blew my mind there was tons of academic psychological and sociological analysis being done of trump supportersby people who had obviously never met a trump supporter they simply used their imagination to work backwards from the only goals they could imagine that trump supporters could be pursuing i very definitely did everything i could to get trump not electedbut i knew from firsthand experience that the representation of trump supporters in the media and perpetuated by most leftists was as false generalized stereotyped worstcasescendariod cherry picked and caricatured as most trump supporters impressions of immigrants refugees muslims and feminists in short every error you can make as a racist can be made as a tolerant person towards people in flyover country whom youve never met and quietly think are ignorant backwards and beneath you i have worked side by side with black people white people poor people rich people blue and white collar i found more diversity outside of higher education and the tolerant elite than i did within but i also found a lot of simmering racialclass distrust and a complete lack of faith in the basic institutions of government media and education and i found a ton of people who prided themselves on being tolerant and knowledgeable who had no idea what life was like for the poor and marginalized people they talk so freely about ymmv
LifeProTips,removed,i agree with this lpt and have tried to use it in the past few years my issue though is that recently there is nothing to listen to with people either whom i strongly agree or disagree debate in seems to have been reduced to who has the wittiest memes or who can call the other retarded first i want to hear a great argument that allows me to see the world from your point of view what i get are insults
LifeProTips,removed,unless theyre literally saying i want white people to be the superior racewhite people are the superior race its only your own conclusion and not a fact example the kkk would actually tell you they consider black people to be inferior
LifeProTips,removed,i mostly agree but those who i most strongly agree with havent said anything more intelligent than oh the lubral tears if they do i will listen but they dont want to debate or even state theri side most of the time because their ideas have no backing with logic or science or history so they just drop down to the lowest common denominator and scream oh libural tears so on the surface i agree but the opposition went off in crazy infantile land a while back there is nothing to listen to unless you want to spend an hour on how retarded it is to think hilary is running a child sex ring out of a random pizza joint in nc and thats what you get when you demand something more intelligent than oh lubral tears
LifeProTips,removed,twoxchromosomes moderators should read this statement
LifeProTips,removed,but but but they are racist xenophobic sexist islamaphobic hate riots and throws rocks
LifeProTips,removed,really because my next question would be why do you believe black people arent human i dont understand how that is in any way a bad response arent you fascinated by what is inside the head of someone who thinks that you think youll change their mind by railing at them instead
LifeProTips,removed,yes i really thought about this showerthought the last days but if it comes to thedonald its just wasting your time they dont even have viewpoints they just love trump pretty much every argument is obama did a similar thing you cant challenge your viewpoints with that
LifeProTips,removed,theres no dialogue to be had with white supremacists weve let them explain what they believe often enough and maybe your friends dont take them seriously but more and more people are willing to jump on that bandwagon if the alternative is fighting then were going to have to stick up for what we believe in
LifeProTips,removed,id agree but anytime i say anything positive about trump i get called a racist fascist bigot islamaphobic transphobic nazi
LifeProTips,removed,you will never convince them that they are wrong this is all you needed to post youre never going to convince racists to stop being racist because the entire idea is just a kink in the way human psychology handles out groups it isnt rational or arguable
LifeProTips,removed,yeah it bugs me when some people on this website say youre just intolerant of opposing views when people protest the altright or whatever like theres opposing views in the sense of a debate about tax rates in which both sides have reasonable informed opinions and then theres opposing views in the sense of copypasta manifestos about brown people and jews written by a bunch of racist uncles nobody is under any obligation to treat reactionary bigoted uninformed opinions with the same respect as informed opinions in fact acting like youre in a reasonable debate with a white supremacist lends their beliefs more credibility than they ever deserve
LifeProTips,removed,i think the difference in calling reddit an echo chamber and calling td an echo chamber is what they pretend to be td doesnt pretend to be a place for open discussion just like i wouldnt expect sfp to be a place for open discussion certain subreddits however like rpolitcs actually should be about open discussion about political matters instead of certain ideas being afraid of being harassed deleted by mods or in some of the worst cases doxxed the same goes with rnews rpoliticaldiscussion and im sure theres more

LifeProTips,removed,some things especially political stuff are too controversial for people to feel confidentsafe speaking out publicly against there are still ways for their voice to be heard even if not broadcasting to the world how they feel they can vote they can boycott they can divest and in terms of social relationships they can even ignore and distance themselves from others using the example of trump because its current and relatable but this principle transcends a lot of this it deals with friends professional relationships social circles and obviously politics it doesnt have to just be politics it can be anything that is difficult to talk about it was the perceived widespread expectation that trump would lose the election and by a lot it wasnt even a contest then trump won he won by a landslide according to the electoral college at least people did speak up by voting at that point you would think the liberal mainstream would get some perspective and understand that their thoughts were not as popular as they thought nope they protested convinced that the election was rigged they continue to protest convinced that they are the majority view meanwhile although they unequivocally have the loudest voice they are still not the majority except for a few the media was projecting a stock market dip if trump won the election nope investors spoke up by buying into the market and driving prices skyward expressing their confidence in trump again the loudest voice was not the majority the market is still high as i write this meaning that the confidence in trump from institutional individual investors and businesses has not wavered despite the media projecting a sense of widespread hatred for his administration everything is about social awareness which too few people have these days

LifeProTips,removed,this another worthless lifeprotip flooding the sub forum
LifeProTips,removed,in other words how do you stop yourself from being a typical redditor
LifeProTips,removed,i find that i tend to listen to what people say then i answer by relating my own experience of something similar i spend my life telling myself im a horrible person because of this the two things i have learned you are not a horrible person if you relate stories about yourself focus on your intentions here is it actually your intention to make it all about you or are you jumping to the conclusion that thats how theyll take it to help with this think of all the times youve told a story and someone else related their own story that was similar to your experience did it bother you never bothers me if im honest im totally cool with people getting excited and im interested in hearing about other people are you anxious when youre speaking often the way for me to make sure im not just interjecting or talking too much is to listen to my emotions with me its always anxiety the urge to speak is always anxiety if i take some deep breaths and try to calm down i feel far more comfortable in the conversation and more able to focus on what is being said to me without interjecting forgive yourself you have explained that you are interested in other people and concerned for how they feel and you are worried about your own tendencies and how they might affect others thats nice of you remember that no one is perfect no one we are not all active listeners all of the time actually i really cant think of many people who are we all make mistakes and youre allowed to make mistakes it does not make you completely unlikeable lastly if you just ask questions and seem interested in other people without relating stories of your own its actually quite alienating for other people following the active listening stuff to the letter is not a good thing imo i have a friend who does this and i always walk away feeling ashamed and alone its not that shes saying anything wrong its that the way she focuses on me makes me without relating anything about herself makes me feel like theres something different about me or that she cant relate to how i feel i have another friend who i much prefer to talk to she interrupts a lot ill be honest and does tend to interject with her own stories but then she apologies after her story and says sorry i interrupted you there go on i much prefer to go to her for support because when i say this happened and i felt this way she says oh id be exactly the same this happened to me and i felt that way too and then i dont feel ashamed so what im saying is that you might be being too self critical here calm the anxiety to prevent you from dominating if you feel you are and again dont worry i do this too but also give yourself a break
LifeProTips,removed,im certain you can find many lectures on youtube also you might check those free online courses that some very nice universities offer there are a plethora of highly informative websites and books out there as well if i were you i would look into textbooks for the classes but look for an older edition these are an excellent source and thats a cheap way to get them hold on and ill edit in a link or two

LifeProTips,removed,not exactly the same thing but as a full time pedestrian in the uk i hate it when car drivers try to wave at me to let me cross at a crossing even though its green for them in the past this has given me a false sense of security and nearly led to accidents because sometimes there are two lanes of traffic or the crossing is near a complex junction with traffic coming from other directions or motorbikes are weaving between traffic etc the driver simply cant safely make the call for me i need to pay attention to the pedestrian lights andor be aware of the roads myself and make my own judgement there is a particular crossing near where i live where drivers regularly try to wave me across because traffic often builds up around the crossing and cars have to stop or slow before it anyway after a close call with a motorbike i now ignore them one driver was actually visibly annoyed at me when i rejected her offer by shaking my head and waiting steadfastly

LifeProTips,removed,as a blind pedestrian also dont wave us through an intersection seriously dont honk at us nobody understands what you are trying to convey in honk morse code its startling and totally unhelpful dont open your window and try and tell us to go ahead or try to tell us when to cross you are at the very least distracting us from analyzing the traffic i often have to turn back from the curb to dissuade a car from waiting for me and at worse making a dangerous recommendation you might know that someone is crossing and wait only for them to get run over by another car if you do this if you are in a car leave us alone and focus on driving safely seriously more generally read your dmv handbook and follow all local guidelines regarding blind and sighted pedestrians here are httpswwwdmvcagovportaldmvdetailpubshdbkshrpedworkpeds laws in your area likely have wording that requires extra caution and sometimes giving total right of way to blind pedestrians in all circumstances know and follow them crossing the street is safest and most efficient for blind pedestrians and literally everyone else when you pay attention follow the law and drive in a normal and predictable pattern

LifeProTips,removed,i believe that any time a steak is cooked more than mediumrare that its the single biggest mistake in all of history every time it happens its worse than the last time because havent we learned anything dont people realize how bad overcooked steak tastes i know its a personal preference but i believe steaks are at their absolute best when cooked mediumrare its the perfect temperature for a nice piece of meat the steaks should start out at room temperature i can always tell when somebodys cooking a steak right out of the fridge it never really cooks as evenly the center taking just a little longer to get to that sweetspot the exterior drying out while the middle takes forever to come down from the cold ill still always say wow great steak but im really just being polite ideally whoever is cooking is going to want to heat up their grill or frying pan or whatever get it really really hot almost smoking so that way the outside will have that nice char that crisp brown and then when you cut into it man its great red to the center warm interior so i always order my steak mediumrare unless of course im sitting at a table in a steakhouse with a large group of people in that case its not so simple im a gentlemen so i never just go ahead and order first ill hold off for somebody else to start and then ill wait until its my turn to order chances are somebody else is going to order their steak mediumrare im telling you its the best way to have a steak but then the waiter will come around to me and for you sir how would you like your steak prepared i cant say mediumrare now ill look like i have no idea what im doing ill look like ive never ordered a steak before and now im just copying everybody else this is why its great to order first at a steak place everyone else is definitely going to get their steak mediumrare so when you order first you look like youre in charge like everyone else is following your lead then the second person also says mediumrare very good sir and maybe he really did want his steak mediumrare it all depends on how fast he said it if there was even a seconds hesitation it would be perfectly obvious that he was probably going to go for medium but he didnt feel like being outdone by the first person ill take mine medium rare mediumrare a classic rookie ivenevereateninasteakhousewithalargegroupofpeople mistake and then it goes down the line mediumrare mediumrare mediumrare but now everybody ordering the fifth sixth seventh even if they wanted medium mediumwell its just not happening nobodys going to stick their neck out like that by the third or fourth person the waiter is only even asking because he has to because its part of his job description bosses always gets really pissed when waiters try to save some time try to cast out a blanket mediumrares all around question to the table every once in a while the waiter will start off with a person who clearly doesnt know how to eat steak and theyll say medium or mediumwell and the next person will order theirs extra loud mediumrare as if to say please dont confuse me with my idiot friend to my left id like mine mediumrare please and itll go down the line mediumrare mediumrare and after two or three people that first guy will realize his mistake and hell get really embarrassed and hell just shout out to the waiter whos already passed him and hell say excuse me you know what im going to go for that mediumrare also thanks and the waiter will say very good sir and hell pretend to cross out something on his pad and write in something else but it will all be an act because hes not writing anything at all its always mediumrare the first person always changes to mediumrare after everyone else orders mediumrare its a science but then it gets to me maybe im like the eighth or ninth person ordering and im no follower im no nameless face in a crowd so ill say rare please and everyone drops their fork and stares i learned this trick at my friends wedding in iowa last summer the rehearsal dinner was at this steak place and the specialty was ribeye delish of course i was going to order mediumrare but the first person ordered rare i was like what rare crazy but then the second person ordered rare third fourth fifth rare rare rare there was definitely a pattern here and it became clear to me how id have to order my steak it was good i liked it its a little chewier than i was used to you have to cut the pieces really thin so its somewhat manageable in your mouth but its nice i still like mediumrare better but ill never tell that to anybody ill only order that if its just me and somebody else or if im cooking the steak myself from now on when im at a steak restaurant with a lot of people rare it is im a oneofakind kind of a guy i just love it sitting there mediumrare mediumrare mediumrare mediumrare and rare bam i always stand out from the pack i really hope that someday im out to dinner with a bunch of guys and for some reason its my turn to order first and im definitely going to order rare and i know that that second person is just going to have to order rare also and itll be like dominoes everyone falling in line everyone getting a rare steak im pretty sure thats what happened in iowa i think just do me a favor and never order a steak welldone i have it on good authority that whenever a chef at a steak restaurant gets an order for a well done steak he walks over to a nearby trashcan where under all of the trash he keeps a stockpile of some of last weeks worst cuts of meat after he pulls the nastiest one out he spits on it a few times and then he throws it on the grill until all thats left is a charred blackened piece of coal then he puts on some parsley and sends it out to be served its true i swear ps i hate it when people order medium to mediumwell thats not a temperature pick medium or medium well there are five temperatures thats it you cant just go around making up your own weird nonexistent styles of preparing steak

LifeProTips,removed,i used to masturbate onto birds at a local park not a thing that im particularly proud of but i became quite good at it i was taking zinc supplements so i was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me for anyone interested here is your best strategy first you need to find an isolated spot so you dont become a sex offender i found a short kind of channel area where i saw the pigeons would congregate next you arouse yourself i was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if youre not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go after youre good an horny you get some bread my pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain fat unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum i was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to feet you wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence at this point you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust now youre finally ready to cum on your bird this is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds so you have to be subtle once you master a technique you simply wind it up and let it go aiming depending on your past cumming experiences i always came high so i would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face its an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city either way i havent done it in years but every now and then i catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me

LifeProTips,removed,i think toxic masculinity is one of those fashionable terms and very politically charged it is strongly related to the feminism vs red pill culture wars that are just used generically and not necessarily applicable to every situation i mean what is necessarily more masculine or more toxic suffering silently or lashing out in anger both can be seen as so it is not like not a lot of women chose to suffer silently too my idea of some super masculine alpha man would be actual more of a very angry type a silent sufferer is not so radically masculine imho all this buttoning up is not a strong masculine thing it is not what you would image dwayne the rock or wolverine or other masculine role models would be doing they would rage instead it is actually a feature of somewhat timid introverted and rather gentle men my dad too was a silent sufferer but it was because the alternative would have been yelling at my mom to stop being such an insufferable selfish nagging bitch but he was too nice too much of a gentleman to do that so he swallowed his anger and suffered in silence this is something a typical niceguy does not an ultramasculine rambo

LifeProTips,removed,look at what a social expert i am if you only you autistic peasants were as adept as me

LifeProTips,removed,sometimes people shouldnt be validated though when theyre mostly wrong and validation enables or encourages them to repeat that behavior its also a bad idea if someone lives in a sheltered bubble and their perspective is skewed accordingly when no one steps up and drops the hard truth and normalizes a skewed perspective thats how michael jacksons drift off into weirdo territory and how donald trump walks around thinking his hairstyle is its inhumane

LifeProTips,removed,hi im studying sport sciences in france especially adapted physical activities and health something i believe is that physical activity programs are oldschool because doesnt consider athletes as a human with personnals motivations goals way of thinking so when you follow a plan you become a human body trying to survive by practising physical activity the new school in my opinion is to help athlete to express themself by physical practise trainers should stop planify to start thinking about giving the possibilities to their athlètes to express themself durine physical practise

LifeProTips,removed,relaxing doesnt require sitting or doing nothing you can go for a hike for a bicycle ride for a swim which takes you away from your work station and keeps you from writing you can go see a movie a game a play whatever you enjoy you can still sit but instead of working do a crossword puzzle read a novel knit paint play guitar just do anything that isnt work the idea is to clear your mind and take it away from the drudgery of the work you need to be doing so it is focused on something different for a little while

LifeProTips,removed,you literally went out and said what i just said not to do no offense to anyone but i dont think anyone goes onto reddit to read about how to have common decency and not shit on people with problems and all the stuff you mentioned are deeply ingrained problems people have a little lpt on reddit isnt going to make any sort of difference to how these people think and react to stuff anything short of real profession counseling and longterm commitment wont fix someone with anger management for example being a nice person isnt a tip or is pro in any sort of way neither is a short lecture on what it feels like to have mental issues its a nice sort of psa sure but seems pretty off topic when the point is to post little tricks and tips
LifeProTips,removed,harming harming harming harming okay then whatever you say
LifeProTips,removed,okay first of all if you have any sort of these personality accessories mental flaws then whatever you do is on you first and foremost that individual cannot control the public and their peers any more than this lame attempt at a lpt can youre providing a proverbial shield for an activity that someone with that ailment wouldnt even put themselves into if it were as severe as you need it to be to support your fight did you remove this post or did mods fitting either way

LifeProTips,removed,when was the last time a single vote made a difference i live in alameda county i wanted to vote republican in the last election but my vote will not make a difference democrats outnumber us here by a lot so my county will always go blue just having more people vote is not the smart way of doing this you can never be sure if there are enough to outnumber the ones who vote against you and you also dont know if their votes will count for what you want because they may not vote the same way as you do the best thing to do is convince droves of nonvoters to vote a certain way and also convert people who vote differently from you to your side
LifeProTips,removed,unless you are donald trump
LifeProTips,removed,your parents are dead
LifeProTips,removed,to be fair michael is autistic and doesnt know any better
LifeProTips,removed,youre an idiot
LifeProTips,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

LifeProTips,removed,holy fuck what a stupid post are we posting common sense as a life protip now
LifeProTips,removed,in some states if he stepped towards you in that threatening manner on your property after youd asked him to leave you could shoot him in the face
LifeProTips,removed,and you think one has a gun
LifeProTips,removed,fcking cuk
LifeProTips,removed,unfortunately i came off that way but i agree i am definitely for proper use of force and the analogy i shared does not properly reflect what i would have actually done as a gun owner my rules of engagement escalation of force i would have personally gone in the house shut the door to draw the physical line between me and them unholster gun say though the door i am not interested and to please exit my property if still an issue rack a round and then tell them to leave if they did not comply with my request say any attempt to enter my house or anything else towards me will be considered a threat and i will shoot to kill then get on the phone with the cops and make them aware of the situation if at any point in that situation they tried to break through that physical barrier between me and them or of they tried attempted attack before i got in obviously its time to asjust my response accrordingly i have only had to do this once and it was for a guy who was being very adamant about wanting to come in my house to discuss my security system and plan he had to offer i shut the door after he just wouldnt take a hint and tried to even step up to the threshold to sort of welcome himself inside wasnt like a threat but i definitely got really uncomfortable he left after i told him i had all the security i need and to please leave immediately his story reminded me of that time and scenario i have since gone over in my head a million times
LifeProTips,removed,if something like this happened in the states we would probably just shoot them tbh fam
LifeProTips,removed,what about the opposite lpt setting and goal and talking about it so youre extra committed out of fear of looking like an idiot
LifeProTips,removed,lol seriously people are saying to go get their guns what the fuck that takes some serious lack of social skills if thats the best course of action fucking christ
LifeProTips,removed,theres some black people here with guns they are asking where the white women at
LifeProTips,removed,this is another reason i have an seriously i would go in straight away grab in and just go back to my porch with it in my hand id probably go ahead and load one in the chamber and ask them to leave if the still refused id tell them im calling the cops go back in and watch them through my blinds with in hand if they kicked in the door id shoot through the door and kill them both on the spot fuck what the law says if you step to me like that at my house and ive given you plenty of warning ill take my chances in court
LifeProTips,removed,and theyre black
LifeProTips,removed,also its generally agreed that within the walls of your house you can claim defense but just being on your property can be less cut and dry yup had a shooting not too far from me where a guy got fucked because of this a few dumbfucks in a van rolled up to a house and knocked on the door tenant opens the door and gets a gun in the face the dumbfucks are armed burglars who want to clear out his house dumbfucks make a bit of a racket and tenants roommate comes out of his bedroom with a shotgun dumbfucks cut and run one makes it back into the van two are on the lawn running away shotgun follows them one of the ones on the lawn turns around to shoot at shotgun who immediately puts him down before shooting the other fleeing dumbfuck in the back i dont remember what happened to the one who made it to the van anyways shotgun was convicted for shooting the guy who was running away which he deserved since the guy was no longer engaging him but he was also convicted for shooting the first guy who had turned around and aimed his gun at him because he was no longer in shotguns house despite still being on the lawn part of the property and shotgun was no longer legally justified in using lethal force even though it was clearly still selfdefense
LifeProTips,removed,its also always common sense
LifeProTips,removed,and youre just a cunt
LifeProTips,removed,and then the police come anyway after you keep saying its okay the people have left then the police look at your dog and say they feel threatened they then shoot your dog and point their guns at you hoping youll make a move theyve not shot a human in at least two weeks so trigger fingers are getting itchy since your dog is dead and two uniformed thugs are pointing guns at your head you get down on the ground with your hands behind your head the uniformed thugs then ransack your property taking items at will and just before you think theyre about to leave they arrest you for having a bag of cocaine on the property you didnt so now youre in jail waiting for your lawyer and one of the pigs who arrested you comes into your cell and shows you a picture of your girlfriend who is currently out of town for a few days they tell you in no uncertain terms that if you tell your lawyer who is being barred from seeing you currently exactly what happened then your girlfriend will be the victim of a most unfortunate violation in the end your life is ruined completely you are released from prison after three years with a multitude of scars both mental and physical you lost your girlfriend and house years before and all the people in your town think youre a drug dealer all of this because you trusted the cops to protect and serve

LifeProTips,removed,blind person who uses a screenreader here shitty ads can make pages difficult or impossible to access with screen readers in addition to being annoying and potentially malware infested and so virtually all competent blind computer users will be using ad blockers if a site doesnt allow me to use ad blocking i typically just dont use it its shitty now that more and more sites are blocking ad blocker users its also shitty being told well you should just be okay with another form of website inaccessibility and exclusion because theres other sites you can visit

LifeProTips,removed,so instead of retracing your steps youre supposed to look where you didnt go when my wife loses something i always ask her about the last place or time she remembers using it then we think back of what she did since the object is inevitably found somewhere along that path
LifeProTips,removed,this is the dumbest advice ive read in a while if you go hiking or are in a place you dont know dont go alone always bring a friend if you get lost and i mean really lost you should have told people where you were going first this is how people get found oh im going to blah blah if you dont hear from he in days look for me
LifeProTips,removed,how did it go when you hit submit and reread your title
LifeProTips,removed,its not about getting lost its that you didnt tell someone where you were going people who legitimately get lost are one of two people people exploring or total morons
LifeProTips,removed,lol fam u fat tho

LifeProTips,removed,i would also add following items med kit should have in car anyway fire extinguisher should have in car anyway fire steel flares multi tool hunting knife small axe small shovel during winter especially food items like granola bars mres etc water was already mentioned add a steel cup you can smelt snowcrushed water bottle ice in over fire or but onto a hot engine block thermos to keep hot beverage or soup in blanket or sleeping bag small matyoga mat if you need to work under car in rough terrain or sleep outsidelay down small metal plate to stabilize jack in softrough terrain in case you need to change tire toothbrush and toothpaste a book and a magazine good also to have when you wait around for someone gloves were mentioned before but i recommend also add a pair of dirty work gloves with rubberized grip helps a ton if you need that extra grip protection from cuts hot engine block and from smearing your hands sounds lot added to the existing list but packing everything tightly down and spread out between glove compartment trunk seat and door pockets and a small duffel bag that you can easily move around it does not take up terribly much space most of the items are not expensive either especially spread out over weeks or couple of months and it is a cheap insurance for when shit hits the fan and a good help for different scenarios such as if suddenly someone calls you up for a dip in the lake then you have towel and clothing replacements i liked someones tip regarding spare phone and will take that one to heart i think there is a nokia phone that has like several hundred hours standby and hours talking time

LifeProTips,removed,hey there nachofirme i appreciate your willingness to look out for the betterment of the general public one quick thing that i may add though is that ive had prior experience with working in vector marketing for over months and was able to actually make and save as a high school senior saving up for expenses in college now i did bust my ass but fortunately i was an adaptive individual who learned how to manage his time to the point of balancing relationships academics athletics and a means to save up money for bettering myself and attempting to reduce the financial burden off of my parents it isnt for everyone but in a company where its not required you pay anything to begin can develop improved orating skills and represent the highest quality of cutlery in america that benefits many families isnt necessarily anything but a difficult job that most young adults may not have the aptitude to handle which honestly isnt a terrible thing its dedication and like i mentioned not for everyone its an experiential thing but unfortunately for humans money is a necessity in the contorted way governing bodies and societies work so a means to gain some of that in an outgoing and positive manner for the people who receive cutco again isnt such a pyramid scheme or detriment at all thanks

LifeProTips,removed,it is not always somewhere between the two poles there are cases where the belief is outside either pole for a specific example take the holocaust when the first reports of extermination of jews came to the allies they were dismissed as exaggerated these reports were extreme and most people did not accept them only after mounting evidence did people come to realize that the nazis were running an extermination program however this extreme belief was not extreme enough when allied forces liberated concentration camps they were shocked at the level of suffering they saw they had adopted the onceextreme belief in an extermination program but the reality was considerably worse this happens all the time in science every unexpected result in science is by definition outside the spectrum of what people currently believe

LifeProTips,removed,your average person is dying to talk your ear off the easiest way is to just say hi and let them hijack the conversation theres several books written by con artists basically talking about this principle be a cup let them spill into you remove ego and just listen to everything they say and ask relevant questions even if it makes you look done never gossip or state something youre not sure is true and never speak ill of anyone unless someone else does it first in a big way and even then err on the side of well its all new to me or ive heard that before but ive never really spoken to them
LifeProTips,removed,thank you for the detailed advice on how to interface with fellow humans

LifeProTips,removed,you can criticize something without having the right words to explain what would make it better i dont think the lack of a solution always equates complaining to whining as long as there is some sense that the complaint is being made to illustrate what the problem is so that a solution can be found you can tell when someone is complaining just for the sake of doing so if they keep rejecting viable solutions its an outspoken trait of people who enjoy being able to see themselves as a victim

LifeProTips,removed,
LifeProTips,removed,yes but i think its okay to feel angry sometime sometimes it is but not over a long period of time not recurrently its not healthy dont just forgive otherwise abusers will take advantage of you wishing the offender well not if they dont see what they did wrong i cannot forgive without the expectation of some justice or even without any response now youre rationalizing anger and looking for reasons not to forgive if you do that youre basically holding onto unhealthy defense mechanisms instead of choosing to move on if youre ok with unhealthy so be it but dont pretend its okay

LifeProTips,removed,forgiving accepting and forgetting theres a lot of overlap between the three and they can mean different things to different people i think the most important aspect though regardless of ones definition is to do the following learn to let go keeping anger inside will only hurt yourself if someone is genuinely remorseful and wants to make amends because they value the relationship great if youre dealing with a toxic person who causes damage and never apologizes or thinks they did anything wrong cut this person out of your life

LifeProTips,removed,not useful at all like every other post here
LifeProTips,removed,so he actually tells some factswell then as i said earlier what is the tip
LifeProTips,removed,years sober here if youve reached the just one more bit of selftalk you have already used in every way that matters short of actually ingesting the substance getting sober and staying sober are two very different things i know a lot of addicts that will get sober for a year just so their tolerance will go back down they never had any desire to stay sober and then there are some like me that get sober and stay sober the entire time its a trade if you trade your substance in then you should get something back in return equivalent exchange if i give up my right to a chemical solution then i should get a better solution but try and convince a heroin addict that meditation beats the nod believe me its a losing proposition the trade must be comprehensive can you detox and allow your body to recover can you find support to help your brain rewire itself can you face life alone and accept the worst parts of it without seeking the chemical solution can you do it every day until you die only you can answer those questions but i can say this so far the trade has worked out for me

LifeProTips,removed,u r retarded
LifeProTips,removed,then they will catch the ghey
LifeProTips,removed,so as a white male would showanda be a good choice
LifeProTips,removed,in my teens i had to drive home a drink dude from my friends house as i was the only one sober random guy there says i can take his car so i dont waste my gas the car ended up being a mercedes brabus this model after some mods was about long story short i got a flat and forgot to loosen the nuts before jacking up the car the jack slipped out from underneath the car and dinged the rim pretty good not my brightest moment
LifeProTips,removed,right but as an autistic person i was never able to handle socks its a really bad sensory issue for me the are options other than forcing children to do things that are uncomfortable for them part of doing your best to take care of a chid is to listen to them and figure out alternative solutions if something seems like it is not working
LifeProTips,removed,i do this as soon as i get back home from getting my tires changed because it seems that all of the tire places in the world have a gorilla in the back room that cant read torque specs and is there just to over tighten lug nuts over tighten i wish thats what i had to deal with i was less than feet from the tire shop when i saw the first of my tires rolling down the street ahead of me in the end only one actually stayed on the car id take over tightened over not tightened at all any day
LifeProTips,removed,definitely dont pour it off your back deck my dog stopped eating that mud about down
LifeProTips,removed,can confirm am retarded fixed

LifeProTips,removed,im going to go with feed him to the pigs what detective is going to sift through pig poo to search for dna or mix him with lye and make soap out of him then send a lifetime supply of soap to his parents
LifeProTips,removed,am not amercian whole world lost with trump
LifeProTips,removed,trump just got elected president frankly i dont think humanity will be around long enough to show anyones grandkids much of anything p
LifeProTips,removed,this election has proven that the news media is in sad shape the media is in sad shape because of its own actions not because of something donald trump did or did not do the media openly and willingly supported hrc which is not the medias role that left a bad taste in many readers mouths the media didnt properly vet or cover obama during his tenure i support businesses that produce goods and services i think are worth supporting i wont toss a business a few bucks because i feel sorry for them because they are inept at their job in fact we are better off by not giving print media a handout as this will force them to adapt to the markets needs
LifeProTips,removed,donald trumps inauguration is this weekend everyone here seems convinced its the beginning of the end of the world the beginning of world war and the first step toward the nuclear apocolypse still it might be nice to have a reminder of the end of one of the most controversial elections in history and reminder of why thing happened the way the did
LifeProTips,removed,except that many folks who make too much to contribute to a roth ira in the first place also make too much to realize any tax benefit tax me now or tax me later im already in the highest bracket nowhere to go but down unless of course tax rates increase which is impossible to predict
LifeProTips,removed,assuming that if someone cant find a job its just because he isnt looking theyre not lazy and weak theyre dealing with bad stuff both conservative and progressive intellectuals say trump voters are racist dumb when a conservative looks at a minority community and says theyre lazy the left answers wait a minute lets look at the larger context the availability of jobs structural injustice but the left looks at white workingclass poverty and feels free to judge and dismiss
LifeProTips,removed,i know a girl she has pictures and she covers her in all of them was actually annoying
LifeProTips,removed,my is cyanide pill
LifeProTips,removed,seems to be a recurring theme on reddit i was banned from rdebatereligion after refusing to join a circlejerk on how great islam is and the mod was a total dick about it calling me a racist on his subreddit after banning me
LifeProTips,removed,arent like only for people with a job
LifeProTips,removed,plan for the worst is where im getting that number from in other words lower your expectations from the getgo just because the market is at a high doesnt mean it will always be at a high especially when you have various economists including those whove won the nobel prize in economics stating that trumps presidency could push the us into another deep recession will the roi stay at i damn well hope for it but for all you know the stock market could tank like it did in in the next four to eight years because new leadership is ranging between grossly incompetent and morally bankrupt with goals of pushing bills into law that are going to generate a great deal of domestic and foreign uncertainty hope for the best and plan for the worst
LifeProTips,removed,or just having some common sense it should be obvious that it is easiest to loosen the bolts a little before jacking it up safer and more fricktion to stop tire spinning while loosening em so are you stupid or what same as saying someone either taught you or you learned the hard way about do not eat poop
LifeProTips,removed,sterilize yourself do the world wonders or just dont be a dog piece of shut
LifeProTips,removed,common sense what

LifeProTips,removed,start off with easy to accomplish or simple goals ie push ups a day and slowly progress yourself to bigger and better ones i found setting total weekly goals and specific ones for each day really made it easier using workout apps really helps imo know what you are gonna do in the gym before you go that way you will feel more confident about being there since you wont seem as lostnew watch youtube videos on how to properly use workout machines and how to lift right try to blank out your mind when you go like listen to music that allows you to zone out and just try to forget any issues you are dealing with in your life i have motivation problems too but since i dont really think about anything in the gym it doesnt really affect my workouts

LifeProTips,removed,im not saying your friend was wrong to leave but i would have handled it differently first upon returning to the seat your friend should have take different efforts to establish dominance but in a more respectful way think of it this way a good leader doesnt need to make others feel bad to get them to do what he wants saying up you go is pretty insulting and entrenches the guy to stay there also saying i paid for it is a really pathetic thing to say and implies that everyone is more dominant than him i would have done this upon returning put my arm around the guy making him super unconformable and say hey thank you so much for keeping my seat warm how are you im monty whats your name putting my hand out to shake his and then gripping really hard during the hand shake talk a little bit like two sentences and then if he doesnt get up by then say hey man my knees are really killing me can i sit back down and then if he still doesnt get up say ok im going to stand right here and wait for you then go stand behind him and totally clown him by giving him bunny ears making faces mocking his demeanor pulling out my wallet acting like hes paying to talk to her mocking his gold chain and doing other stuff so your date can see you but he cant your date will laugh hysterically eventually hell turn around get mad and it wont matter because your date will like you by then

LifeProTips,removed,nah ive reached that point too many times failed to change too many times all thats left to do is give up
LifeProTips,removed,i respect the thought but i kind of think this advice is like when youre taking a crap and the only thing available is sand paper to wipe with just bite the bullet and dont wipe youll be able to find toilet paper soon and wiping with sand paper is likely to be irritating to the skin who doesnt know this

LifeProTips,removed,best lighter ive ever owned originally built as a novelty product for stoners but i feel that theyre useful for much more fuel is a huge burden to carry while most hardware runs on battery additionally if you dont use an iphone most products you have will be usbmicro charged these things have hundreds of lights in them as well windproofness theres no flame to blow out its kind of a mindfck you can blow on this as hard as you can and it still wont go out durability hard metal case ive had mine for over years and i still take it backpacking its also great for cutting lines to start a fire its also great if you bring some laundry lint to light

LifeProTips,removed,if you use a camping stove these little firesteel tools are great i find that matches even the waterproof ones are quite unreliable and expensive and lighters are a pain in the wind the firesteel provides an infinite supply of sparks which is all you need to light most stoves
LifeProTips,removed,stop in the middle of the road and then wait for them to mob the car once they are all crowded around press the self destruct button
LifeProTips,removed,run zig zag if you can dodging behind objects as you go i remember a video of a man being chased by somebody with a gun the guy being chased kept dodging around a tree so that the chaser never could get the gun pointed at him even though he was inches away hide behind bulletproof objects if possible brick wall automobile a locked door could work stay quiet and keep those around you quiet also turn out the lights where you are to fight is your last resort if you can get others to join in all the better but fight like youve never fought before go for eyes knees groin you want to hold nothing back
LifeProTips,removed,youre saying that you have if im right about one im still right i never said anything about all people who are addicted to something if addicts need something they are knows to lie steal cheat and beg to get it cigarettes can be an addiction maybe not as significant as meth but it still is perhaps you should focus more time on coming up with a good lpt instead of being a dick

LifeProTips,removed,am i the only one who wonders if the alternate political commentary makes sense to you and kind people in comments paint it in even more vivid colours for you why do you keep disagreeing with them and continue being entitled millennial faggot oo
LifeProTips,removed,how about dont be a retard
LifeProTips,removed,lol this explains a lot about you thats why you keep saying go to bed you still live with mommy and daddy and cant find a job and you have no marketable skills cause youre broke idk why i even gave someone like you a reply youre a waste of air who is contributing nothing to the world and in another post you say you dont have time to volunteer gtfoh youre just lazy are you overweight too i bet you are

LifeProTips,removed,how about you dont just assume people are trying to be malicious you fucking cunt
LifeProTips,removed,have the time theyre just attention seeking teens that need to be put in their place call them out tell them to man up dont throw them a potty party this advice is stupid
LifeProTips,removed,aka how to grow a bumper crop of losers
LifeProTips,removed,but its not helpful just because your unable to listen to others without being self indulged asshole doesnt mean their advice wasnt worthy or applicable your not special and other people do have experience in these matters sorry but im just sick of how we treat people with mental illnesses as if their the normal ones and we have to change our ways to fit their messed up position
LifeProTips,removed,i bet you cant stab yourself to death with that kind of sword
LifeProTips,removed,or kill yourself because no one is obliged to pity you because of your madeup social sigma
LifeProTips,removed,or just stop being a pussy you ever try that
LifeProTips,removed,anxiety and depression have you tried being a man
LifeProTips,removed,wow great more demands from mentally ill people
LifeProTips,removed,what i dont have to imagine that im depressed and anxious to understand what are you doing wrong to make your brain think that you feel that way sure i do understand medical or chronical illness is something that some people cannot really understand but all this mental shit is in your head and it is easy fixable with listening to a proper advice same thing is someone is hung up on fucking girl and he will do stupidest shit while everyone is telling him to dump her at the end they get married and have a divorce in a few years well there goes years down the drain for not listening to people that see from the side all this depression shit is so fake if you dont have real reason to be depressed and if you do have a real reason to be depressed then someone should comfort you about the reason not the consequences that makes you depressed depression is just sign of a weak mind or super strong mind but in cases it is weak mind meaning that you allow subconscious and other mental shit get to you and do not control shit
LifeProTips,removed,its a difference if it is a health condition or depression if its health related you can have my empathy and my time however if you are depressed i beat the shit out of you mentally i remember having that time in life where everything seemed sensless etc im not going to go further here until someone woke me up i realized how stupid it was if you tell me youre depressed ill tell you its your own fault its your life you have it in your hands to change it stop selfpitying yourself change yourself if youre not happy or think you dont have any emotions left you dont understand i cant i dont have the power youre wrong you have enough energy to selfpity yourself daily so get the fuck out if your life has no worth for yourself you might also just start traveling and try every shit out no matter how risky it is like go bungee jumping whatever at this point you shouldnt be afraid of anything its pointless does it matter since everything is pointless get the fuck out and change something and keep changing and changing until you change yourself in conclusion i dont care if people have their depression and are in therapy ill say my opinion and hit them with that the result a lot of them came months or years later thanking me for waking them up or telling them the truth so no op i wont give people empathy for selfinflicted mental conditions ill beat the shit out of them

LifeProTips,removed,so be careful before you get fucked by a dyke
LifeProTips,removed,its so fun not living in a ghetto
LifeProTips,removed,yeah you can find out where they live
LifeProTips,removed,every day
LifeProTips,removed,no one ever thought keep the receipt
LifeProTips,removed,applicant tracking systems suck at reading pdfs its a picture to them you will go into the system but we wont be able to get you back out or find you later you will literally only be considered the one time the recruiter sees your resume after that good luck getting found
LifeProTips,removed,so use a txt and you dont have to buy anything to save as a doc there is a ton of free software that will save in that format just like you dont have to have adobe to save as a pdf you dont have to have microsoft office to save as a doc anything but a pdf and realize that youre talking to a recruiter from a fortune you dont want to work here cool move along and keep rocking the pdf
LifeProTips,removed,anything but a pdf txt any of the doc formats anything that doesnt flatten and lock the document to make the computer read it as not a text document someday recruiting software and systems will catch up to the rest of the world but not anytime soon
LifeProTips,removed,im telling you from experience i had a candidate i hired recently who had applied times to my company found her out on the job boards i always check the internal ats before looking elsewhere couldnt find her pdf ive seen it over and over and over across dozens of platforms im not saying it makes sense im just telling you the reality s
LifeProTips,removed,im a corporate recruiter at a fortune im telling you this because of the way the atss work
LifeProTips,removed,good luck to you then i hope you are successful with flipping from start up to start up once you get past the start up stage youll have an ats to battle
LifeProTips,removed,its the reality of what is out there available to companies once you get into peoplesoft taleo brassring and have something that is large enough to deal with more than a few hundred candidates you lose the ability to search within a pdf dont blame the company blame the technology available and the key players in the industry it is what it is a fortune isnt in a position to just create their own system from scratch they are generally regulated by the ofccp in one way or another and there are only a certain number of systems they can use im just trying to tell people how to get hired you can be upset about it all you wait sometimes it just is what it is
LifeProTips,removed,not if you have a good recruiter they wont if youre using a staffing company sure but its not because anyone wants it to be editable its because we want to be able to find people in the systems later
LifeProTips,removed,where a docx file will say this is a paragraph and this is its contents a pdf file might say this letter goes here and that letter goes there and making them notoriously difficult to parse exactly
LifeProTips,removed,and im against reformatting even if you know your client control your client and inform them i was citing it because atss suck at reading pdfs and candidates end up in black holes that way
LifeProTips,removed,got the same question over and over
LifeProTips,removed,got the same question over and over
LifeProTips,removed,got the same question over and over
LifeProTips,removed,its not the company its the software thats available to handle anything over a few hundred applicants
LifeProTips,removed,a pdf is a nightmare to try to get back out of the system even if i remember that i had a candidate months ago with that one niche skill and theres a word that stood out that i know will bring me right to their resume of the time i am not going to be able to find them
LifeProTips,removed,because you can generally only upload one format make your doc file not look like shit
LifeProTips,removed,name one
LifeProTips,removed,name a platform that can support million applicants a year that will parse a pdf
LifeProTips,removed,keep on with that theory blame the company not the available platforms to manage applications
LifeProTips,removed,youre using a crap staffing company find another one source before i was a corporate recruiter for a fortune i was an agency recruiter theyll take out contact info so you cant cut them out of the process but thats just as easy to do pdf or not i can remove the contact info from any pdf i can go in and edit it if i want to its not hard if i wanted to jack up someones resume not a problem the real issue is that you cant search them within the existing recruiting platforms that are available to the industry but seriously find another staffing company
LifeProTips,removed,name one find one brassring cant taleo cant peoplesoft cant find a platform that can handle million applications a year that can parse and search within a pdf
LifeProTips,removed,i know it stinks but its just what it is and how to get around the black hole that is software recruiters have to use
LifeProTips,removed,a candidate needs to be presented in the way they will present its not up to the staffing company to filter to the clients preference all that is is false advertising if the candidate had a ridiculously laid out resume but is qualified for the job but will drive the client crazy because they choose to use a green font color better to know in the beginning this is part of educating the client and being a talent advisor not just someone who can find resumes and candidates to fwd its a partnership and if a recruiter cant handle their client and let them know that they are merely an order taker
LifeProTips,removed,name one name one ats that can handle and parse from more than a few hundred reliably
LifeProTips,removed,about of the resumes in our system i can access want to be part of the that get sucked into a black hole of the recruiting software keep using pdf i dont make the rules and i get that youre going to take it out on me for telling you this but thats how it works want a better shot at getting hired or getting found again use anything but a pdf
LifeProTips,removed,i would be awesome i have one of the coolest jobs in the world i get to call people and say how do you think the interview went really well theyd like to make you an offer its like being a game show host most days and you can now buy a new car if you have an internal recruiter talk to them and let them know youd like to see the original resume minus the contact info of course and have them fight the staffing company i would rather a hiring manager know that applicant x has a bizarre need to use a green font color for everything right off the bat sometimes those initial layouts are very telling
LifeProTips,removed,a few hundred applicants as i said find me something that can handle a large volume and this isnt an ats the lens api can be easily integrated into your applicant tracking system try matching it up with some of the big players been down that road taleo cant brassring cant peoplesoft cant talk to me about something that can handle applications a year
LifeProTips,removed,why when i have another people who did submit a doc and i can find them we are talking volume here and how do i explain to someone levels above me that we need to invest the time or resources into converting pdfs for people when the largest ats programs dont bother its going to be a waste the answer will be they will just need to apply again
LifeProTips,removed,its not that i cant read them genius its that once someone puts it in the ats its not going to be searchable listen im trying to tell people how not to be stuck in the black hole that you throw your resume into want to stick with pdf go for it
LifeProTips,removed,i dont know why youre trying to attack me when im telling you how the current systems work im trying to help you people and all you want to do is argue about how it should be something that i can do it doesnt work that way if you want to use a pdf resume go for it be my guest im trying to give you insider information about how recruiting systems work at of the companies will read your resume a pdf wont parse and it wont be searchable either learn from the information or not
LifeProTips,removed,i was trying to help people understand and improve their odds but apparently this is going to be attack the recruiter because she talked about what really happens when you throw your resume into that black hole im done with this keep using your pdf thats fine i dont care
LifeProTips,removed,i was trying to help people understand and improve their odds but apparently this is going to be attack the recruiter because she talked about what really happens when you throw your resume into that black hole im done with this keep using your pdf thats fine i dont care
LifeProTips,removed,i was trying to help people understand and improve their odds but apparently this is going to be attack the recruiter because she talked about what really happens when you throw your resume into that black hole im done with this keep using your pdf thats fine i dont care i dont have a problem filling jobs im glad that was your assumption and you want to jump on me and insult me youre awesome no wonder people hate recruiters do you treat your candidates like this
LifeProTips,removed,and recruiters can read its the information in the resume you want us to read right we can read we do read if you want us to read it again or find it again dont use a format thats incompatible with of the applicant tracking systems out there
LifeProTips,removed,want to come work for a company that processes over million applications a year and doesnt need to worry about their next hire because the candidate pool is full im not agency anymore hun all im trying to do is inform the ignorant about applicant tracking systems now toddle off and go rewrite someones resume for them
LifeProTips,removed,yep works just fine as awful as it is to say you can save that sucker as a txt and have better results than a pdf
LifeProTips,removed,so do i its just what it is and people need to know it pisses me off as much as everyone who has attacked me since i opened my mouth and shared this
LifeProTips,removed,i mean you even used the phrase increase their odds its not a slot machine the reality is i get applications to every position in less than hours ever see a posting and then go back and find out its closed its because the recruiter got crushed by applications we might find the perfect candidate out there and open it back up for an hour so our selected candidate can apply but its reality i agree its bullshit but the sheer volume of applications to every position is also bullshit do you know how many resumes i read that arent even close to a fit i have posted positions for attorneys who needed union negotiation experience and have had hairdressers apply that quick apply on careerbuilder option is the bane of my existence i will take a badly formatted resume that matches the qualifications any day over a crap application i will also want to reach out to that one person who had that unique combination of skills but i cant find them because of the limitations of applicant tracking system software and will be equally as frustrated this isnt a you the job seeker against me the recruiter thing im trying to help stop being pissed at me for telling you how the systems work i cant control how atss work im just telling you how they do and how to improve your chances want to take the advice fine want to attack me fine im just telling you how it works
LifeProTips,removed,depends on your background and what you want to do the company i work for is a fortune so probably
LifeProTips,removed,i can view it genius i just cant search it and get the information back out of the applicant tracking system once you apply i can call you today have a great conversation and months from now when your dream job opens up i cant find you why because the ats cant search pdfs you can be pissed at me for telling you how the systems work you can belittle the company i work for because we use an applicant tracking system you can think its a you against me situation and you can think im a moron thats fine if you would have read the other comments where people have jumped down my throat you would understand im sharing this information to try to help you i am just as pissed at the limitations as you are you can keep using a pdf and take your chances or you can listen to someone trying to help you your choice
LifeProTips,removed,recruiters dont get to control the systems ok stay with your current plan heres the deal im trying to help people understand the current situation if you want to keep using pdf go for it dont get mad at recruiters when you throw your resume into a black hole im trying to help and am actually getting really sick of being jumped on for trying to help you understand how and why you arent being actively recruited if you want to keep your pdf format fine if you dont want to take free advice fine good luck to you
LifeProTips,removed,there isnt a platform that can parse pdfs on a large scale scroll through the rest of the comments there is actually an it who explains this
LifeProTips,removed,thats fine
LifeProTips,removed,yeah try applying for a position with something other than a pdf youll be in the system and a recruiter will be able to find you that way

LifeProTips,removed,funny story i had an attorney i talked to who had themes to his resume every massive project he supported was titled like a movie saving xxx from the dark he was an international attorney who had some crazy skills at negotiating property transactions and long story short you bet i remembered someone who had themes to his resume who had negotiated the restructuring of a national power grid with a bunch of pissed off home owners who were all going to lose a little land here and a little land there amazing candidate who ended up with an amazing job there is always something that stands out that id like to be able to search if only people will listen s

LifeProTips,removed,depends on the company and the location i recruit in the us my current position doesnt sponsor so it will eliminate applicants ive worked for clients who didnt have that restriction and it didnt there is generally an automated email you will get from an ats after you applied its not always just a confirmation read it it will tell you most of the time if you were taken out of consideration because of your location or your work status ive hired both ways thats too company specific to be able to give you a hard and fast answer on where are you where are you trying to go you can also hit raskhr and include the country you are in and where you are trying to move to you might get a recruiter from that company to answer

LifeProTips,removed,bring a copy of your resume to the interview problem solved
LifeProTips,removed,recruiters dont care about a new hire working out or not hiring manager picks the candidate my job i to put a butt in the seat
LifeProTips,removed,no because then youre done put your actual experience on your resume and apply for jobs you qualify for
LifeProTips,removed,we do find them thats why we blow through your resume we go find the candidates while you try to seo your resume recruiters dont just process applications ya know we actively go look for people who are the right fit
LifeProTips,removed,and here ladies and gentlemen is a recruiter how do i know instantly boolean search and cold call welcome to the chaos my friend
LifeProTips,removed,and that one candidate with that one skill i talked to months ago that i want to find i cant i just realized where your brain left this conversation its not that i didnt hire someone in months its that i need to find the purple squirrel i talked to months ago please read comprehend or just process applicants its up to you if youve never thought i know that candidate i know who you need to hire his name was damn what was his name you arent a real recruiter youre an order taker and a processor
LifeProTips,removed,thats only staffing companies im a corporate recruiter for a fortune and pdfs suck in my system i cant search them please see about of my last replies
LifeProTips,removed,or just be a good parent and think about your child
LifeProTips,removed,we leave them in the black hole of the system thats why im telling people to stop with the pdfs no one has time to have this conversation over and over and argue with people over formats you can listen and learn or you can end up in a black hole im just trying to get the information out there you can argue you can be pissed it is what it is i cant fix it im just sharing what i know
LifeProTips,removed,its pretty easy its a quick little google search what you dont understand about recruiters we are professional internet stalkers we will find out pretty quickly we also will have some challenge questions to ask you remember that last phone interview where someone asked you something and you thought oh shit um lets try this answer that was a check question we can smell bullshit a mile away oh and that little trick of uploading different resumes on different job boards that isnt helping
LifeProTips,removed,make sure you are clicking no on the ads and you will be fine dont fill out anything when those popups show up there is an opt out on all of those ads yes careerbuilder im giving away more secrets now
LifeProTips,removed,put your phone number on your resume and try careerbuilder and indeed if anyone calls you and says my manager saw your resume and would like to set a time for an interview ask are you selling insurance if they say yes and you dont want to do that tell them no and hang up lots of selling insurance spam not much you can do to fix that
LifeProTips,removed,careerbuilder in the us
LifeProTips,removed,always format in doc yes never format in doc doc is the standard that everyone can take always use a chronological resume never use a chronological resume depends on the level and what you are looking to do if you have a large gap in employment are looking to change careers or are looking to otherwise deviate from your career path use a functional resume always tailor your resume to each job submission never tailor your resume to each job submission look for the key words if you were not titled as a project manager but did that work and are applying for a project management position put it in there somewhere recruiters are pretty good at reading between the lines but if you had some goofy title that was unique to your last employer dumb it down for us let us help you by being able to find you always find one good recruiter and work with them never use just one recruiter i would say to work with multiple recruiters this isnt a marriage you can be polyamorous when looking for a job dont apply to the same job with agencies though that gets into an ugly way you dont want to be a part of always put your education on your resume never put your education on your resume depends on if its relevant to what youre doing i never put grad year on my resume but thats because im old i generally dont put my degree on my resume because it has nothing to do with hrrecruiting if you have a degree and want to list it put it on there drop the year you graduated and make sure its not in underwater basket weaving when youre applying for a cfo position its a bs degree just a bs not a bs in underwater basket weaving if youre over the age of you dont have to worry about a degree keep listing experience and go with that hope this helps
LifeProTips,removed,rcirclejerk might be a good place for you
LifeProTips,removed,that is the weirdest reply so far congrats man good luck passing the drug test
LifeProTips,removed,cant handle the volume and its not an ats it is a stand alone that can be integrated into an ats unless you are using one of the large providers like taleo brassring peoplesoft
LifeProTips,removed,it happens you can report them to careerbuilder by emailing toscareerbuildercom unfortunately that does come with the territory any legit recruiter will leave you a voicemail when they call send unknown or unfamiliar calls to vm then you can see who to call back
LifeProTips,removed,you keep posting this you apparently have no experience in a large company or with anyone other than them id personally like to use entelo and have them integrate but that doesnt work either
LifeProTips,removed,arguments fights hundreds of emails a day and people stalking you yes for all of you still looking at this thread we know when you call us we have caller id dont think calling us times back to back is going to get you any favors its going to piss us off we are trying to do our jobs too sigh most days i love my job some days i hate it i try to help people and then this happens thanks for being in my corner
LifeProTips,removed,youll have to have to have the ability to support resumes a year and make sure its accurate and affordable if you can develop something that can support applications a second and still beat taleo peoplesoft and brassring while providing ofccp compliant reporting tools that will integrate with about different hr analytics programs sure
LifeProTips,removed,im saying for an ats if you want to screw the staffing companies be my guest if you apply for a company directly use a doc
LifeProTips,removed,your personal website leave it this is ats advice only if you are applying to a company it needs to be anything but a pdf
LifeProTips,removed,keep reading ive been explaining this for horus
LifeProTips,removed,based off a resume that says i have great attention to detail dont put that crap on a resume thats nonsense and no one cares everyone says they have great attention to detail
LifeProTips,removed,probably not im just replying as people reply and attack let me guess i told you the same thing twice keep going with your pdf format im done with you
LifeProTips,removed,you can read them but can you search and how large of a company do you work for
LifeProTips,removed,he was submitting you directly and submitted you to the job he called you about pdf is fine if you dont care about finding the candidate later
LifeProTips,removed,skip those theyre processing mills theyll also call from florida dont know why i get those calls too

LifeProTips,removed,heres another lpt to add to this if you have to put your left shoe on the car floor to remember to get your child out dont have children because you are a fucking moron
LifeProTips,removed,they all will take it its the ability for them to search it later thats the issue you apply and ill see it once can i find it again probably not listen im trying help and inform people ive worked the agency side and right now i work in corporate recruiting i cant fix the issue and im just as frustrated as you are but i cant fix it dont blame me either follow the advice or dont frankly i dont care at this point
LifeProTips,removed,and if theyd also all stop naming their resume resume that would be super as well lookie i found a recruiter thanks for saying this
LifeProTips,removed,usually something like that happens in the initial beq basic eligibility question phase its not a change in their resume it is when you are asked do you have this this and this and you just check yes and are passed though i doubt that his resume was changed he answered the application questions if he said yes they believed him
LifeProTips,removed,careerbuilder monster make sure you have a linkedin profile doostang indeed what do you do what did you get your degree in there are hundreds of job boards out there many are specific if youre in it dice also make sure your social media profiles say who you are and what you do believe it or not ive hacked peoples gethub accounts to get their personal email before when i needed a purple squirrel
LifeProTips,removed,the agency cant do it either ive been on both sides i appreciate you understanding the wave of crap im getting for saying this and my frustration if we as recruiters could fix it on either side agency or direct hire we would we arent really all that different we all want to get people jobs we all know the systems suck we have to deal with them every day and it pisses us off too
LifeProTips,removed,it is what it is listen im trying help and inform people ive worked the agency side and right now i work in corporate recruiting i cant fix the issue and im just as frustrated as you are but i cant fix it dont blame me either follow the advice or dont frankly i dont care at this point
LifeProTips,removed,so youre doing entry level temp placement work there are a ton of other models direct hire temp to hire limited contract corporate recruiters exec recruiting
LifeProTips,removed,get used to it in about years you will start playing drinking games in the office the next person who gets a resume that contains in the objective statement to contribute to a company has to buy the next bottle of tequila welcome to the industry and take notes you will have some hilarious stories to tell in a year or so
LifeProTips,removed,im so buried in mail at this point it isnt going to matter and even when i link the reply people still argue either someone will listen at this point or they wont i am appreciating those who are reaching out saying that it did help and they did learn something welcome to reddit where some will some wont
LifeProTips,removed,and it infuriates recruiters as well do you want to have someone with a searchable doc in the system who was the close that i can find again when you hire again in months or do you want someone to submit a pdf that ill never be able to pull back out
LifeProTips,removed,ill take a txt lol the worst was one that no shit uploaded a resume as an excel doc it was the most bizarre thing i have opened to date they seriously typed a word per cell strange to read hillarious to share maybe i need to add that to this string no pdf and no xls
LifeProTips,removed,there isnt anyone in the fortune who can parse them so im ok with that and im usually looking for the candidates the ones that fall into the black hole i cant help listen im trying help and inform people ive worked the agency side and right now i work in corporate recruiting i cant fix the issue and im just as frustrated as you are but i cant fix it dont blame me either follow the advice or dont frankly i dont care at this point
LifeProTips,removed,there are a couple the us army used a system that was called ariss it was dos based i think all of them out there have their definite issues applicants think recruiters suck recruiters try to help applicants and they tell us the software sucks we agree they still tell us we suck at our jobs welcome to recruiting
LifeProTips,removed,its worse dont use a pdf ever and make sure you fill our your ksas if you have to retype or copy and paste the system couldnt read it with the usajobs site there are often ksas to submit have you been doing those doc helps as well i recruited for the army for a bit and we actually had a dos based atsbelieve it or not and that wasnt that long ago post dumb it down for the system
LifeProTips,removed,cant tell you and i dont care if you hate the plat form im telling you what to do to work around it if youre a selftaught neurosurgeon with a gpa and want to call me a cunt i cant help you see i can read i just wont be able to find your application again i will remember you in the future and will make sure youre black listed from hiring because you called me a cunt and that is a button i have available can i search a pdf nope can i put notes into your application and associate your name and identifiers with your comment yes can i point out your references are sick bro sure see how that works good luck to you
LifeProTips,removed,thanks i appreciate that i just want people to know why their resume ends up in the black hole and how to avoid it youd think save as would be a simple suggestion and not an all out war where ive been called everything from a cunt to an asshole to a bigot
LifeProTips,removed,is that per client per line of business times major sectors it needs to be able to be live and capable of handling somewhere around applications per second for just the company i work for and if it cant read the pdfs accurately then its no better than taleo brassring peoplesoft youre looking to control dam burst with a garden hose thats why the leaders in the industry dont fix the issue all of the systems handle the inital application perfectly i can read the pdf when they apply i just cant go back in months later and find it because they had the word thunderchicken in their resume and i remember that because they would be perfect for the new opening probably of our resumes come in as compatible formats when youre talking about millions of applications a year if i lose of them from a business standpoint and there is a job that they maybe out of people who apply and i need to reach out and tell them to apply because they are perfect and i can save a few bucks by not dealing with pdfs which suck to parse and i can still get a qualified candidate in the seat why would i i will tell you from over a decade of recruiting that i have never not filled a job because someone applied with a pdf months ago i know theyre perfect but i cant remember their name and cant find them and this would be their dream job but i didnt have someone else who i could hire who is equally qualified who applied with a pdf that i could read once would it be awesome yes would it help of course do we miss out on talent absolutely in the grand scheme of things the players in the market are really cheap to leverage thats going to be the issue i can go and talk to people and actively recruit them they are perfect for the position i tell them the job posting will go up on thursday for an hour and they need to look for job i will have people apply in that hour then i have to sift through and make sure im compliant and within rules and then i can move forward if you want to build an hris you need a hr partner to tell you how many ways you can get sued in the process and the reporting that will have to come out of it and how many ways you need to document a turn down youre looking for a niche but this is far from just a database and a tracking system youre looking to tackle if you really have had experience in financial services send me a pm
LifeProTips,removed,i dont support nyc but i always have connections what are you looking for whats your background
LifeProTips,removed,i suppose i should just be thankful that i dont apply to shit tier jobs like the ones you hire for well thats a back handed compliment i guess my last job offer on friday afternoon was a starting salary of with a bonus
LifeProTips,removed,that will work fine its a txt file with spiffier formatting
LifeProTips,removed,if i could figure out not to show her information i would it is horrendous ive also had people send me their pay day loan documents instead of their resume hang in there youll see some crazy shit in recruiting

LifeProTips,removed,i cant help much with education ive done just about everything but that teachers unions are a mess to negotiate with this is something that that industry would need and the volume wouldnt be crazy youd need some good filters at the front end before you invested a lot into parsing pdfs
LifeProTips,removed,i wish it was in over a decade of recruiting i had never had someone submit one as an excel doc i have one saved where someone swears in his resume he made me make a new rule if you swear in your resume you have to spell it correctly i never thought id beat that one until i got the excel resume once of the swear guys resume he didnt like no jokky muthafuckas it was hilarious still is
LifeProTips,removed,im just a recruiter with lists of stuff we really do work and dont just throw resumes in the bin lol start small not all are going to apply to you but its a start deep breaths really linkedin is the go to for head hunters make sure you have a picture and you have a personality and you are just you talk post dont worry about how long it is there isnt a tldr on linkedin no one prints it hang in there and apply apply apply with anything other than a pdf
LifeProTips,removed,pdfs dont work in the majority of the applicant tracking systems on the market thats they recruiters want them even when dealing with a company directly there is an ats and recruiter
LifeProTips,removed,recruiters suggest you put them as doc so they can find you later formatting it as a pdf and applying will pretty much guarantee your resume ends up in a black hole we will see it once and then it goes away never to be seen again
LifeProTips,removed,id think you were calling me a thunder cunt and you were a selftaught neurosurgeon with a crap gpa sick bro welcome to being black listed with my company bye bye
LifeProTips,removed,it takes hours they all blend together after a while im a recruiter too im trying to give you a oh crap i have to read this tomorrow moment be nice dont attack i know the pain objective to secure a position within an organization where i can add to the growth of the company by leveraging my punctuality experience and the fact that im a detale note the misspelling oriented individual objective to leverage
LifeProTips,removed,if a recruiter is using a program that doesnt do that then they need to update their software if you can find an ats that can scan pdfs large scale none of this nonsense about a few hundred at a time im talking per second to accommodate millions a year im all ears oh and make it affordable and then make it a market leader and beat out taleo peoplesoft and brassring
LifeProTips,removed,they all do unless you tell them not to unless you say no sit stay there is a format rule they apply in word that makes them all look the same
LifeProTips,removed,start applying about months out the hiring process is a total and complete sstorm for new grads start early
LifeProTips,removed,you probably need to work with a career coach and work on your selfesteem if i ask for something from you its because i need you to help me out while i am working for you if you think they asked for it just so they can edit it you under estimate their skills recruiters are professional internet stalkers we know how to google if you were an idiot i would have sent why waste the time to ask for it in another format you were presented as a candidate did you ever follow up with the recruiter
LifeProTips,removed,i dont have a pm from you i dont think im burried at the moment but put picard in the message and we shall chat
LifeProTips,removed,at this point im being attacked from so many directions its completely possible ive been called a bigot and an asshole and a cunt and im honestly just trying to let people know how to work around the black hole which is the reality of applicant tracking systems that exist for the majority of positions out there ive been called an asshole lazy incompetent a racist a cunt a bitch and stupid i honestly want to just clear out the replies right now and forget i shared this at this point people who want to send a pdf to an ats they can go for it i honestly dont care anymore
LifeProTips,removed,it always weirdly coincided with recruiters who said oh you sent me your resume in pdfi got it off your website in pdf can i get it in doc im going to preface this by saying im buried in messages i dont know how this is condescending this is probably a recruiter who couldnt say my system screws up pdf resumes can you send it in a doc recruiters can be idiots occasionally and wont say why and think they need to put up a front i just say my system is going to chew up your resume and the only version i have is in a pdf can you send me a doc format so i can attach it to your application
LifeProTips,removed,does hr software give more weight to people with cover letters no its a separate click do recruiters actually read cover letters when qualifying unless its hilariously bad no they all say youre a punctual detailed oriented individual who is looking to work their way up through a company and you want to add your experience to an environment where you will thrive from the date a job is posted whats the average amount of time it takes to hire someone depends on the company ive screened and hired someone in days and ive called someone who applies months ago it really depends there isnt an expiration date on an application if you dont apply with a pdf i may call you years from now because my system could read your resume and you are the secret squirrel im looking for and ill call you because you applied to the position you werent qualified for at the time but i have cooler job now that youre perfect for
LifeProTips,removed,and now you see the day to day of a recruiter im obviously an asshole because im buried in messages and you give me no context and you just want to swear at me so let me take a moment so youve been a redditor for years you have less karma than ive earned today your top comment is too bad he didnt die up there i bet the chinese officials wouldnt have even gone looking for him edit words sorry im not going to reply to you anymore good luck with your job search
LifeProTips,removed,and thats when you go back the recruiter and let himher smack them around d we all deal with assholes recruiters are pretty good at either proving their worth or being lap dogs you can find it out quickly if there is a format issue lets play out scenarios dedicated i had feedback from the group and the interview went great my system sucks and i need a doc version of your resume had i not called you the format might have been eaten by the system but thats a story for another day can you send me a copy of your resume in a doc format or decicated the hiring managers are kinda ocd i need to reformat your resume so they have the whole thing in wingding font can you send that to me this is what recruiters do im sorry you didnt have the babysitter in the middle the last time you interviewed it should be at worst a combination of stupid and nonsense not just stupid
LifeProTips,removed,i love my job and i will fight for you when i can sometimes the hiring manager thats not a job btw thats the person who the applicant will work for its the boss of the new hire is just an ass and recruiting cant help them understand common sense we do try and we do care and dont cross companies off the list try again try to interview with someone else
LifeProTips,removed,thats a soft skill you dont have to put it in your resume you just need to not use yo in your email reply yo attention to detail means you are professional when need be and can beatbox on the street when need be yo
LifeProTips,removed,does it really matter though when i have to type all that information into text boxes on the website right after i upload my resume that means you uploaded your resume in a format the ats didnt understand you probably used a pdf and not a doc the computer doesnt understand what you sent in this is a huge red flag that youre using the wrong format to apply and youre being sucked into a black hole cut and paste and you might save yourself or be angry that the system didnt parse correctly and get mad at the recruiter and decide you dont want to work there because you cant copy and paste for minutes your choice
LifeProTips,removed,would your software even pick it up you would not see it if your resume scraping software didnt seeing that is was in a comment ie ignored by any pdf viewer — unless you regularly open pdfs in vi or some other text editor a very low risk im willing to take i open applications and attachments from those who apply if you applied for one of my positions id highlight your comment and youd be done this little play of i would not call you a thunder cunt nor a thunder cuuuunt i simply dont hold you in high enough esteem to share my glorious and beautiful name with you this means youre done you would have entered in enough information to try to set someone up and you dont understand that my company is recognized by hrc you are looking to troll and im not going to do this with you you have been insulting and inflammatory and all ive tried to do is inform and educate i hope you are proud you tried to troll a fortune recruiter who actually focuses on diversity recruiting and knows what hrc is and you are deliberately trying to be ridiculous do you have something else to add or is meepmeep the most intelegent thing you can add as a sheep
LifeProTips,removed,fortune companies lack the very basic ability to scrape pdf files they dont all create their own applicant tracking system they use what is available ive had this conversation over and over look up brassring taleo and peoplesoft to start
LifeProTips,removed,if they have more than employees send a doc or txt and i was reminded about rtf tonight make it easily searchable you are trying to seo your resume in their ats pretend its google with less rules the rule is doc format follow the rules
LifeProTips,removed,i have direct evidence from personal experience that software exists that is capable of pulling correct relevant information from my pdf resume recognizing the schools i went to the companies i worked for the skills i have etc i know this because it then fills in the appropriate fields which incidentally makes it searchable for later ive seen this work with multiple services im glad for you you had an ideal experience find a platform that can do that with several million applications a year and then make it work do it you could make millions youre not an expert youre a job seeker who is pissed i gotcha im a recruiter who is frustrated too linkedin doesnt send applicant data as a pdf indeed doesnt send applicant data as a pdf hopefully the industry comes to its senses and standardizes the whole process but until then we have this mess to deal with they have and ive shared that save it as a doc
LifeProTips,removed,yes it is and has been for over a decade fix it and make it affordable and competitive ill be your huckleberry for free if you loop me in ive ben banging my head up against a wall for too many years it should be a simple fix but no one does it need white papers on why this would help i wrote them need information on how this would help diversity recruiting did those studies need a recruiter who has begged and pleaded let me be your poster child and consultant and salesman

LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah thats pretty much how it goes as youve been told compartmentalize things dont try to visualize or fix all your problems at once and thats hard to do when someone has just told you not to realize that everyone you meet has gone through the same level of shit at one point or another and they are still holding it together so so can you
LifeProTips,not_removed,in a month i would kill to make that in a year what does op do for a living
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you start to feel overwhelmed by your life do two things look at a clock your watch your phone for the time set a timer if you need to for five minutes breathe deeply stand up straight with your shoulders pushed back gently fill your lungs completely put a hand just underneath your breastbone and feel your chest move out this is filling your lungs completely if you have a quiet moment hold your breath and count slowly to three exhale slowly and fill your lungs again repeat if you are trying to accomplish other tasks that you cannot take a pause from then simply devote a small part of your attention to breathing deeply like this five minutes have passed and you are still breathing maybe you even got something done no matter how small remind yourself that your hardships are temporary and you will get through them remind yourself that your life will have its share of happy and sad times and you are building your strength for future sad times tell yourself you are doing your best and you are still learning as are all of the people around you and which is all you or anyone else can expect of you you are going to be okay
LifeProTips,not_removed,break it down and deal with the pieces unfortunately there is no formula for it its a common situation and a lot of people go through it the trick is to not stop trying to sort the pieces out sometimes it will seem to not get any better but if you stopped addressing individual issues it could get a whole lot worse just keep going its what makes adults out of kids this is where your story comes from
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive been in almost the same situation granted mine was a little different i was at the time ive been just out of a year and a bit long relationship where i thought i was going to marry someone this led to supreme sadness which made me not graduate when i had a year left of schooling had about three grand in medical bills due to a bicycle accident and was in mad relations with parents so i had to be selfsufficient just remember that your family is always there to help you one thing that i noticed that helped me is doing hobbies that i genuinely enjoy cycling running and science was my things so i kept at it i kept at my job since that made me do stuff and keep organized but one thing for sure if things seem to be overwhelming dont be afraid to reduce your responsibilities i had to fall into a pit to figure that out and your boss is right do one thing at a time and just remember that there are always people in similar situations that have turned out alright im sure your parents have faced similar situations ive faced similar situations youre facing similar situations just keep at it and it will get better as long as you put the effort to make yourself better trust me im finishing my degree at purdue with two minors in a very technical field have a solid career pathway lined up with another major backup as well so just keep facing the sun that way the shadow is behind you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just turned and my husband and i have both lost our jobs leading to us haveing to sell our house when we sold it we moved into my parents basement where my grandfather is also living each month we have the following bills to pay cell phones gas my student loan his truck payment year ago i was looking at marrying my husband and beginning our family in our home i was making plans for what school my kids would go to in the city we lived in i was thinking about starting a baby sitting home so that i could be a stay at home mother when i got pregnant we were making plans to save up and buy me a new vehicle because mine is old and has issues life constantly changes the best you can do is remember that when the worst happens you always have someplace to crash usually family and that people who love you will help when you ask
LifeProTips,not_removed,waiting solves over of all problems the other you gotta recognize and do something about life ends horribly for almost everyone just accept it
LifeProTips,not_removed,your post reminded me of a rgetmotivated post from yesterday the gist that i think applies at any age is also a good paraphrase from a similarly pithy facebook post this too will pass it may pass like a kidney stone but it will pass prepare as best you can for your job exam and take full advantage of your parents kindness and spend more nights on their couch than you do in your car talk to those you owe the medical debt to and tell them you will work out a payment arrangement once you know the outcome of your job exam
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love your response i agree when times get hard you gotta do your very best eventually your successes will over come your problems and youll appreciate what you over come i would like to add make sure you make the best decision of yourself not an emotional decision when it comes to your future stability a sibling of my was in heavy debt and was finally seeing light he then felt that he deserved to reward himself for the progress made and bought a used expensive car he could barely afford the car is junk and hes back to square one
LifeProTips,not_removed,starting a month from now op will start making a salary of per year
LifeProTips,not_removed,in a month i will make a year not a month though that would be awesome i work for a small family owned business handling heavy equipment trucking claims
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre getting sarcastic or disrespectful comments from your professional boss at work then the way you say something might not be the problem
LifeProTips,not_removed,hmmmthis is a passive approach always depends on the situation but honesty and being direct matter and if all else fails blame tibor
LifeProTips,not_removed,wordy words i always say that i dont make excuses i provide justifications language is funny
LifeProTips,not_removed,my understanding was you thought you knew how the hell to do a good impression
LifeProTips,not_removed,always use big words and complex sentences when describing why you failed to accomplish something it works of the time i have personal experience

LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt if you habitually read reddit she probably doesnt like you either
LifeProTips,not_removed,false in several cases i found out later that she did
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always wondered if mom liked me now i know she doesnt thanks op
LifeProTips,not_removed,not really a lpt because its generalisation on outcomes upon finding out if she likes you or not op has likely had a bad run lpt to find out if a girllady likes you she may gaze at you more when you are speaking or does she quickly look away when you look in her direction as though she had been staring at you woman can find it just as awkward to approach a man there may be signs of nervousness or an occasional flirt

LifeProTips,not_removed,my ex wife had it it was my first time dealing with it first person needless to say i ruined everything if i could go back in time in any case there should be some kind of warning system facial expressions may not represent actual emotions
LifeProTips,not_removed,its a sad sign of the times when common courtesy becomes a lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont tell people what is right and what is wrong some people cant talk some have difficulty hearing and are anxious about speaking dont do nice things for people for the expectation of recognition or applause do it because it is what you think is the right thing to do and let others find their own right
LifeProTips,not_removed,why not say thank you dont be an asshole
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am one of those people that if someone doesnt say thank you after i do a nice gesture i make a point of saying rather loudly no worries or youre welcome
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like to smile too
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like to hold the door open and i think its thoughtful when a man of any age but the elderly especially offers to hold it instead so i can in

LifeProTips,not_removed,youre right but if youre one of those people with no common courtesy then theres no hope for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,some poeple dont even make eye contact
LifeProTips,not_removed,i say thank you frequently and in these instances but my response wasnt about my social etiquette it was about selfidh motive behind kind actionif u wanted to help someone the satisfaction is derived from helping someone not the thanks the theres no hope for you is a bit of a hyperbole long as you are alive there is hope it seems to me your acts of common courtesy are motivated less by some wholesome altruism but more by a desire to have those traits praised
LifeProTips,not_removed,should they
LifeProTips,not_removed,as you say in these instances you also say thankyou its a nice gesture when someone shows kind actions its proper etiquette to do the same i dont believe anyone can say otherwise its just opening a door i dont get off on it when someone acknowledges what i do but i do acknowledge when someone is to be so unaware of these kind gestures maybe its just how i was raised thank you is undoubtedly nicer than saying nothing
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you dont i just assume your socially awkward
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you just assume my socially awkward
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,your socially awkward what
LifeProTips,not_removed,worth a shot i see what you did there
LifeProTips,not_removed,probably not worth the time for people who arent already inclined to volunteer but the shots are usually mandatory to volunteer at hospitals
LifeProTips,not_removed,or be a canadian
LifeProTips,not_removed,while im a huge supporter of guns own several and keep one ready for home defense should i ever need it i will disagree for the sole reason that some people shouldnt be using guns nor should it be forced on people who dont want it if youre not responsible enough to competently use a firearm i dont want you having one if youd rather rely on police to come save you thats also your choice if you want to defend yourself are trained and responsible and willing to accept the consequences that can come if things go wrong then you should have the right to defend your life with a firearm
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think i am gonna pass on this lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,in actuality though how often does this happen dont get me wrong i couldnt care less about who has guns and who doesnt but how often has a situation been improved because somebody had a gun i cant imagine having a standoff situation in a house with two people who probably arent properly trained in shooting targets would be any better than a single person threatening to shoot innocent civilians
LifeProTips,not_removed,shoot all the things
LifeProTips,not_removed,is a personal decision not one that should be taken lightly and certainly not one that people should be scared in to like your description
LifeProTips,not_removed,hello thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons your post is not considered a lpt a tip that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way if you would like to appeal this decision httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetorlifeprotips do not repost without explicit permission from the moderators make sure you rlifeprotipsaboutsidebar before submitting thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,you have the right regardless even if your government does not recognize or protect that right
LifeProTips,not_removed,it happens more than you would think in certain areas of the us
LifeProTips,not_removed,honestly not very often data from showed only justifiable gunrelated homicides incidents in which authorities ruled that killings occurred in selfdefense that said we cant rule out the possibility that guns in every home wouldnt lower the number of violent crimes and raise the number of justifiable homicides frankly the best that can be done is speculate perhaps a gun in every home would deter criminals perhaps it would merely lead to more crime and more violent crime realistically there will never be a gun in every home and in homes with a gun there is no guarantee that it will solve the problem should one arise there are certainly examples where having a gun can save your life there are plenty of examples where having a gun can cause the situation to go south people myself included choose to arm themselves because we want to have the option available should we need it i dont see my gun as some magic getoutofjailfree card i know theres a risk that trying to use it to save myself will lead to my death i know theres a risk that i could accidentally miss and hit the wrong target i train to lower the risk of accidents i mentally prepare myself to decide when i would pull the trigger so when the moment comes i wont hesitate and lose the opportunity i do all this because i want to have the choice i want to have some control over my destiny should i ever find myself in a shitty situation where my life is threatened its not about statistics of how likely it is to happen to me its about hoping for the best but being prepared for the worst
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes you have the right even if you arent responsible thanks for clarifying
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are that much of a scaredy cat or your hands are shaking from the dts best to just hire a real electrician anyone who has to use a plastic cap to protect themselves doesnt need to be messing with electricity
LifeProTips,not_removed,or go and turn off the breaker thats the real lpt doing your own electrical work turn off the power first
LifeProTips,not_removed,first of all flip the circuit breaker to the circuit that outlet is on second of all get your voltmeter and test both sockets to make sure the powers off if you then want to put a couple of those babyproof things in each socket go right ahead
LifeProTips,not_removed,id actually love to see someone fall uncomfortably while accepting a gift
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if the gift is a giant dead rat from your cat
LifeProTips,not_removed,in eastern cultures it is normal to refuse twice and then you are obliged to accept at the third offer or to constrain
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless youre a cop because bribes
LifeProTips,not_removed,it was my year bday party and my dad gifted me a bike i tried to ride it but i fell on a rock and it was very uncomfortable he asked me to try again but i refused then he insisted once more so i accepted his persistance and attempted to ride the bike again the second time was a great success can confirm ops lifetip is solid advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,how is this manipulation youre getting a gift that was already offered to you im glad you feel better when you go through this process but if you call it manipulation wouldnt you feel bad because youre manipulating someone
LifeProTips,not_removed,we appreciate you demonstrating your value as a member of this community
LifeProTips,not_removed,also politely ask for the receipt so you can return it later
LifeProTips,not_removed,calling rtitlegore whoops
LifeProTips,not_removed,offer them a very surprising distracting gift while youre both walking and trip them with your foot then look disappointed at them for falling while you were trying to gift them something to make sure they feel uncomfortable about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,you have to eat it

LifeProTips,not_removed,you missed the other one
LifeProTips,not_removed,your mind may be a supercomputer but mines more like a ibm
LifeProTips,not_removed,people ought to research when and how to eat fruit too it blows my mind how many people havent eaten a pear in years because they had that one pear straight off the supermarket shelf and was hard and flavorless as all hell
LifeProTips,not_removed,does this lpt also apply to picking humans
LifeProTips,not_removed,people should also try more fruits theyve never tried before the other day i had dragonfruit and lychees both were delicious
LifeProTips,not_removed,im surprised to find out people dont do that
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats crazy an hour ago i was just thinking of telling girlfriend that the box of clementines we had was a good batch very juicy and sweet thanks for the reminder
LifeProTips,not_removed,loading comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre welcome man and heres another
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,speaking as somebody who has performed a couple hundred thousand solder joins in my life i can offer these tips to reduce the shakes dont drink a lot of coffee energy drinks or anything with caffeine before doing this kind of work the less stimulants in your system the better hold your soldering irongun as close to the tip as you can without burning yourself of course the more real estate that is hanging out there the more the tip will shake improvise a brace hard point or anything you can to rest the shaft of the soldering iron or gun before applying the tip to the work doing this will virtually eliminate any possibility of the tip shaking even if your vision is perfect use a magnifier with a builtin light to enlarge the work and make it much easier to apply the tip where it needs to go
LifeProTips,not_removed,leaning against a hard surface with your elbowforearm will stop the shaking and allow for a better precision change the angle at which you go about soldering circuits in order to get the best position to solder correctly and for your hand to be in a stable position also try to be at your best when doing these kind of tasks such as sufficient sleep and not after a lot of caffeine intake you will get better at it with practice and wish you the best of luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,avoid caffeine and refined sugar and lean your elbow or forearm against something nearby to provide stability
LifeProTips,not_removed,cardio and beta blockers also works if youre a competitive shooter
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you can lay the hand holding the iron down and rock it to the target kind of like using a rest to shoot you hand cant jiggle much if it is on a table or whatever
LifeProTips,not_removed,great advice only things i would add are eat well if you are hungry you will get shaky get enough sleep
LifeProTips,not_removed,can attest to all of this advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,can you illustrate the brace example
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes sleep is definitely the best tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,any surface or item that wont move around really for example on some tv chassis i clamped an old metal ruler to the chassis to create a hard point for my hand or the tip of the soldering guniron sometimes the frame of the chassis itself or a component already on the chassis like a metal transformer worked for loose boards or piece work i fabricated a metal grid with rubber feet that overlaid the work and created a firm surface where i could rest the tip or my hand
LifeProTips,not_removed,can you send a pic of your metal grid
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry left it at my last production job long ago it resembled an oven rack except the spaces between the horizontal crossbars are wider than normal and it has little legs with rubber caps on the end you could take an old oven rack snip out every other crossbar and solder legs on it and you would have essentially the same thing ill try to find a picture of one on the intertubes and post it here later
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok thanks that description was clearer im not a native speaker
LifeProTips,not_removed,fully thaw the pizza aint nobody got time for that
LifeProTips,not_removed,for personal pizzas i thaw it in the microwave for a minute or so then i throw it on a non stick skillet on medium with a thin layer of oil sometimes then as it forms a bit of a crust yet is still pliable i fold that bad boy in half to make myself a calzone of sorts i continue flipping the pizza pocket over until i am confident all the cheese had melted it gets to a super crunchy crust and you will definitely spend longer than all the other methods mentioned but if youre making a personal frozen pizza the constant flipping and ensuring the pizza will not burn might give you enough distraction from your reality maybe just so that the tears of loneliness you cry into your flaky crusty calzone might taste less salty edit gold thank you stranger no salty tears on my personal pizza tonight
LifeProTips,not_removed,this sounds like a real lpt i can use you have renewed my faith in this subreddit question how long does it take for a pizza stone to heat up i have one but i dont have a way see if it is heated up that doesnt involve degree burns can i just put the pizza stone in the cold oven turn the oven on and when my oven says it has reached the desired temperature assume the pizza stone is heated up enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,my personal favorite with frozen pizza is to toss some nice expensive cheese on it to improve the taste and also help me pretend that my life isnt slowly spiraling out of control
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is essentially how pizzas are made in pizza shops not frozen at all and a half minutes through the oven at f
LifeProTips,not_removed,last time i thawed a pizza out and put it directly on the bare rack it completely melted through dough and all and settled at the bottom of my oven dont think ill ever be doing that again
LifeProTips,not_removed,this sounds like a great way to test my smoke detector
LifeProTips,not_removed,worked for years on a wood fired pizza oven op is correct faster is better best is if you can heat a base for the pizza first pizza stone is best but other materials will do this crusys the bottom of the pizza while cooking the top i made my best pizzas engfer pizza works in santa cruz ca go there at around degrees in the oven and got pizzas through there in minutes from raw dough and cold toppings you can make good pizza a lot of ways but i always crank my oven to because that is the max
LifeProTips,not_removed,wouldnt the fresh garlic burn if its just exposed on top of a pizza like that
LifeProTips,not_removed,i once cooked a pizza on the clean setting for the oven was an old oven that had a slide lever like locking the dishwasherand i was i remember it being done really quickly surprisingly crispy and not blackened by the time my father disengaged the lock and got the ovan open i always wanted to do it again now i know how to recreate this and why all without the semi frantic oven disassembly thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,pizza stones work best
LifeProTips,not_removed,with all these extra steps mentioned in the comments garlic on crust oil with fresh basil heat the pizza stone for minutes make it into a calzone add fresh toppings at what point to you people stop buying frozen pizza youre already cooking for fucks sake and thereby negating the purpose of frozen pizza which is i want pizza as soon as possible and dont care if it sucks monkey balls
LifeProTips,not_removed,these sound like eminently sensible things to try praytell what caused you to experiment so thoroughly with frozen pizzas and does it make any difference if the most your oven will do is
LifeProTips,not_removed,commercial pizzas are baked in stone ovens that get up to degrees at least two of the big three dominos papa johns and pizza hut bake their pizzas on conveyors in hotair convection ovens which blast degree air across the top and bottom of the pizza simultaneously source am former big three employee of years ugh
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,the is the greatest thing ever invented
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive heard that throwing a frozen pizza on a preheated pizza stone could cause the stone to crack because of the temperature differential any risk of that
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who eats more pizza than any human should another trick i found that works with my pizza stone is to cook for at allow stone to preheat with the oven then switch to high broil for mins
LifeProTips,not_removed,whats interesting about this from a thermal perspective is that thawing and increasing oven temp achieves a very similar effect to heating a frozen pizza at normal oven temp the main thing is that pizza needs a steep thermal gradient to get the crust and toppings cookedcrisped and keep the subsurface cheese from separating or the sauce and inner crust from over cooking it is a delicate balance but this lpt maintains it artfully
LifeProTips,not_removed,youve said cook it on the bare rack is there any way i can make sure my pizza doesnt fall through the rack onto the oven base ive seen a few photos of that happening and holy shit it looks like a pain in the ass to clean also it ends with a severe lack of actual pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,you also forgot to mention the time it takes for a pizza to thaw and then to do this method would take longer than to just cook it
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i had a grill i loved making pizza in there i would crank it to max which got to about and the pizzas came out with a much better crust than i could get in the oven if you have a grill which can get hotter than your oven give it a shot for best results use indirect cooking so that the heat source is not directly under the pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm did exactly that yesterday serendipitously though best crust on any pizza ive ever had i ate it all which i never do
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha april fools day have a real lpt instead of a shitty one op
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree with the commercial pizza comment at my local pizza joint they cook the at for about minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are going to the trouble of brushing it with olive oil adding fresh garlic and thawing it out are you not better making your own
LifeProTips,not_removed,i honestly thought this was a rshittylifeprotips post
LifeProTips,not_removed,will try thanks i add herbs and spice to the frozen ones to make them slightly less sad also
LifeProTips,not_removed,instructions unclear house now in flames
LifeProTips,not_removed,this only applies to pizza that doesnt have any meat on it cooking meat too hot can form httpswwwcancergovaboutcancercausespreventionriskdietcookedmeatsfactsheet that increase the risk of cancer most dangerous is ham
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is the fastest way to thaw a pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess op prefers their pizza with a soggy bottom and burnt toppings
LifeProTips,not_removed,spoken like a true pizza guy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i tried this and i think i didnt turn up he temperature enough stomach felt very sick for the next few hours
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes but how do i talk to the pizza in order to become friends with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,not the best instructions imo pizza places that use a hot stone arent baking at the super high temperature they are moving the pizza around depending on how much more it needs to cook pizza places dont cook the pizza at the highest heat for the entire duration the cook the bottom with high heat first to sear and ensure the finish is a crispy bottom then its moved to a lower heat to bake the internals depending on how thick the dough is if the cheese on top isnt melted its lifted to the top where heat collects to melt the real tip to cheap frozen pizza at home without the long wait to thaw is a pizza stone you can use the normal instructions preheat the oven with the pizza stone and then wait another minutes before putting the pizza on the stone the bottom gets more crispy since the stone retains heat and the slow baking thaws and cooks so you get better pizza adding an extra minutes of time for the stone instead of however long it takes frozen pizza to fully thaw some people use a cast iron pan but most pans ive seen arent large enough to fit a family sized pizza they usually fit more personal sized pizzas
LifeProTips,not_removed,followed directions burnt down the house and caused a wildfire great pizza though
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who cooked pizzas for a living for a little while these are good tips but if you have the time and motivation its worth it to make your own diy pizza oven in the backyard and make your own dough and sauce very easy and tastes amazing
LifeProTips,not_removed,i prefer to bake my pizza and then throw the slice in a frying pan for minutes makes the bottom extra crispy
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive found following instructions on the pizza boxes works really well i trust their engineering and research than this generic lpt which can give you a crusty burnt pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i did this by accident one time pizza drooped down between the wire racks and completely fucked my oven for a while
LifeProTips,not_removed,great delivery on this lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont put a thawed pizza on the bare rack the pizza will melt down onto the bottom of your oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,heck dont even eat it just
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres a italian place down the street from my house that sells their raw pizza dough plus sauce for like for like a month i was making pizzas that were hot with melted cheese but the bottom crust was soft and the sauce sogged up the cheese and the crust took me forever to put it together that i needed it super hot and i need something like a pizza stone
LifeProTips,not_removed,also the veggieschicken that comes on those things are pitiful theres nothing stopping you from buying the cheesiest frozen pizza you can get and adding your own fresh toppings you probably already have red pepper or mushrooms in your fridge that are about to go bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,important note lots of oven racks have wires that are too far apart for this and your pizza will collapse into a smoke alarmwailing ovenruining disaster
LifeProTips,not_removed,hi my kitchen is on fire did i miss a step
LifeProTips,not_removed,directions unclear home in ruins
LifeProTips,not_removed,how long are looking at for defrost time for say a digiorno
LifeProTips,not_removed,how often you eat frozen pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked at for a large pizza chain shop for a couple years the pizzas were cooked at °f for minutes and while the dough comes frozen and many the toppings are frozen or deeply refrigerated as well everything is about °f when it goes in the oven pop the frozen disk in the fridge in the morning and it will be ready by lunch
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wouldnt call this a lpt this is a my opinion on what i like tip just too many variables pizza brand thickness ingredients ovens ect nothing stops a person from trying it or liking i just dont think it is a lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,unglazed ceramic tile from a hardware store works the same as a pizza stone for way cheaper
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have never understood frozen pizzas decent ones cost at least ten dollars a hot made one from dominos is only a decent hot made pizza can be found for with whatever choice you make you are still eating an unhealthy treat if you are splurging once a month why not get one that is hot and ready made for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,does this work with regular pizza as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thaw and cook under the broiler for minutes starting from a cold oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,cast iron pizza pans can be heated on the stove if youve got gas or induction much more quickly than in the oven so you can have the good crispy outer crust without preheating the oven forever when i make pizza from scratch i actually assemble the pizza sauce cheese whatever on the pan on the stove and then put it in the oven this lets the crust cook separately from the rest for a bit and gives a pretty good simulation of degree oven pizza in a consumer kitchen
LifeProTips,not_removed,and for that extra special frozen pizza time ill put minced garlic and butter w a tiny dash of salt in a shot glass for seconds then brush the crust w it when the pizza comes out then i dip the crust in the rest bc im a fatty at heart
LifeProTips,not_removed,will try this weekend will report back
LifeProTips,not_removed,this says its for cheap frozen pizzas ever try this in a good more pricey one like screamin sicilian
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like to add extra mozzarella cheese to my bagel bites before i cook them does this count
LifeProTips,not_removed,use a pizza stone as well and youre in better shape
LifeProTips,not_removed,also if your oven has a selfcleaning option that usually gets significantly hotter than the max temp so maybe use that a quick google search shows that some can reach degrees f just an idea i have never tried to cook anything with the cleaning option
LifeProTips,not_removed,just buy a pizza pizzazz its a fairly cheap gadget and its had the most use out of any gadget in my house it makes pizza perfectly and if you read the instructions you can cook other things on it too like fish sticks nuggets etc the thing does an amazing job
LifeProTips,not_removed,my room mate tried boiling a pizza once
LifeProTips,not_removed,always add italian seasoning
LifeProTips,not_removed,or alternatively and for a lot less you make your own pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,whenever i eat a damn frozen pizza it comes out soggy also the grease tastes like something off a road
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is good for preheating leftover pizza also if i have leftover pizza from dominos or something i heat it up in the oven and it is crispy and delicious the microwave makes it gross and soggy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wonder if my barbecue grill would work with gas burners i can get that thing pretty hot
LifeProTips,not_removed,so are we talking so hot it sets off the fire alarm as soon as you open the oven door hot or just like hot
LifeProTips,not_removed,hottest your oven will go except for pressing the clean button
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree thawing the pizza just adds time to the process and is something the pizza will natural undergo in a hot oven this really boils down to high temp shoter time pizza stone
LifeProTips,not_removed,a thin crust pizza like jacks will be done in minutes at as hot as you can go is going to turn those into charcoal
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can also fry the pizza for a crispy texture its easy but it takes practice
LifeProTips,not_removed,does thawing really do that much the temperature difference itsnt all that much is it if you chug it in a piping hot oven later
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i am making a frozen pizza i then obviously i dont care and just want something fast that i dont have to think about beyond setting a timer turing it into a two step process sounds like much more trouble then its worth
LifeProTips,not_removed,before putting anything in the oven microwave i will take the food out let it the for awhile minutes or so while i do some other things around the house than toss it in the oven while it preheats by the time it gets to full temp its about ready to eat
LifeProTips,not_removed,hottest temperature self clean mode
LifeProTips,not_removed,be careful using a stone at really high temps some cheap ones will crack especially if it gets too hot too fast
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrfirstworldanarchists
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you dont use a pan the pizza is gonna melt through the oven grill if not frozen can cause a fire
LifeProTips,not_removed,toss some shredded cheese on top too the cheese that comes on a frozen pizza is usually crap a bit of fresh cheese goes a long way
LifeProTips,not_removed,wont the box catch on fire
LifeProTips,not_removed,rpizza needs you
LifeProTips,not_removed,is plenty hot for this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like to go the other way get a baking tray fill it with dry ice and methanol and wait for it to stop boiling violently submerge your frozen pizza and wait for it to reach the temperature of the methanol at this point its roughly we dont deal with your monopoly money temperatures here in britain not take the cryogenically chilled pizza and bake it at degrees c for hours until you realise youve just wasted a huge amount of time and money and then just order dominos or if youre really fancy and live in south london firezza pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt buy a pizzazz
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can also use the slotted top part of a roasting pan you get really good circulation that way
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i had the patience to thaw it i wouldnt be making frozen pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just follow the instrictions and throw it right on the rack instead of a pan i get the same result note this might not work with saucier or thinner pizzas
LifeProTips,not_removed,but the askreddit thread told me that i must follow the instructions cause im stupid
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck frozen pizzas most grocery stores sell take n bakes for the same price that are better
LifeProTips,not_removed,no use put it on the bottom rack with nothing underneath cook it for less time on the box and check it a couple minutes early do not overcook the cheese you effing heathens
LifeProTips,not_removed,i do ellios pizza squareslet the stone get full temp foot at least minutes after oven hits temp shredded mozzgrated loccateligarlic powder oregano pepper crushed red pepper nice olive oil minutes then turn and move to a new part of the stone for to more minutes you get a crips crust and a perfect ellios
LifeProTips,not_removed,first lpt ive seen that hasnt been a crock of shit congratulations heres an upvote
LifeProTips,not_removed,buy a pizza stone already
LifeProTips,not_removed,may sound stupid but how long should it be thawed for
LifeProTips,not_removed,turkey bacon smells like empty childhood
LifeProTips,not_removed,ill just take the money i would save on my electric bill by not running the oven as hot as possible and put it towards a better pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,aint nobody got time for that
LifeProTips,not_removed,at this rate why not make the pizza from scratch
LifeProTips,not_removed,i put all my pizzas fully frozen straight on the rack at theyre ready when you can smell them from across the house not a burnt smell but a mmmm pizza smell perfect pizza every time been doing it this way for years and it has never failed me
LifeProTips,not_removed,for reheating your pizza drop the slice into a frying pan on medium heat for minutes to get an extra crispy crust
LifeProTips,not_removed,aint nobody got time for that
LifeProTips,not_removed,the whole idea behind frozen pizza is its supposed to be the least amount of work it is optimized for late work night dinners where youre too damn tired to make anything else if youre putting any kind of thought into making frozen pizza youre doing it wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,i sprinkle taco seasoning and chipotle tabasco on top of frozen pizzas before baking its the perfect spiceheat blend to counter the sweetness of frozen sauce
LifeProTips,not_removed,add shredded cheese they never put enough cheese on the frozen pizzas im low carbs now so havent done this in a while
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just buy digiornos i dont know how they do it but their pizza is better than most pizza place pizzas
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always toss them in the microwave for a fee minutes while the oven is heating this melts the cheese and thaws the toppings then a couple minutes in a super hot oven finishes it nicely
LifeProTips,not_removed,so you basically have to let it air out and blast the shit out of it to make the pizza taste good
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive cooked toaster pizza that burnt the cheese why doesnt this
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow thats some impressive pizzapassion right here
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you do this with a cast iron make sure you leave it in the oven for at least minutes at temperature before you put the pizza in it they take a looooong time to get up to temperature and if you put your pizza in a hot oven on a cold cast iron youre doing the exact opposite of what youre aiming for
LifeProTips,not_removed,for even better pizza brush the crust with olive oil before you bake and sprinkle either fresh garlic or garlic powder on it the garlic flavor helps to balance out the usually heavy handed and far too sweet sauce that goes on your average frozen pizza this is subjective and not a protip i mean i am on board i am just saying i also want to say balancing out flavors is not as simple as adding another flavor garlicy crust and too sweet sauce is still garlicy crust and too sweet sauce
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow this is gold im trying this tonight its so simple and obvious yet years into life and its a complete surprise for me any favorite brands that work best i usually buy freschetta or digiorno
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is not a good idea for all types of pizza you can end up with this
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not technically a frozen pizza but the stuff crust pizza available at the deli in walmart is really good and cooks up nicely in an oven its about and is often sold out at my local store they also have a cheaper frozen variety but its not quite as tasty
LifeProTips,not_removed,also save the plastic it is wrapped in and when you remove it from the oven place the bottom piece of plastic over the entire pizza for a few minutes it will puff up and not stick to the pizza and it makes the top melty like a delivery pizza sounds odd but it works
LifeProTips,not_removed,this reminds me of when i roasttoast legumes i freeze them after soaking them and then when im ready to cook i spread them frozen on the tray and place them in the oven at the hottest setting the end result is a softer crispy legume
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is indeed sage advice also if you have a big green egg or other ceramic grill they can get crazy hot i can do abut on mine and it rocks for pizzas
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt get a pizza stone or cook your frozen pizza on the grill
LifeProTips,not_removed,and on this day some poor year old was beaten senseless for burning his house down
LifeProTips,not_removed,for a better frozen pizza lpt for the canadians out there skip frozen pizza altogether if you have access to a superstoreloblaws with a deli they have take home and bake pizzas that are already not bad at all but can be elevated to pretty damn great by adding another cents worth of cheese and any other random toppings you like i put cherry tomatoes and olives from the olive bar usually so for a total unit cost of around you get a pizza thats way better than the frozen pizza the only catch is since theyre not frozen you need to cook then within a few days of buying
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just get a huge cast iron skillet and crank that bitch to max and then just put the pizza in there
LifeProTips,not_removed,i only eat tombstone frozen pizzas and the instruction make it perfect for minutes on the motherfucking rack its better than most delivery pizzas and im including most neighborhood shits
LifeProTips,not_removed,wipe the crust with butter first
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just follow the directions with about minutes shaved off with the convection setting if your oven has one obviously these are not hard and fast rules
LifeProTips,not_removed,and use a pizza stone for christ sake
LifeProTips,not_removed,oregano oregayes also if youre gonna add vegetables to your block of frozen pizza i suggest sauteing them separately first before adding them on top
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just always add some extra shredded cheese to my frozen pizzas they never come with enough cheese small touch but it makes the pizza much better
LifeProTips,not_removed,what an actual lpt a break from the usual lpt be nice posts
LifeProTips,not_removed,im glad you said put it right on the rack great advice for a nice crust if you like a spongey like soft crust bake it on a cookie sheet then
LifeProTips,not_removed,papa johns and dominos alum here they do minutes at degrees but none of the ingredients can be frozen
LifeProTips,not_removed,heres what i do i put on my own fresh ingredients i follow the directions and cook for the time it asks for then throw the pizza on my hot cast iron skillet this crisps the crust i found most of my cheese would burn if i cooked the full time by following the directions
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a lot of work and time to cook a dollar tombstone pizza bruh aint happening
LifeProTips,not_removed,finally a lpt that i will use
LifeProTips,not_removed,could someone tell me how to fully thaw a frozen pizza in a non stupid way the only thing i can think of right now is just letting it sit for a few dozen minutes at room temperature that doesnt seem like it would lend itself well to a quick lunch
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you have either of those heat it in the oven first and then cook the pizza on that once the oven hits its max temperature you actually have to let the stonecast iron heat in the oven even after it hits the max when the oven hits degrees the stone might only be at degrees
LifeProTips,not_removed,just cook it the recommend temp for the recommended time but right on the rack perfect pizza every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,add fresh toppings too i usually buy a frozen pizza with just pepperoni then add fresh mushrooms and black olives or peppers herbs whatever the fresh ingredients really ups the quality
LifeProTips,not_removed,ill buy the cheapo thin crust casa do mama pizzas in bulk cdn each add a bunch of extra pre grated frozen cheese along with some of my own toppings and cook it on a pizza stone if i dont like the cook after the time has run out ill broil it for minute or so fucking gourmet
LifeProTips,not_removed,your home oven will never get that hot challenge accepted
LifeProTips,not_removed,get a pizza stone and if you have one a grill that puppy will get to the degrees youre looking for
LifeProTips,not_removed,remove plastic overwrap before heating fuck you pizza box reddit told me not to listen to your lies
LifeProTips,not_removed,absolutely horrible advice for specific dr oetker pizzas they basically liquify and will fall through the rack instead of staying in one place source accidentally did this a few years ago came back to an oven with the bulk of my pizza sitting on the bottom of the oven with a ring of crust sitting on the rack use a pizza stone or a pan
LifeProTips,not_removed,your pizza could go from perfect to burned to a crisp in the span of a minute a little longer than minutes but i once found a large pizza shrunk down to the size density and color of a hockey puck after being left overnight in an oven good old college daysthe only reason the smoke detector did not go off the night before was because the kitchen if you could even call it that was in a small enclosed room and the smoke detector was outside that room so as soon as the door openedpoofinstant fire alarm and rolling clouds of smoke
LifeProTips,not_removed,get a pizza plus cooker on amazon bucks and they cook them great plus you can use it for all sorts of things
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is probably a good tip for the lower end frozen pizzas but theres plenty of higher end frozen pizza brands which are perfectly fine cooked in the oven by their instructions would this tip work better for homemade pizza however
LifeProTips,not_removed,i fucking hate frozen pizzas they disgust me only brand i like is california pizza kitchen ironically which ive never had fresh and their pizzas are pretty damn good just following the directions

LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt do not use your oven on the highest temperature or goes specially if its controlled by a computer it will ruin the board and your oven will no longer work a very costly repair i repair appliances for a living dont ever use the self clean in a oven i call it the self destruct button it gets your oven to the hottest available temperature and fries the board inside sometimes melting other components making me a lot of money
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought twice the temp half the time was an elaborate troll
LifeProTips,not_removed,just make your own pizza for fucks sake
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds like more work than just ordering a pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive been doing this for about a year now since starting frozen pizzas digiorno primo and primo thin crust are the best ones by far by the way have leapt right over delivery of both cheap chains pizza hut papa johns and delivery of real pizzerias on the list of best pizzas now if im not going to go to a pizzeria and eat it fresh at a table there but then i need to go out in public and waste my time sitting in some restaurant or make a pizza from scratch delicious but a lot more effort and super messy ill just thaw out a frozen pizza and cook it in minutes highly recommended also if you eat frozen or homemade pizza with any frequency or ever you have no excuse not to buy a pizza stone theyre like or and take your pizza from mediocre at best to practically restaurant quality
LifeProTips,not_removed,one could also modify the oven so the cleaning mode doesnt lock and cook the pizza at degrees

LifeProTips,not_removed,thin for thick or rising pizzas its much different there is a reason why deep dish takes minutes to cook

LifeProTips,not_removed,better tip just make your own dough its easy as pie buy the packets of pizza yeast follow instructions faster than thawing a frozen pizza tastes better do not place directly on rack
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt never eat a processed frozen pizza just dont
LifeProTips,not_removed,best cheapest homemade pizza you can make get one of those party packs plain cheese or pepperoni pizzas then got hit up the produce aisle a bell pepper onion garlic and pack of mushrooms will run you maybe another then go hit the dairy aisle for a pack of mozzarella dice up the vegetables relatively fine sprinkle them over the pizzas then add another thin layer of cheese and bake bonus points if you have a pizza stone to bake them on to help crisp up the crust and youve just easily fed four people with something that is going to taste far better than anything you get at a chain restaurant and that is much cheaper than anything you will see at a more upscale stoneoven place
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just eat them frozen
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive done this exact thing before and it absolutely destroyed the bottom of the crust every single time since frozen pizza you buy doesnt typically have a completely raw crust in the package its always burned the absolute shit out of the bottom of the crust
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually just break off about of the pizza to eat frozen while the rest cooks because i have to be starving to eat a frozen pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,tried setting my oven to degrees but after only one full rotation my back started hurting youre right home ovens barely make degrees let alone
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is how you convince idiots to burn their house down im sure ill just know when its been minutes ill count the seconds or something
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,my oven caps at celsius
LifeProTips,not_removed,fully thaw the frozen pizza im not sure you understand why most people buy frozen pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,most brick ovens run around fyi i dont recommend doing this unless you are watch it good way to waste food if not
LifeProTips,not_removed,alright so youre on the right track about high heat for pizzas however youre not quite so accurate about commercial cooking temps traditional conveyor style pizza ovens are set around and the pizza cooks in a few minutes maybe or so however neopolitan and associated spellings style pizzas are cooked at and if done right should not be crispy crust it should be springya bit chewy bonus tip if you want to cook it in your oven at that temp put it on selfcleaning mode this might mean modifying the locking mechanism though source im friends with httpwwwvarasanoscompizzarecipehtm who has a pretty highly rated pizza restaurant and the page i linked is pretty popular
LifeProTips,not_removed,get a pizza pizazz profit
LifeProTips,not_removed,seriously if i had thought that far ahead about dinner i sure as shit wouldnt be eating frozen pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,step one turn on oven step two open pizza box step three throw that bitch in cold oven step four wait until you smell burning step five take out of oven step six cut step seven eat immediately and tell the burning sensation in the roof of your moth to shut the fuck up optional step eight clean up and throw box away
LifeProTips,not_removed,the whole point of not allowing the pizza to thaw is actually a food safety concern its how they cover themselves legally so that they do not have to aseptically process the ingredients by instructing you to cook the pizza from frozen any bacteria on exposed to the pizza during the manufacturing process does not have a chance to form larger colonies that could potentially make you sick the rapid change in temperature is not conducive to growth thawing the pizza in the refrigerator circumvents this problem but it adds a significant amount time or foresight to the cooking process which isnt as attractive to consumers source used to work in quality control for food manufacturing
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i have time to thaw out a pizza i have time to make my own pizza or order one for delivery however an way to do this sort of but much faster is to microwave the pizza for a minute or seconds then throw it in the oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,i recently saw a picture of a pizza that had fallen through the rack the comments said that was a thawed pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,for best results for cooking frozen pizza ignore the box cooking instructions and throw the pizza in the trash and then make a pizza from scratch starting by making the dough the night before lifehacks bitches
LifeProTips,not_removed,pizza dough flour water and yeast takes minute make ten dough balls that you can keep in the fridge for up to five days or freeze and then make pizza or flat bread with whatever random toppings are around its so cheap in a normal oven on high on an upside down cookie sheet edit heat the cookie sheet first then slide the pie on a bit tricky i use two big knives to help the sliding process
LifeProTips,not_removed,amen brother i just eat my pizza frozen
LifeProTips,not_removed,microwave that bitch till its thaw bake that motherfuck in that hellfire oven till its crispy and delicious
LifeProTips,not_removed,its like a baked potato man they take forever to cook just throw a potato in the oven even if you dont want one because by the time its done who knows same with this lpt always leave a frozen pizza on your counter because you never know right
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly im drunk andor stoned i dont have time to wait

LifeProTips,not_removed,biaggia pizza oven no thawing no preheating
LifeProTips,not_removed,for personal pizzas i put them in the microwave for minutes and then quietly rethink my life choices as i silently eat my pizza watching jeopardy

LifeProTips,not_removed,calzones are pointless theyre just pizza thats harder to eat no one likes them good day sir
LifeProTips,not_removed,calzones are pointless they are just pizzas that are harder to eat no one likes them good day sir
LifeProTips,not_removed,someone guild this guy i spent my last few bucks on a digiorno
LifeProTips,not_removed,while reading your post i went from being hungry to being sad and still hungry
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the correct answer its also the best way to reheat old pizza microwave a bit and then pan fry that thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,i didnt sign up for this
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck man cant a happy man enjoy a decent ass calzone without crying sweet loneliness
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can buy an infrared thermometer for under not only will it help with your oven temps but you can use it to find warm spots in your fridge cold spots in your home check your pan temps on the stove and so on itll also probably have a laser sight and double as a cat toy i highly recommend getting one
LifeProTips,not_removed,my stone instructions tell me to leave it in the oven for min after the oven reaches the recommended temperature before putting a pizza on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,get a pizza steel instead heats up very fast conducts heat to the pizza better than stone and wont randomly crack in uneven heating conditions
LifeProTips,not_removed,the way i did it with a cast ironslab for lack of a better word was to stick it in the oven as it heated up to the max temperature and then let it sit for maybe another five minutes you want the plate to be as hot as possible so that it cooks the crust from the bottom as the oven heat cooks the rest of it thats part of how you get crisp crusts without burning everything else
LifeProTips,not_removed,pizza stones are usually ceramic so they take a long time to heat up leave it in the oven as it heats up
LifeProTips,not_removed,no leave the stone in there for a while longer say minutes you need it as hot as possible so when the pizza hits it the stone doesnt drop in temperature too much
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you know you need discipline and not motivation
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use a cast iron pizza pan but what i do is after the oven reaches temperature i stick the pan right under the broiler for minutes and it gets really hot really fast not sure if you can do this with a stone but im thinking its probably ok too
LifeProTips,not_removed,cant you just sprinkle some water on it to see if its hot
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends on the thickness of your pizza stone but id say at least minutes after the oven has come to temperature
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes you can its exactly what i do
LifeProTips,not_removed,flick a few drops of water on the stone if they bounce around its hot
LifeProTips,not_removed,the frozen pizzas ive bought usually newmans own specifically say not to use a pizza stone
LifeProTips,not_removed,amen a little selfgrated asiago works wonders for crippling depression
LifeProTips,not_removed,at the pizza place where i work its unfrozen at for mins
LifeProTips,not_removed,at my favorite pizza place in town its more like minutes at degrees
LifeProTips,not_removed,aint no one got time to wait for it to thaw
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol yea even not preheating has done that to me when the pizza was thin enough i think this lpt requires a pizza stone or at least a baking sheet
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats how you make a calzone
LifeProTips,not_removed,just put some baking paper under it
LifeProTips,not_removed,cookin so good even the fire alarm hoots and hollers
LifeProTips,not_removed,clean your oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,nahh i work in a pizza place and garlic does just fine at degrees resilient stuff i guess
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive seen it work fine at build your own pizza places though full disclosure i did use powdered garlic p
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont use garlic use olive oil and oregano instead much nicer then chop up some basil and throw that on after its cooked
LifeProTips,not_removed,the pizza i buy newmans own specifically says not to use a pizza stone
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you dont have access to a pizza oven sure
LifeProTips,not_removed,the purpose of frozen pizza which is i want pizza as soon as possible and dont care if it sucks monkey balls not really i think in most places in the us you can get a pizza delivered faster than cooking a frozen pizza where i live i can get a real pizza in about the time it takes to preheat the oven i do agree all this extra crap seems antithetical to the purpose of frozen pizza frozen pizza is for a cheap meal where you dont have to go out or call anyone or do anything but turn on the oven and set a timer its supposed to be easy
LifeProTips,not_removed,fun fact the first boxed cake mixes were tested in focus groups as combine mix with water no egg no milk just mix with water they wouldnt sell because people didnt want something that instant because why bother dirtying a pan at that point so they took a few ingredients out added two steps to the box and now thats how boxed cake mixes are packaged now people just want to add an extra step to make it theirs
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually put foil on the rack below when making drippy food but ive never really had an issue with frozen pizza dripping down the edge maybe i get especially shitty pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,i put a on the oven rack no droop good airflow easier to remove pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive been having to make quick meals for myself recently for various reasons and naturally frozen pizza is the first thing that comes to mind except that its pretty disgusting just straight from the box to the oven ive seen people dress up all sorts of pre made stuff like canned soup or frozen pot pies etc so i figured why not pizza as far as your oven temperature is probably as low as would still count for this method any lower and youd basically be doing the temperature on the box although higher temperatures probably wouldnt hurt for reference my oven does side note ive heard stories of people using the self clean setting to cook their pizza for the highest possible temperatures but some ovens will lock the door when you do that so i never tried it do it at the risk of incinerated char for dinner
LifeProTips,not_removed,i manage a franchised pizza place we hit our pizzas at for and they have been cooking fine for our company for over years its a conveyor belt oven too not a brick or stone one
LifeProTips,not_removed,most home ovens will top off at
LifeProTips,not_removed,those have to be home made pizzas where they didnt do the crust right or something ive been baking frozen pizza on the rack for years and years and nothing even remotely close to that has happened
LifeProTips,not_removed,confirmed my wife gets annoyed when i put a pizza on her bare rack
LifeProTips,not_removed,ctrlfd pizzazz greatest thing ever for pizza it can make a pizza taste amazing it makes reheated oven pizza taste better than it did when you first cooked it its so damn awesome
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think thats why hes saying to completely thaw your pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,this itll give you those brown cheese bubbles you love so much also if youre cooking on the bare rack ive found putting a baking sheet on the rack below helps to keep the bottom of your pizza from burning wo restricting airflow
LifeProTips,not_removed,you could put a cookie sheet underneath it on the lower rack to catch anything if something goes wrong but if were going through the trouble of thawing the pizza getting a cheap ceramic tile from the hardware store and using it for pizza making is probably a better option less mess better pizza papa johns
LifeProTips,not_removed,put a on the oven rack
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think this lpt is meant to speed up the time it takes to make pizza but instead make it taste better
LifeProTips,not_removed,wat arent regular pizza ovens way hotter than your kitchen oven though
LifeProTips,not_removed,volcano
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just get real close and mouth breathe heavily on it while whispering soon you will be mine
LifeProTips,not_removed,use a flame thrower
LifeProTips,not_removed,microwave defrost but that often cooks part of it and tastes nasty probably better to just cook the frozen pizza if its sealed in plastic the next fastest way is to submerge it in cold water it will probably take min
LifeProTips,not_removed,microwave
LifeProTips,not_removed,the trick is to also thaw it first when frozen its literally unable to respond when its hot it either loses its calm real quick or you already burned it alive good luck on your future endeavours
LifeProTips,not_removed,frozen pizza chicken gags me and ive eaten food off the ground in iraq before
LifeProTips,not_removed,not that often really i dont like it very much which is what prompted my experiments
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive never ate a frozen pizza ive always cooked it
LifeProTips,not_removed,its very common in areas where pizza doesnt deliver and pizza places are far away from home
LifeProTips,not_removed,because where i live the cheapest pizza of that size is and a frozen pizza is and you dont have to wait to get it delivered or go out to pick it up
LifeProTips,not_removed,any self respecting pizza lover laughs in the face of your once a month estimate
LifeProTips,not_removed,a frozen pizza can be kept in the freezer and made quickly at any time
LifeProTips,not_removed,doing pizzas on grills is usually better than ovens so go for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,grill pizza is fantastic dont use the burners directly under the pizza though put the pizza in the middle and use the two far side burners also grill fries are amazing as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,seems like the goal here is cheap and better not necessarily fast
LifeProTips,not_removed,for whatever reason im giggling imagining a large pizza shriveling into a hockey puck
LifeProTips,not_removed,take and bake pizzas lots of grocery stores have them now because once you get the dough figured out the rest of the process is a breeze and the ingredients are so damn cheap and even walmart has some that when cooked right are down right not bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,i never plan on eating a frozen pizza for dinner i end up eating one
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you dont have time its faster if you nuke it and stick it in the oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,my friend just puts it in the oven when he starts preheating it and it helps thaw nicely
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the brightest thing ive heard all week
LifeProTips,not_removed,step lick the blistered roof of your mouth for the next hours
LifeProTips,not_removed,leave the moth alone
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like the cut of your jib
LifeProTips,not_removed,step nine tell yourself that its brown but it tastes better this way
LifeProTips,not_removed,step is repeat steps through for a year then move
LifeProTips,not_removed,just put in the refrigerator not the freezer it will last a while and will be mostly thawed
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a bad fucking day right there
LifeProTips,not_removed,what the fuck
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive shoved frozen pizzas in the oven before and didnt have this happen why would it do this
LifeProTips,not_removed,if the instructions say preheat for x minutes make sure your oven is at temp for at least x minutes you get more radiant heat that way and the pizza cooks more evenly and it adds like to your pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,why didnt you use a platform where to put the pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,whoa i didnt know people didnt use pizza rocks for this stuff i just didnt buy frozen pizzas until i bought a pizza rock
LifeProTips,not_removed,time isnt necessarily the biggest driver for buying frozen
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive froze the dough balls with no problem you can even use the thawing time to allow some flavor to ferment
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh yeah sure you have time to post here and not on tfts cmon man its been hours we are all waiting s i am truly excited to see the final part of your epic tale
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont even cut it just roll it up like a burrito and eat it
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait so youre not loudly yelling answers faster than the other contestants while watching jeopardy maybe im the lonely one
LifeProTips,not_removed,everything he said should be on the pizza box tbh
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,the calzones they betrayed me
LifeProTips,not_removed,perhaps salty water like tears
LifeProTips,not_removed,i do this with my grilled cheeses speaking of grilled cheeses i did away with butter on the outside of the bread and replaced it with mayonnaise ill never look back
LifeProTips,not_removed,what do you call a shittymorph post that doesnt end with a hell in a cell reference a regular story
LifeProTips,not_removed,pizza never heard of it is what your kids are going to be saying calzones are your grandfathers pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,you had me at meat tornado
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was at a birthday party for a retired engineer last weekend and his brother bought him an infrared thermometer as a birthday gift it was the big hit of the party we were temping our skin the walls our coffee everything it was fun to find out the people in our group who constantly complain about having cold hands did in fact have slightly lower surface skin temperature then we ate pasta with red sauce chicken cacciatore bell peppers stuffed with vegetables romaine hearts with two kinds of vinaigrette and a very nice storebought chocolate cake and holy shit writing this anecdote out and then reading it makes me feel super fucking old fuck
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive learned that the ir thermometers can be off as much as i learned this comparing my personal thermometer to my shops calibrated fluke thermometer
LifeProTips,not_removed,can i see how hot my farts are can i then create a competition for hottest fart perhaps some research to see if certain foods yield hotter farts
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats good advice as an infrared thermometer is useful for so many things specifically for testing pizza stones however that might be overkill usually i just put the stone in the oven when i preheat it then forget that its hot and grab it bare handed to put the pizza on
LifeProTips,not_removed,and you can find all the ghosts in your house
LifeProTips,not_removed,confirmed source am cook and use the laser sight as a human toy as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,this the internal temperature of the stone will take longer to heat up than the oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,heats up very fast how fast im interested in trying one but the first one i pulled up on amazon said to heat the thing for an hour maybe its the quality of the steel
LifeProTips,not_removed,cold water on hot cast iron may cause it to crack be careful doing this
LifeProTips,not_removed,that will tell you if its above youre looking for surface temperature theres no great way to tell without a thermometer
LifeProTips,not_removed,and thats how you end up with a broken pizza stone
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats wasteful just put your hand on it the human body comes with preinstalled temperature sensors and shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a lot of wasted energy
LifeProTips,not_removed,put it in your pants while at work when you get home at night it will be thawed
LifeProTips,not_removed,perforated pizza sheets are a good thing to have
LifeProTips,not_removed,then itll be nicely wrapped in paper when it hits the bottom
LifeProTips,not_removed,really i managed a pizza place for a year and we always put fresh garlic under the cheese or else it would burn severely degrees for minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,degrees holy shit i worked as a cook at an italian place before that had pizza on the menu pizza was the most popular item actually despite the restaurant being a ristorante italian word used for a fancyexpensiveupscale restaurant and we did max if it was busy preferably if not too busy we used a convection oven rather than a traditional pizza oven though and we prebaked the crusts inhouse in the mornings they were prebaked to a pliable bready but not crispy and not doughy state this made the final pizza come out with a nice crispy crust without any hint of doughiness under the toppings or having to bake until the toppings were nearly burnt the average pizza using this method took roughly minutes in the convector at or about minutes at to get nice little light brown blister marks on the cheese i cant even imagine a convector at it seems like the sauce and inside of the crust would still be cold by the time the outside was burning
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah frozen pizza on the stone would be burned on the bottom before the middle even thaws if you let the pizza thaw first then the stone would work
LifeProTips,not_removed,and you honestly think something is fundamentally different about that pizza that would make it and the stone incompatible no its about somebodys opinion vs your own if they dont explain on the box what theyre talking about and you never challenge it by trying it on a stone you will forever be in the dark speculating then again some people find comfort in always following someone elses direction sometimes taking a risk can be dangerous this is not one of those times
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not a problem unless you let it thaw first
LifeProTips,not_removed,the one time it happened to me it wasnt quite like the pictures all the edges flopped down instead with basically the same results was when i baked a frozen pizza is when i left it on the counter for too long before putting it in the oven because it defrosted which turns it from a solid slab into a piece of dough with little structural integrity you could just put the pizza on a piece of parchment paper and it would be fine
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats what i was thinking as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,its a pretty barbaric practice in general its basically the putting something in the microwave without a plate of the oven world that said i still do it oh wait were you making a boobs joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,true but if you wanted better tasting pizza you would get something other than store bought frozen pizza p i do it for convenience and im lazy but there is a place decently close to my house thats worth going to for quality pizza just not all the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,this also ensures that the pizza doesnt have an erection when you put it into the oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,technically correct reasonably unreasonable
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha nice thats why i go four cheese and add my own protein
LifeProTips,not_removed,plus you can buy frozen pizza for £ where as a takeaway can easily be upwards of £ sometimes i just want a quick cheap pizza without the cost
LifeProTips,not_removed,to be honest it was a little larger but still at least reduced in size from original pure black and solid i swear to god i took a photo of it at the time but have not been able to find it since finding that photo is like my white whale also it was not me who cooked it i swear this was in a dormresidence hall with other guys i assume someone got drunk and went to bed instead of eating their pizza nobody ever admitted to it since the smoke alarmfire alarm meant everyone got to go outside in the cold at about am
LifeProTips,not_removed,aldi has a pretty good one for
LifeProTips,not_removed,those walmart pizzas are actually really good me and my wife get them all the time we were surprised they werent terrible and for they are cheap too
LifeProTips,not_removed,takeandbake pizzas are weird to me they exist in this neitherfishnorfowl middle ground of priceconveniencequality in any case theyre pretty much nonexistent where i live
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed take n bake is the best
LifeProTips,not_removed,had a walmart take and bake pizza that was bucks it was garbage thin crust sucks much rather would have gotten a dollar pizza from little ceasars
LifeProTips,not_removed,down right not bad such an interesting compliment
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love making pizza but anyone will tell you that the dough is by far the most time consuming part of making pizza if you find a good pizza place you can often buy their raw dough and cook it at home at that point you just need to put on sauce and toppings and bake it super easy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use the microbake technique a lot microwave until thawed and then bake thats a real lpt works great for lots of frozen foods but ops suggestion was to thaw
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah thats fine but the whole point of the op is to get the highest quality you can out of your frozen pizza in which case you should not be doing this
LifeProTips,not_removed,completely thawed unless your refrigerator is below freezing for some reason
LifeProTips,not_removed,the only safe way to thaw it too or microwave
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats why i always cover the bottom of the oven with aluminum foil
LifeProTips,not_removed,pop pop
LifeProTips,not_removed,ultimate test of the selfcleaning feature
LifeProTips,not_removed,most appropriate reaction
LifeProTips,not_removed,that one was probably thawed and put into a cold oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,crust was too softthin clearly not meant to be placed on the rack like that or home made by an idiot
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont forget to put a few honda vtec stickers on your oven i heard that adds hp
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is tfts
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,instructions unclear dick fused into molten cheese calzone
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would buy the shit out of that company
LifeProTips,not_removed,mayo on the outside of a grilled cheese never heard of itbut im curious
LifeProTips,not_removed,girlfriend showed me this i hate my mother from hiding it from us for so long
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a solid idea ive been doing it for years however lately when i make a grilled cheese i like using really good cheese and those are a no go for mayo
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah my friend kagan did this when we were younger and it sounded disgusting since i absolutely fucking hate bullshit pointless creams like mayonnaise and sour cream it was surprisingly awesome even though i havent had any grilled cheeses in years this would be the way to go if i were to have one
LifeProTips,not_removed,put cheese on the outside
LifeProTips,not_removed,a portable delicious meal that is its own container its a whole new spin on italian fast casual dining
LifeProTips,not_removed,stand in the place where you
LifeProTips,not_removed,local calzone zone
LifeProTips,not_removed,imagine a restaurant that would serve fast casual italian food made with only lowfat and lowcalorie ingredients what should we call it
LifeProTips,not_removed,your anecdote was fine and relevant until you topped it off with your dinner menu straight out of roldpeoplefacebook
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you just cross out the word retired i could totally see my friends doing this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have to get a present for a birthday party my kid is attending tonight is this appropriate for a year old
LifeProTips,not_removed,this party sounds off the hook man what time did the cops show up
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe some fava beans and a nice chiantifvvvfvvvhfvhhhhh
LifeProTips,not_removed,we would always have one at the shirt printing shops ive worked at to check the temperature of the ink as shirts came down the dryer belt but nine times out of ten we were just fucking around trying to blind each other with the laser or checking the temperature of our beers
LifeProTips,not_removed,im just glad it didnt end with that wrestlemania story
LifeProTips,not_removed,asking the important questions
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had a similar question forever nowbut had no idea where to find and answer to it my spin on it is how does a fart move does it rise due to heat does it just go right through the spaces of fibers in your pants or does it follow the path of least resistance and travel down your pant leg it would be useful to figure out how to evade the smell you know is coming
LifeProTips,not_removed,but if you put it in while preheating the oven it will take longer to preheat because the stone is sucking all of that heat out of the air all in all though i think it would be fastest start to finish to put the stone into the oven when you just turn it on versus turning it on letting the oven get to temperature then putting the stone in for minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have two pizza pans a cheap one and a decent one and its hard to wash them by hand because the heat transfers from the hot water so quickly and thoroughly
LifeProTips,not_removed,eh a few drops drizzled then cover lets the steam melt the cheese its by far the best way to revive day old pizza or eat it cold for breakfast like a normal person
LifeProTips,not_removed,just put your hand on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you dunk it in water yes if you wet the tips of your fingers and flick water on to it in the way that ive done to check the temperature of cast iron pans my entire life its not happening youre going to cause a greater difference in temperature by putting a pizza on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,why the whole reason you use a pizza stone is to bombard it with energy to later put all that energy back into the crust of your pizza stone doesnt transfer heat that well so it takes quite a while for the stone to reach the right temperature the way to speed up the process is to use a pizza steel since steel transfers heat much much better it heats up faster and transfers heat to your pizza faster only downside is pizza steels are more expensive than stones and harder to find once i see a pizza steel for sale ill buy it instantly
LifeProTips,not_removed,also i must add i use my pizza stone at degrees celcius and after half an hour in a preheated oven my ir thermometer still reads in the middle of the stone it really takes a while
LifeProTips,not_removed,the real lpt is always in the comments
LifeProTips,not_removed,lunch butt
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe your pizza ovens had less clearance between elements and the pizza assuming there were elements and they werent woodfired or something
LifeProTips,not_removed,well to roast garlic it takes a solid mins at deg but the idea is to keep the moisture in im shock that you all burn fresh garlic that quickly
LifeProTips,not_removed,minutes minutes seconds minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow youre taking this way too seriously its a frozen pizza for the record my in laws buy the same pizza and insist on cooking it on a pizza stone it always comes out with a soggy crust its always nice and crispy when i cook it on the oven rack
LifeProTips,not_removed,made this mistake last week it was unbearable
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i was a kid i was making a pizza and saw the lever on the oven to lock it and start cleaning i had no idea what it was so naturally i pulled it oven locks cleaning begins nothing will stop it that was the day i learned how to use the breaker box
LifeProTips,not_removed,also as someone who once fixed ovens the self clean is really hard on the oven the amount of calls i got that started with i turned on self clean and now
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait really at dominos we did like for minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,papa johns first opened years ago
LifeProTips,not_removed,pounds dont know how to make that symbol sounds like a good deal to me in boston a good take outdelivery pizza can be pounds
LifeProTips,not_removed,the aldi ones are the size of a flying saucer and quite good
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm aldis pizza eater here
LifeProTips,not_removed,aldi pizzas are the shit so good for the price
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually get the pepperoni one and then add my own veggies to it and more cheese makes a fantastic pizza for
LifeProTips,not_removed,whoa whoa whoa theres aldi in america
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup we just buy them and leave them in the refrigerator cause we know well use it quickly also we add our own toppings after we open it its a cheap epic pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,the most expensive frozen pizzas here are like € aldi has one for like € and a really good one for €
LifeProTips,not_removed,theyre big as shit too
LifeProTips,not_removed,my son and i swear by aldis pizzas and im from new jersey known for the best pizza in america
LifeProTips,not_removed,carlos chorizo and pepperoni with cheese stuffed crust better than a lot of pizza places something like £ around
LifeProTips,not_removed,just had this for dinner last night super affordable and tasty
LifeProTips,not_removed,aldi is in the usa now crazy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i live next to one guess i should shop there huh
LifeProTips,not_removed,it is legit very good especially when cooked like op suggests
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love aldi such savings
LifeProTips,not_removed,aldi is still one of the best pizzas ive had lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont know if you get the same ones we get in the uk but those big oval shaped ones are peng
LifeProTips,not_removed,aldi pizza and bacon is incredible add lots of peppercorn and drops of real maple syrup to your aldi bacon to feel like you paid for it easy on the syrup though
LifeProTips,not_removed,you have aldi in the us i thought they were a european brand til
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i make aldi pizzas i turn the oven on ° and toss it in right away by the time the oven heats up the first pizzas done
LifeProTips,not_removed,i miss aldi so very much
LifeProTips,not_removed,i prefer the sams club pizza over the one that my local aldi sells
LifeProTips,not_removed,my grandfather used to love aldi when i would visit him in wisconsin to help take care of him that would be one of our for sure stops when we went out he loved taking me because then he could take his time looking around hed then run off because he remembered something else he wanted leaving younger me to stand in line while i panic about getting our groceries scanned next it was funny because he was always super happy with what he got for his money it was a special day because it was the day i flew in so we mobbed over to aldis because he really wanted some of their boxed steaks and some mushrooms to cook up for that night i remember he bought extra mushrooms even though i said i wasnt a fan then told grandma he missheard me so he could really pile them on to his steak he was one of my favorite peoplle in this world something as small as an aldi could bring this man so much joy he passed away a few years after crazy how something so insignificant as an aldi could bring back so many good albeit bittersweet memories for me thank you guys i had a trip writing this a feels trip
LifeProTips,not_removed,we must have the worst aldi ever based on reddits love for them ours is so dirty and disgusting i could never eat anything fresh there i can barely buy the canned goods most of the meat is past expiration dates fruits and veggies are rotten the cooler for lunch meat and cheese is broken and warm all the time place is a death trap
LifeProTips,not_removed,mama cozzi pepperoni pizzas are the best frozen pizza you can buy and its those little chunks of pepperoni in the sauce make that shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,where i live pizze salame for € are the norm throw on some cheap boiled ham emmentaler cheese and some herbs and youve got yourself a nice cheap meal
LifeProTips,not_removed,harris teeter does a huge pizza any toppings any style for on mondays
LifeProTips,not_removed,market basket grocery stores ones with a full kitchen ive always seem them but not sure if they all have them will let you call in a one topping pizza for bucks and they are amazing not as cheap as a frozen pizza but for the sizehaving a fresh made pizza this is miles better and cheaper than all the big chains
LifeProTips,not_removed,dollars for a pizza why not just order dominos at that price
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked in a walmart deli in college and sold the shit out of those things one day i decided to do free samples and we sold what would typically be a weeks supply of pizzas in six hours walmart really is making strides towards improving the quality of their products and even treating their employees like people unfortunately their year experiment with treating employees like cattleexpendable parts has soured me towards ever going back there no matter how much things improve
LifeProTips,not_removed,i buy most of my pizzas for i feel like im splurging if i spend to upgrade to red baron is a luxurious pizza to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,it tastes like theyre using ketchup for the sauce sorry pal your ability to detect good pizza is very suspect and just to cut off anyone at the pass ny pizza is superior to chicago pizza sincerely richard nixon
LifeProTips,not_removed,preach my man the bacon one is better than a few delivery places ive visited
LifeProTips,not_removed,for many they can be bought with ebt while fully cooked delivery pizzas cannot it can be a draw for those in food stamps
LifeProTips,not_removed,really i actually prefer papa murphy take and bake to a lot of restaurants where do you live i need to open one there
LifeProTips,not_removed,my wife makes a pretty good pizza dough but ideally pizza dough should sit in a coolerfridge for hours before being cooked to get the proper consistency and make it easier to spread into the perfect thickness alas my ability to think beyond my next meal is lacking
LifeProTips,not_removed,that might be it
LifeProTips,not_removed,rtalesfromtechsupport he has a part special going on it been releasing one part a day but he is so mean leaving it on a cliff hanger each time they are such a good read though but we want more
LifeProTips,not_removed,rtalesfromtechsupport
LifeProTips,not_removed,it sounds absurd i know my cousin told me a few years ago while camping since we didnt have butter its just browns and grills it more evenly and although im notorious for over using butter mayo takes the trophy for grilling a grilled cheese
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hate that my mother raised me on turkey bacon and margarine my whole life
LifeProTips,not_removed,absolutely fucking hate bullshit pointless creams like mayonnaise and sour cream wut
LifeProTips,not_removed,its basically an italian taco
LifeProTips,not_removed,and if you make them healthy you can open a restaurant called bens lowcal calzone zone
LifeProTips,not_removed,stand
LifeProTips,not_removed,a salad bar
LifeProTips,not_removed,old people gotta mention that chocolate cake was storebought
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha absolutely was thinking the same
LifeProTips,not_removed,my maternal grandma would tell this story exactly like this but then she would spend minutes attempting to remember the name of the kind of vinaigrette in the middle of the story and she wouldnt be able to remember if her hand was degrees or and it would take minutes of going back and forth before she settled on
LifeProTips,not_removed,left out the part when they started playing connect the liver spots
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not even and that menu sounds divine
LifeProTips,not_removed,no year olds should not have kids
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think if i were setting up competitions i would design clothing that would help the fart escape maybe just a hole with velcro to open it at first but as more money flooded in for pro farters there would probably be advanced designs with exhaust tubes running directly from the anus
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is an excellent way to reduce the life of your stone most manufacturers recommend that you heat them with the oven to prevent cracking most manufacturers are right i lost my first stone because of that
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah thats what theyre saying put the stone in then turn on the oven wait for it to finish preheating then wait more minutes then put the pizza in its important for the stone to heat up fairly gradually so it doesnt shock and break but it takes longer to fully reach temperature than the air around it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i put mine in a second oven then transfer it carefully to the already preheated oven then the pizza and stone are moved to my third oven
LifeProTips,not_removed,talking about your oven it would take around min or so to reach then youd have to wait min and then cook another min thats min for your oven to run on while regularly its on for min to preheat and min to cook on you double the run time of your oven is what i was saying wasted energy meaning energy bill
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is a pizza steel besides a giant hunk of steel honestly i dont know
LifeProTips,not_removed,go to your local steel fabrication shop i didnt know how common they were until i started looking theyll cut you whatever dimension of mild steel you want i got my pizza steel for they also cut me two circular steels for my green egg also in the range youre welcome
LifeProTips,not_removed,roasting garlicin its husks sure raw chopped garlic is going to burn within minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,the decisions you make with that can change the way you handle everything just a pizza nope its a life changer
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats why you only do a self clean right before youre going to have people in for a big family dinner it keeps people like you in business
LifeProTips,not_removed,you guys have thicker crusts than like the rest of the fast food pizza chains it makes sense that yours would be the longest at the highest temp
LifeProTips,not_removed,its been a good years since i worked there but the temps were hovering around if i remember and the belt took idk minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i say and upwards of £ youre looking at about £ for a good one at a decent size £ will get you something small
LifeProTips,not_removed,made one a couple weeks ago ive been eating it ever since
LifeProTips,not_removed,an aldi just opened up by my house i usually use it for stocking up the pantry next time i go i will have to get one of the pizzas and give it a try thanks for the tip king kind stranger
LifeProTips,not_removed,add my own veggies to it and more cheese this is a vital addition to frozen pizzas they always skimp out on the cheese almost no one wants a pizza with half the appropriate amount of cheese
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep
LifeProTips,not_removed,aldis being in america is the reason why im able to eat right now
LifeProTips,not_removed,for like years dude you clearly arent an east coaster
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait they pay you € to take it away
LifeProTips,not_removed,weve had them for at least years
LifeProTips,not_removed,the best frozen pizza you can buy is actually screamin sicilian
LifeProTips,not_removed,probably canadian is a great price for a pizza dominos would be like
LifeProTips,not_removed,because a same size and topping pizza from dominos would run at least
LifeProTips,not_removed,dominos is pretty bad but i guess everyones tastes are different if the walmart pizza is anything close to sams pizza then its definitely better than dominos
LifeProTips,not_removed,because its terrible
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre going to pay just between the delivery fee and tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,add delivery fee tip tax and the same amount of toppings and you are way over bucks
LifeProTips,not_removed,this read like a college essay
LifeProTips,not_removed,i only go to walmart for things i cant buy anywhere else for example they have such a huge variety of sugar free drink mixes however i stopped going there because i put a cake order in a week ahead of time and it wasnt even started when my wife went to pick it up all because they didnt have anyone working the bakery because their pay is shit and they treat employees like shit maybe its changed but they can suck a dick
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh man did you have to do the pre shift dance or whatever the fuck it was
LifeProTips,not_removed,treating their employees like people lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,its also the case with papa murpheys pizza no tax and you can use ebt
LifeProTips,not_removed,and yes we are stalking him
LifeProTips,not_removed,link
LifeProTips,not_removed,who is he another i stopped going to that sub once i realized that of the stories are bs and the rules prevent any critical thinkers from truth hunting
LifeProTips,not_removed,overusing butter is a thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes it sounds odd but im soldmust try this
LifeProTips,not_removed,its awesome
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,that bitch alice couldnt even take minutes to bake a damn cake she had to go buy this dry walmart piece of crap
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude add artichoke hearts and banana peppers to a standard frozen pepperoni pizza and youve just gone from paper plates to fine china
LifeProTips,not_removed,im recently bought an infrared thermometer i can confirm my balls are a couple of degrees cooler than my core
LifeProTips,not_removed,am have one at work not only is it useful for engineering purposes it also helps me make sure my coffee isnt too hot to drink also my laptop puts out a surprising amount of heat
LifeProTips,not_removed,how many years did he spend writing that comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,the chapter needs to be longer no wrries bruh heres words describing this characters dorneish boots
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey theres a switcharooythingy over here hows this thing gocan someone certified take over
LifeProTips,not_removed,but what about no year olds
LifeProTips,not_removed,extremely yes itll prob even spark an interest in science if youre lucky
LifeProTips,not_removed,you guys use stones i just have a crooked metal plate
LifeProTips,not_removed,i do this too but then alternate between my fourth and ninth oven every two minutes during cooking then finish off in my seventh oven for seconds perfect crust every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats min for your oven to run on hoe much energy does it take to keep an empty oven hot theres no part on my oven thats uncomfortably hot to touch in my case heat from the oven means i use less energy heating the house its not a good way to heat the house but at least the energy is not wasted in other cases any heat will be removed with an ac which would make it a much bigger problem
LifeProTips,not_removed,at this point it is probably better to just order pizza cooked proper tastes better and will either be cheaper or around the same cost i am going to guess cheaper because using your oven at max temp for that long cant be cheap and i am sure it uses more than the difference from frozen pizza to ordered pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,i forgot we were talking about frozen pizzas here and youre right using this method to bake grocery store pizzas is a waste of energy however when you make pizzas from scratch like i do you really need the heat from the pizza stone to get a nice and crispy bottom crust then the heating time is worth it and you can make multiple pizzas once the stone has heated up
LifeProTips,not_removed,its exactly that a giant hunk of steel it has to be foodsafe obviously but in essence its just a plate that can hold a lot of energy and transfer it to your pizza quickly
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant bear this
LifeProTips,not_removed,dominos does it for thin crust and brooklyn style too fyi
LifeProTips,not_removed,nah i worked there a few years ago it was for minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,no king here just a lover of pizza sometimes they have a mexican pizza that is also pretty great
LifeProTips,not_removed,we just got an aldi too
LifeProTips,not_removed,they have a chicken fajita pizza every now and then that is amazinggggg
LifeProTips,not_removed,aldis has surprisingly amazing pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,im now but when i was a kid i lived off of aldis
LifeProTips,not_removed,they dont all skimp out on the cheese imo but the cheap brands almost universally do things like tombstone and what not generally have an appropriate amount of cheese buy the store brand frozen pizzas and youll be able to see sauce through the cheese once its done cooking but even extra cheese and veggies on these dont make them as good at the more premium frozen pizzas occasionally things like tombstone or red baron will be on sale for i always try and stock up when that happens its almost a full days worth of food for about each
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was born near the east coast but moved to west when i was young in england that is
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok when i was there mostly rural colorado though i didnt see a single one
LifeProTips,not_removed,love screamin sicilian
LifeProTips,not_removed,dunno what part of canada youre talking about but southern ontario dominos pizza is for a large for a large topping
LifeProTips,not_removed,their pan pizza is a surprising improvement over the regular pizza same as pizza hut theyre usually just a dollar or so more expensive but a drastic improvement in quality and personally i like them much more than frozen pizzas
LifeProTips,not_removed,so pick it up
LifeProTips,not_removed,he didnt include a works cited half credit
LifeProTips,not_removed,even though i wrote it i read it in

LifeProTips,not_removed,i just tell the wenches in the scullery to make me a perfect pizza i dont care how they do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,you think it costs to run an oven youre off by like orders of magnitude its much closer to ¢hour
LifeProTips,not_removed,that would make more sense and yeah if youre making multiple then even better i was just saying of running your oven on that temp for that long and if its summer time youre going to have to run the ac to offset the heat
LifeProTips,not_removed,on a scale of to bear im at an un
LifeProTips,not_removed,fixed the typo although i must say anybody that introduces me to a new tastier way to get excess calories into my body deserves in my opinion some level of royal title

LifeProTips,not_removed,hell yes papa murphys pizzas are so delicious they are topped with extremely fresh veggiestoppings and their crust is sooo yummy we like to serve pm at our childrens birthday parties or other lil family get togethers
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep essentially the rule is if its not ready to eat you can use ebt on it thats why if you live in a state with no food tax its tax free despite other pizza places charging you tax because its prepared already
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you bud im going in

LifeProTips,not_removed,yes i go out to lunch with my two employers quiet often and the conversations most of the time end up being about one of their friends so i just sit there on my phone and say nothing until one of em notices that im being unusually quiet and it all clicks lol it absolutely sucks pay attention kids keep everyone at the table included whenever possible its a great life skill

LifeProTips,not_removed,what were the many other reasons
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the thing you would think its common sense but really its not
LifeProTips,not_removed,so rude
LifeProTips,not_removed,we are talking about annoying motherfuckers that feel the need to talk to the whole room the barmates house is not a debating chamber so just chill and im talking to dave anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,well it all came down to the diference in what she said or promised and actually did she says she cares about you etc but none of her actions show that and she basically didnt do anything she promised she had let me down too many times so i am done with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont know why this got down voted some people i know who complain of the exact same thing are rude narcissistic and spoilt not everyone i know but a very good proportion i make a conscious effort not to exclude someone until maybe the third hour of them talking about themselves and giving no fucks about what anyone else has to say then they can hang out with a brick wall or a doormat for all i care
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks arsehole hope you never become a therapist
LifeProTips,not_removed,you werent paying enough also tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,so apparently spoilt is an adjective outside north america
LifeProTips,not_removed,spoilt is not a word whats wrong with you people
LifeProTips,not_removed,what do you mean paying enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,it is im from the uk
LifeProTips,not_removed,spoiled

LifeProTips,not_removed,imitation is the most sincere form of flattery they say maybe itll be something that brings the two of you together id be somewhat excited about the prospect of someone to collaborate with that said i have a twin and id get mad when she would do this for her i took comfort in knowing her interest wouldnt last long unless it was something she truly liked or was good at edit removed word
LifeProTips,not_removed,tone the hormones down and just appretiate what the other person contributes or ditch that buddy for being a copycat whatever works
LifeProTips,not_removed,tldr observe their reaction its hard to change or control how you feel but its possible to change or control what you do about how you feel thats the key watch your friend to see their reaction if you do bring up a competitive comment on the shared interest do they look like they want to ask you why are you being an asshole do they start to get into debating the plusses and minuses with you as if they enjoy it do they shut up or change the subject then if its mutually fun go ahead and feel and even act competitive if its not either control your reactions or run the risk of reducing the quality of the friendship
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel like its a matter of identity if you hold something dearly as an integral part of who you are it might feel like your friend is invading or stealing your identity for me i had to deal with how important of a role recognition plays if i didnt care about having others see me as the person who likes or does x then it shouldnt matter if someone else likes or does the same thing it helped me when i made the thing in question more personal and stopped caring if others viewed it as a defining characteristic for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats easy not being an yo
LifeProTips,not_removed,kick their ass jk idk i kind of enjoy the fact that my friends and i enjoy the same things gives us more th ings to do together look at it as a positive instead of a negative
LifeProTips,not_removed,stop being autistic
LifeProTips,not_removed,wear a ball gag and mask so they cant see youre crying
LifeProTips,not_removed,jus remember its all about you
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont take it too seriously have fun remember theyre into you already if youve gotten that far so dont try so hard stay hydrated i cant stress this enough be careful using intoxicants to ease the anxiety especially if youre worried about preforming it can make it worse if that doesnt work they make pills for that adult stores or even seedy gas stations carry them slightest stimulation is usually enough to trigger the effect of the pill have a good time
LifeProTips,not_removed,do lots of cocaine
LifeProTips,not_removed,nut min before the anticipated session will help a lot
LifeProTips,not_removed,even if someone is more experienced that you heshe will still have insecurities as well if youre worried about being good enough it means you already have a desire to please which goes a looooong way there are no exact rules preferences vary the key component of someone who is good in bed enthusiasm its crazy how far that alone will take you i dont mean like doing cheers and clapping hands and being like hercules hercules but just enjoying yourself with the task at hand with the machinery youre working with nothing makes someone feel more sexy than when they see how sexy you think they are if you get into it they get into it when you start to forget about your insecurities and feel relaxed thats when things get magical you got this
LifeProTips,not_removed,picture them naked works for interviewsspeeches right
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe try and imagineplay pretend that your partner is very anxious and that you are trying to rest their nerves and make them comfortable what would you do to quell their anxiety if you had someone trying to make you less nervous what would you want them to do the above comment about enthusiasm hits the nail on the head their post gives really good advice i have slept with enough people to tell you the guys in my case who have been the best sexual partners are the ones who a enjoy themselves b try be it successfully or unsuccessfully even if they are unsuccessful to start ive realised this is often down to nerveslack of experience and it almost always gets better in time though that really doesnt matter so long as they follow rule a c they clearly want to please mesatisfy me more than they want to satisfy themselves a guy simply going down on a girl is a good indicator of that and if theyre willing to spend a while down there it works even better cant speak for other sexualities though ironically i appreciate this rule c to such a degree that it usually makes me want to please them just as much so it becomes a sexual arms race which is fun in itself i really hope that helped and just some food for thought the most attractive men with the best assets physically are usually the laziest and worst in bed imo other people often feel the need to prove themselves in a way that makes them superior partners i stress that this is just my personal experience though
LifeProTips,not_removed,just drooling

LifeProTips,not_removed,one of my friends had to dump so he went and did it in my basement toilet an hour later he goes back down there comes back up immediately and just asks where our mop is turns out he clogged the toilet and it ended up over flowing with shit and shit water all over our basement that was a year ago and i still remind him every time hes over about the time he flooded my basement with shit

LifeProTips,not_removed,wouldnt it burn
LifeProTips,not_removed,forgot a keyword lasers iron the page quite nicely as long as your page isnt too floppy
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is tough i just recently lost one of my best friends and it sucked more than i could imagine somebody suffering what worked the best for me was talking about it and sharing memories and bonds with other friends of his it really made it feel like that i wasnt alone with this sadness it was a shared feeling that i attribute to us as humans finding comfort in socializing i couldnt really say much for some time but i eventually opened up and talked more about it the more i got to talk about it to others the prouder i felt that james was in my life i was so proud that i had a relation that deep and meaningful i actually started to cheer up a bit the tears will always be hard to fight i still tear up when i instinctively grab my phone to share something awesome that i did or to show him something that i want him to see its been a year or so now and i still do this but to me it just solidifies how much of a bond i was able to have with another person we used to talk a lot we were always sharing stories talking about cars and the what ifs of the universe its this kind of relationship however that allowed me to open up to become a better version of me dont forget that part its hard sometimes to overlook that when they are gone but they changed you for the better they may have left the world before you but just remember that the memories you have with them are your own special moments that shape who you are be happy that you were able to bond with them the way you did that no one else could and just know that the love you shared with them is love that you can share and carry with others as well your life still continues time will heal you but its not something that can switch overnight just focus on being peaceful and if you have to cry get it out eventually the tears will run drier and drier and youll be okay in sorry to hear about your friend i hope this helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,try to not think of them because it will make you sad also to help do that distract yourself by doing things you love andor like
LifeProTips,not_removed,learn that people will come and go from your life as you get older understand that each had a purpose in each others life and when that purpose was fulfilled you moved on appreciate the moments you had together and find new friends that can help you in your next steps in the end if you were truly best friends one visit a year will keep it going a few calls or text will help even through long distance the reality is that with all the tech available your best friends doesnt have to be next to you to vent talk share stories or advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,spend time with other friends whom you havent seen in a while pick up a new hobby or try things youve never done before its about keeping distracted getting to know others better and accepting that this person is no longer in your life its gonna suck hard core you will have to literally mentally slap yourself each time you think of your former best friend and refocus your thoughts it will get easier with time especially if you start getting closer to someone else
LifeProTips,not_removed,ummm i just memorize people that i care about that way when they die u just close your eyes and they are there
LifeProTips,not_removed,well said
LifeProTips,not_removed,good advice i like the buddhist saying life is a series of greetings and partings to reconcile the loss of someone whether through death or the ending of the relationship

LifeProTips,not_removed,how am i supposed to do that
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not what youre getting at but a lot of artists want you to create your own connections and meanings to their songs
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt ear transplants are expensive as are the ensuing legal costs from ear theft so make sure you choose a musician with an extensive discography so you wont get bored and have to get new ears if you want to listen to someone else
LifeProTips,not_removed,become a musician
LifeProTips,not_removed,the easiest way to do this is actually remove your own ears and then remove the ears of the artist whos music you want to enjoy this levels the playing field of listening
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats not how the artist intended their music to be heard fyi musicians rarely listen to their own music once they have released it
LifeProTips,not_removed,ear transplant surgery is definitely going to be the next big hit
LifeProTips,not_removed,the same way youd taste food with the tongue of the person who cooked it
LifeProTips,not_removed,is that like looking at art through the eyes of the artist

LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,just take it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i overthink constantly and what ive come to recognize is that i am overthinking and i will continue to think to reduce the thinking down to simple standards for instance i think this is doing this to this to that to this to that and reduce it gradually down to just this is doing this easier when intentionally meditating doable even when super busy
LifeProTips,not_removed,get in the habit of trusting your instinct overthinkers like us can actually internalize this process of rationalizing and pretty much skip the massive thought train that comes with it easier said than done sometimes but thats why we need to make trusting ourselves a habit you are probably not missing opportunities due to overthinking but you are probably overthinking the possibilities of those opportunities you passed upon if its looking too good to be true probably is etc just keep on trusting your gut and id bet that when a real opportunity arrives you will seize it instantly ps if you do miss out on something that turns out to be a good opportunity dont overthink that either underthinkers miss out on stuff all the time as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,try creating a routine for meditation it allows me to be more present which helps me make better decisions without overthinking it my life just seems to flow better than when i hadnt tried meditation
LifeProTips,not_removed,blaze a fatty then go on instinct
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprojectmanagementtriangle run around memorizing that for a week timecostquality timecost of course you can reasonably substitute for your overthinking of life opportunities timecostrisk for example then manage yourself like a company does you could buy stocks for usd in a small cap company for a discount atm well the maximum loss is usd if this thing implodes over night eg on the other hand perhaps a reasonable hope for near term gains is to in that stock you estimate the discount may be already lets say thats usd how long does it take you to earn money you need an hourly rate for your time to judge it say your time is always worth usdh based on your line of work assuming you dont want to pay someone professional to make a decision for you cost the risk of usd loss or the qualityproduct of usd gain must be in reasonable relation to the time you spend on the decision now eg researching the stock if you want to get out of the decision ahead then usd potential usdh is hours this indicates at hours analysis you already spent half your potential gain and all the safe discount offered to you if you think it through like that at the very beginning on how to make it and how long a decision willshould take you can decide not to analyse it and spend your time on something else or you can decide an hourly cutoff point where you need to toss it away because you cant profit otherwise at all or an hourly cut off point where a decision must be made based on all the data given at that time or you could decide not to spend any time at all but to pay a professional or you could decide to not spend any time at all buy the stock but also invest usd in stock options that insure you against the very worst losses in any case this triangle needs to make sense theres no point in taking huge amounts of time all morning in deciding riskless things what color shirt should i wear or spend more in time to analyze than gain to be expected etc other project management tools might help as well make a decision matrix make a riskopportunity table if you have several options judge them by important aspects this one is an a in reliability but a c for me in looks then calculate the overall score and go with the best
LifeProTips,not_removed,try listening to the meditation by vishen lakhiani if you try to do the type of meditation where you sit in silence your mind will probably go into a think spiral as mine does with this type it should be much easier for you to find a little peace for a few minutes starting the day off with this or another guided meditation could really help
LifeProTips,not_removed,shia labeoufs famous phrase sums it up pretty well actually

LifeProTips,not_removed,hey ive got the logo you requested this is a word document so
LifeProTips,not_removed,the worst is afterwards when a company has gone through a brand refresh and has this lovely stationary put together by a professional designer but instead uses something that carol the receptionist put together in word
LifeProTips,not_removed,rename the file and replace docx with zip open the zip file and you can extract the images
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh right my mistake sends pdf
LifeProTips,not_removed,its called being cheap
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds like the nonprofit i work with they have a pr person that is skilled in illustrator and stuff shes been struggling to get people to standardize she even changed the official company font to arial so everyone would have it and maybe use it instead of comic sans meanwhile some people dont know the difference between reply and reply all stuff like this happens multiple times a week hey everyone there are cookies in the break room soon followed by thanks cathy these look really good you know i love cookies or this gem please remember to sign up for the potluck if youre planning on having something to eat please bring something to share ok ok hard assi am bringing chili and bread sorry didnt mean to spell but it should have been class stupid spell check yeah i totally believe that excuse tldr making people use the right stuff is like
LifeProTips,not_removed,til thanks kind stranger but this usually still amounts to a shoddy logo and vectorimages are out of the question entirely
LifeProTips,not_removed,being cheap id understand but this company actually did shell out for the professional refresh with all the extras they just have no one interested in enforcing the branding that they paid some designer to develop
LifeProTips,not_removed,so true never thought about that
LifeProTips,not_removed,also if they just email you your password run and never look back reddit actually did this a few years ago because spez liked that feature then reddit got hacked and had a major security breach good on ya spez rfuckspez
LifeProTips,not_removed,the websites should never keep passwords in plain text that is just asking for trouble they should be salted and hashed edit a word
LifeProTips,not_removed,lightly seasoned

LifeProTips,not_removed,or take a sample to the store and let them match it
LifeProTips,not_removed,or save some leftover paint in mason jars
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless its been more than a few months or the particular area has direct sunlight then you might as well repaint the entire room as the color will never match perfectly
LifeProTips,not_removed,write the details on a small sticker inside the light switch take the cover off on the relevant walls
LifeProTips,not_removed,or as happened to me the paint manufacturer changes the formula so you can no longer get matching paint hoorah
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have lived in this house for years and i cant tell you how useful this has been most big companies here also give it a number that can be more useful than the name those bits of paint stored in jars degrade over time
LifeProTips,not_removed,as some one who worked in the homedepots paint department for over years never trust the stores system to save any information for you also its far safer to just pick from the colors they have availablecolor fan deck as the color match options are estimates and the formulas can change depending on volume of paintpint quart or gallon and the color will vary slightly also the pigments change every number of years too as the paint technology itself changes causing reformulations and your color match estimate to change and vary even more
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a great comment since collecting a sample to get the color exact can be a real pain i actually keep the original sample can in a drawer so i can take a picture of the barcode before returning to the store
LifeProTips,not_removed,beware as given even a fairly short space of time the colours will fade if it is a small patch then it is worthwhile i tend to keep the tins in the garage and write on them where i have painted a good sign it wont work is if you can barely prise the lid off and the paint smells weird and is separated

LifeProTips,not_removed,that wont help you when you need to describe the paint to the mixologist at the hardware warehouse unless of course you open the jars and paint a small piece of wood or drywall a day before you head to the store i retract my earlier statement on the grounds that i am illiterate
LifeProTips,not_removed,but op was talking about needing a small amount just to patch a chip
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry for some reason the text in ops post didnt expand and all i saw was the title youre right mason jars will do precisely what you said and solve ops problem

LifeProTips,not_removed,seems like that would scratch your floor
LifeProTips,not_removed,didnt have an issue with this i used it on linoleum tiling
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am pretty sure wood can get scratched
LifeProTips,not_removed,by a cloth and water hmmm id like to see this
LifeProTips,not_removed,pretty sure a lot of common debris can scratch wood floors if you are continually scraping them across the surface rather than sweeping first with a mopcloth and water you are collecting and concentrating the debris on the bottom of the mopcloth and then running this back and forth over the wood floors if you sweep first you are gently pushing the debris and removing it in a dustpan or with a vacuum when it gets collectedaccumulated from what ive seen wood floor care guides from flooring retailers and installers always say sweep first
LifeProTips,not_removed,also buy a few even larger bags so if the main one rips or leaks it makes it a lot easier to double bag it with a bag larger than the original
LifeProTips,not_removed,use a comb
LifeProTips,not_removed,wtf rip it out with your hand why is this a question
LifeProTips,not_removed,burn it and get a new brush
LifeProTips,not_removed,brushes also have a tendency to get oil build up so for those who dont understand why this is an issue its really hard to get a brush clean and to make sure that you arent brushing your clean hair with last weeks oil and last months dead hair
LifeProTips,not_removed,i once dealt with a brush so full you could hardly see the little balls on the ends of the bristles i took a pair of scissors and ran it up between the rows of bristles and cut the hair free it was easy to pull out with the handle of a rat tail comb then but still took a bit be careful doing this if your brush has soft bristles or fabric good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends on what kind of brush you use i have a boar bristle brush that i use a wire comb to remove the hair then i soak in a shallow dish with shampoo and water to remove the sebum buildup and small hairs i find the method to work well the most time consuming parts are waiting for it to soak then to dry
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use my blow dryer to push the hair out and towards the top of the bristles then i just pull them out
LifeProTips,not_removed,buy dark colors for your guest linens that way if they leave embarrassing stains on the towels or sheets you can plausibly fail to notice them which will make your guests feel better about their mishap and about staying with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,do not forget the towel
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know people who dont even have toilet paper in the house when inviting guests over needless to say thats a quick way to find out were not operating on the same level and quietly end the association with them
LifeProTips,not_removed,im pretty good with physics or i was not sure how to help you without more specifics do you write down all of your known variables before you begin the problem both the ones you have values for and the ones you do not
LifeProTips,not_removed,look for the universal conservation laws and newtons laws to fill in the missing unknown also be sure to break down vectors into components
LifeProTips,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but your question seems to be something like how do i maintain my concentration and attentiveness while studying the biggest one i think is probably just practice practice being conscious about how thorough you are read the questions slowly and out loud if theres a particular method you are working on go through it step by step and mentally check off the steps as you do them it might help to sort ofnarrate your problem solving as you go i thinkidk try to pay attention to what youre doing as you do it make yourself try a question at least or times from scratch before asking for help and read through your working out loud if possible before checking the the answer to see if you missed anything good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes i just like lose my attention in the middle of solving
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if it is a south park party
LifeProTips,not_removed,doing south park voices is bad mmmkayyyy
LifeProTips,not_removed,my girlfriend does the best cartman show them honey eh respect meh authoratah

LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a nice tip discouraging someone by mentioning how they could do or be better is helping them as opposed to letting them die stupid also it is part of life get over it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i eat at burger king every now and again and ive never ever had any of these experiences maybe a wrong order here and there but i mean just go back and have them fix it without being a dick about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,you sound nice lets hang out sometime
LifeProTips,not_removed,it sounds like you just had a bad experience at burger king its not that great at all but its not the worst place in the world the only thing worth getting is chicken fries
LifeProTips,not_removed,they could just be venting

LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre feeling better then that is a difference being made
LifeProTips,not_removed,same thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuckin whinnies
LifeProTips,not_removed,surprising whining in real life leads to people making arbitrary complaining whiles like yours on reddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes you can be getting shit from your boss at work shit happens not good to bottle that up inside just because you feel like youre bitching otherwise you can vent to practically anyone so i understand where youre coming from but depends on the situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,its really not venting can be very cathartic
LifeProTips,not_removed,you know whats even more cathartic actually fixing the problem instead of complaining about how the problem makes you feel and wasting other peoples precious time that could actually be used to solve more problems why do you need to spread shit aroud and talk about how it makes you feel if you know just shutting up and cleaning it is going to remedy the whole situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,glad im not friends with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,gald i dont have to put up with your bitching and complaining whenever a small problem comes up too
LifeProTips,not_removed,same thing when retail stores have people loading things for customers so youre gonna come home with me and unload it too right hahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaha

LifeProTips,not_removed,as a resident of flint mi remindme years
LifeProTips,not_removed,alternatively just have a allen wrench set at home
LifeProTips,not_removed,but we have like ten faucets should i buy an allen key for each one s why dont you just keep one set of allen keys in your toolbox
LifeProTips,not_removed,i received an allen key with each faucet i installed
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh well thats weird but that way it would work
LifeProTips,not_removed,get a raw milk container or soy almond goat whatever and keep your milk in that add some green or red food colouring as well no one will ever touch that shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,id personally throw a couple drops of blue food colouring in it people struggle with blue
LifeProTips,not_removed,make sure your boss kniws theft is theft i work in loss prevention someone stealing food from the fridge from their coworkers generally is also down with stealing from their employer a hidden camera is cheap and easy
LifeProTips,not_removed,step buy milk for home step drink milk step wash out container step fill with new milk step watch as they recoil in horror at the date on the side of the carton step enjoy your nice fresh milk
LifeProTips,not_removed,if its old milk they wont drink it if its laced with anything bad you dont want to drink it which defeats the purpose if it makes someone sick youre liable food coloring is the only idea here that might work and wont get you fired and do tell someone your boss or hr
LifeProTips,not_removed,put ground chilli peppers in it and let them drink it i guarantee they wont touch it again
LifeProTips,not_removed,buy a water bottle fill water bottle with daily milk put water bottle in a lunch box
LifeProTips,not_removed,put it in a buttermilk container
LifeProTips,not_removed,add cottage cheese
LifeProTips,not_removed,label it horse semen
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had someone drinking out of my liter pepsi at work i drank about a third then peed in it after i noticed the level had dropped i casually joked about it at lunch when someone questioned me i responded with well i would tell you its true but i wouldnt want to get sued
LifeProTips,not_removed,put some purge in it they wont drink it again guaranteed
LifeProTips,not_removed,laxatives and a label laxatives identify and punish the thief label makes it entirely their fault
LifeProTips,not_removed,put a very old milk in the fridge and wait i think after that no one will ever steal your milk again
LifeProTips,not_removed,take two milks spit on one and wrap in a note explaining how only one is safe to drink which one who knows
LifeProTips,not_removed,add some green food coloring
LifeProTips,not_removed,drink some and then spit it all back out drink it later let them taste your sweet juices
LifeProTips,not_removed,few drops of ridiculous hot sauce will get the job done dont use normal hot sauce go with one thats at least a a few million scoville unit
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is going to cost money but if you have your own office buy a minifridge and store the milk in that
LifeProTips,not_removed,put some green food coloring in it to make it look nasty
LifeProTips,not_removed,put it in a thermos and then in the fridge they are probably less likely to steal if they have to open and see what it is
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre willing to be a bit passive aggressive put your name on it and start marking the milk level on the jug each day if it is see through and date it the person will probably not want to leave evidence that any milk was stolen so they will avoid it
LifeProTips,not_removed,save a milk container with an expiration date from weeks ago wash and clean the container then pour your milk in there no one wants to drink expired milk
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is the etiquette like where you work any place ive ever worked milk in the fridge was always fair game people would take turns buying milk as it ran out
LifeProTips,not_removed,ipecac i saw a bully feed a soda to a kid at school he projectile vomited inside if minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,put your milk in a different container of some kind hopefully something they wont drink and if you want revenge put something nasty in the leftover milk container and put it where you normally put it
LifeProTips,not_removed,ask around and see if sharing it is office culture let it run out is it replaced put up a signup sheet on the fridge for hose turn it is to bring milk write cross out your name for the past week maybe even but a gallon and make it clear you are sharing and expect someone to pick up i bet everyone else knows who is doing it and will hopefully write his or her name on the sheet under yours or i have heard men with ulcers pay for unhomogenized goats milk you could just buy one and refill it they have to add crazy blatant labels to it it may put them off of it please follow up office pettiness is the best and post the revenge over at rpettyrevenge
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks i think ill see how hiding it works and if not ill be sure to post ha
LifeProTips,not_removed,instead of green or red food coloring which seems more artificial imo maybe make it black or purple food coloring in the milk i know that would put me off
LifeProTips,not_removed,just deploy the böring chip bag and they wont touch it
LifeProTips,not_removed,label it as goat milk a lot of people wont go near goats milk for a female especially one with kids try labeling it as breast milk
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked with a guy who wrote god says stealing is a sin on everything he put in the fridge i didnt steal any of his cokes but i stole the idea and its surprisingly effective i dont know if its the threat of eternal damnation or if the writing eliminates any oops i thought that was mine accidents but it works very well if you have an office buy a it is incredibly satisfying to be able to reach back and grab a cold drink on a hot day without leaving your chair you can put them in most cubicles too but you wont get the same level of theft protection put a microwave oven on top of it and youll never wait for the guy who starts heating his smart ones meal and then walks away
LifeProTips,not_removed,brilliant
LifeProTips,not_removed,here luke have some blue milk
LifeProTips,not_removed,this if you bring a gallon write your name on it so its clear who owns it and gets rid of the oh i thought it was a shared it also gives whoever wants some milk the opportunity to go hey megz i seen you had a gallon do you mind if i grab a glass or a bowl for some cereal i know i would get upset if people took it but honestly wouldnt say no if someone asked as long as it was an occassional thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,better yet re label it as daves breast milk dont do it if your boss name is dave
LifeProTips,not_removed,it wouldnt stop them
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i didnt work there i would plus ive only just started might be obvious
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a very underrated idea a water bottle you cant see through would be even better
LifeProTips,not_removed,that might just encourage people to steal it depending on where you work
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre winning so far might skip the label
LifeProTips,not_removed,on that not maybe some bits of muffin or something so it looks like epic backwash
LifeProTips,not_removed,interesting may try this one i also really needed the link to the small fridge for reference much appreciated
LifeProTips,not_removed,threat of eternal damnation yes and for everyone else the threat of having to sit through a sermon on the subject of stealing coworkers food
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel sick already
LifeProTips,not_removed,this sounds like a past tifu
LifeProTips,not_removed,well best would be to teach them some manners get some bad milk in not transparent package or put in some laxative medicine it depends on who is stealing your milk just a guy who thinks that they share all food or an asshole so you might need to just talk or get ready for war also if that coworker has any senses you could start every new milk package by opening it and drinking like an animal straight out of package making sure people see you you could also buy some lunchbox with a lock
LifeProTips,not_removed,gone off milk then tough situation maybe just mentioning it to the culprit would help or eat their lunch congrats on the new job hope it goes well
LifeProTips,not_removed,no its innocent and good especially because you are new this is the way you drink it stealing bastards
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youve only just started it might be that milk in the fridge is shared milk is cheap and goes off quickly quicker than one person will get through before it goes off unless you drink insane amounts of coffee
LifeProTips,not_removed,label is important with a label its someone stole my milk without a label its i poisoned milk and put it in a public space
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,push come to shove you could claim youre having issues with your bowels and that you add laxatives to your milk to help
LifeProTips,not_removed,try this
LifeProTips,not_removed,then you probably shouldnt have drank daves breast milk
LifeProTips,not_removed,booby trapping property to deter thieves can get you in serious legal trouble
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha its actually a really tricky situation ive had it at uni and just ended up arguing with people cant really do that here cheers id prefer to have milk with my tea though aha
LifeProTips,not_removed,god damn that was the no suggestion
LifeProTips,not_removed,ps label request
LifeProTips,not_removed,not really no one will know its booby trapped just dont be a retard and dont put serious drugs in it as i said just put in some laxative or get milk that is already going bad both ways its gonna be natural consequences of eating bad food heshe just needs to spend one day on the toilet or to see that your food might be bad there is times more serious consequences to people stealing my foodthings and people who will try to put any of the consequences on me
LifeProTips,not_removed,final suggestion milk that doesnt need to be refrigerated if you have a desk keep it there if not get small sachetspackets of it so no one else has access
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are not selling the milk you have it there because you feel constipated nobody needs to know that its your milk
LifeProTips,not_removed,if someone can prove he got sick from your laxativelaced food you could face a battery charge it is likely that in the eyes of the law your booby trap is a more severe offense than his petty larceny
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah if i have to its not the same though plus i like nesquik
LifeProTips,not_removed,not really first good luck trying to prove that the milk that you stole wasnt just out of date and for the last time dont put in deathly poison just some simple laxative medicine no one gets sick from it and the last point if the system would be able to find any prove that my milk had some laxative because i had trouble pooping and still would go after me then big boom or godlike streak inc what else to do if system is retarded as i always said and said here on reddit many times life today is not perfect it is still very much in progress of getting fixed by eliminating bad people and corruption and you dont have to take laws seriously it is just somebody sucky opinion you must fight for your own believes and truth

LifeProTips,not_removed,at my office there are a few quiet rooms i can sit in if you dont have that just find a conference room
LifeProTips,not_removed,coming from seven years at a tim hortons i know how you feel about maintaining focus with constant rush and customer interaction in any line of work organization and structure will streamline your workload and make it easier to perform your duties as for focus accuracy speed and service no matter what task you have in front of you fulfill those three objectives do it fast but do it well and do it with a smile just keep those in mind and focus on those your performance will improve guaranteed
LifeProTips,not_removed,whenever im overwhelmed by the work pressure i focus on my breath try taking a deep breath and then exhale slowly repeat fiveten times concentrate on what youre doing hope this helps you just like it has always helped me
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked in a pretty busy manhattan kitchen a few years back all i had was passion a buttload of theory from countless cooking books and a creative mind i lacked practical skills mostly in speed i dont know what your job is so ill try to keep it vague first all things get easier with practice if youre in a low stress time period you can do two things try to maximize your efficiency and speed proper technique can help shave off time what youre doing that can build up and give you the room you need to breathe when the rush comes you can also imagine that its a busy rush and try to accomplish your task recreate the environment in which you begin to blank out and do the task itll help desensitize you to the feeling and should also help you with your speed be aware of whats going on always be one step ahead you can make some preparations in advance so youre not running all over the place if you see a disaster waiting to happen prepare contingencies there are times where you get swamped with a large task for example two large families come in to eat in the restaurant during a lunch rush and the tickets wont stop the task might seem insurmountable and technique and speed wont cut it in my experience its best to break down your task into easy to follow objectives look at your goals look at what tasks need to be done first look at what you can multitask break each apart and make a battle plan to fall back on that way if you do blank out you can remind yourself oh yeah im on step out of etc and my biggest advice i can give to you is to breathe breathe breathe breathe in through the nose out through mouth let your diaphragm fill out and dont let your chest puff up when you dont breathe your hands make mistakes your hands make mistakes the more you fall behind give yourself those seconds to clear your mind review the battle plan and go
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds like you do not handle pressure well first a question is it just work that you fall apart when being rushed or all things for me breathing exercises work great if you need to pause plan a few steps ahead its far easier to make up seconds once then seconds after each step and when dealing with angry customers dont take anything to heart
LifeProTips,not_removed,my advice would be if youre in a task oriented job work on one thing at a time keeping a collective list as a reminder physical or just in your head if its customer facing focus on one customer at a time and break down those interactions into each of the steps to finish the transaction eg greet ask for customer card scan items pack items give total price take payment farewell or something to that effect when i was customer facing and it got busy i just had to make myself focus on getting through one customer at a time and remind myself the overall number of customers etc wasnt something i could control but the speed of that current transaction was under my control something like scanning items in the order i would pack them was always beneficial that way it pretty much only took one process of scan and pack to complete
LifeProTips,not_removed,noise cancelling headphones or even regular headphonesearbuds and listen to music when i do that and someone tries to interrupt me i brusquely say yea whats up not with attitude or meanness usually they realize im busy sometimes they even ask if im busy and you just gotta say yes yes i need to finish this bonus having the headphones on is an excuse for me to ignore them when they talk even if i can hear them

LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt when storing cash money in something like a jar always put smaller less valuable bills on top and higher value ones near the bottom as a thief i would just take the whole jar unless you mean so that you avoid picking at it and taking money out
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if the jar is almost full and i have a larger denomination bill to put in do i need to dump out the jar and then put it all back in
LifeProTips,not_removed,then you should look at investing options glass jar doesnt give interest
LifeProTips,not_removed,where do i get that discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,setting time aside for discipline makes for a much less stressful environment life is not always about enjoyment at every moment
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you discipline yourself you train oneself to do something in a controlled and habitual way motivation is totally different the general desire or willingness of someone to do something to discipline yourself you have to be motivated you discipline yourself to wake up at everyday by in some capacity becoming motivated to do so this can be work health spiritual whatever has nothing inherently to do with mental or emotional as some have said someone else disciplines you by negative feedback such as shouting which causes you to be motivated to discipline yourself to avoid the negative feedback see drill instructors or teachers with the red pen this lpt doesnt make any sense in terms of vocabulary i think they mean to make it a habit to just do what must be done instead of waiting until you want to do it which is good advice and i thought was common sense but maybe a lot of people procrastinate waiting for motivation instead of just getting to work shrug edit tldr motivation creates discipline if youre motivated to change your poor work habits use discipline then youll be able to change your habits to do work even when you dont want to do work
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont post bullshit abstract advice as lpts saves our time from reading it

LifeProTips,not_removed,if you cant motivate yourself to do something try just doing it
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a recording artist and i find that if i have to force itits not even worth it theres no way to do good work if youre not into it or arent enjoying yourself it just ends up being shit now when it comes to work work ya know stacking boxes paperwork etc that stuff you can accomplish just as competently whether youre into it or not but yeah whenever it feels like work i dont do it and then i search for something different i can do thats productive and that i at least kinda feel like doing
LifeProTips,not_removed,trying to embrace this right now starting small with something simple like washing my face every day went shopping tonight so next is going to be regulating my diet a bit do it because its good for you not for immediate enjoyment type thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,there are two kinds of people in here for one kind this doesnt make sense and for the other it does for one kind this advice works and for the other it doesnt the reason is simple the concept of discipline is a trick you play on your mind to create motivation there is no such thing as discipline there are only factors that make you do something and factors that stop you from doing somethingmake you do something else more this is called motivation when you create this concept of discipline what youre actually doing is saying im good enough to do this even though i do not like to do itlike to do something else more this creates an additional factor for making you do something if you now not do this thing you have to admit to yourself i lack disciplinei wasnt good enough which is enough of a pain for some to tip motivation in the favor of doing the task but for others it is not the pain of admitting i lack disciplinei wasnt good enough is not higher than the pain of the task itself this is why you get these contrasting opinions in this thread for some this trick with discipline works for others it doesnt the actual solution is to create as many factors that make you do something as possible use discipline but also remind yourself what ultimate benefit you gain from this activity make it harder for yourself to do those other things that you want to do more turn off the phone unplug the internet if its some abstract goal come up with a concrete first step if its boring create some funny minigame for additional challenge i imagine im a giant monster creating massive destruction when i weed the garden for example tell someone about what you will do and tell them to ask you later if you did it make it a habit by doing it always at a specific time make it a competition compete against your previous time reward yourself after you started doing the task or finished it if finishing is your problem watch a motivational video basically httpiimgurcomzpijxuojpg until you applied enough so that you have enough motiviation to do the task you want to do if you want to read more about this i would suggest you read for a summary see
LifeProTips,not_removed,this literally makes no sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,so basically have discipline and youll have discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,what are you on about intrinsic motivation is enjoyment itself enjoying running and the nature drives you to do the activity youre right there no enjoyment is lower motivation extrinsic motivation however such as rewards praises fame etc do in fact increase the behavior productivity of the task
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont you need motivation to be disciplined
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup thats it the lpt so shitty that i unsubscribe
LifeProTips,not_removed,discipline relies on willpower many scientists believe that willpower is limited
LifeProTips,not_removed,i needed to hear this two weeks ago i still dont have money for rent but i cant be bothered to go work arg
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah but i just dont have the motivation for discipline rn
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel like theres a difference between largescale motivation eg i want to write a book versus smallscale motivation eg i want to sit down and write a chapter today you definitely need largescale motivation no matter what no amount of discipline is going to get you to a goal you arent motivated to achieve at least not with your sanity intact however the smallscale motivation of sitting down and writing at any one time is not necessary if you can replace it with discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,not the same experience for everyone discipline takes enormous focus for me i spend over half my energy forcing myself to stay at the desk for the rest of the day sometimes it starts at hour four sometimes at hour nine when im motivated and the project is going the way i need it to i go oh shit its i should get home
LifeProTips,not_removed,youll also get drained of energy by doing something you dont want to do
LifeProTips,not_removed,discipline is good but so are podcasts helps make any task more enjoyable and more mindless
LifeProTips,not_removed,everyone must choose one of two pains pain of discipline or pain of regret
LifeProTips,not_removed,here is how i get shit done i just do it i dont give myself the option
LifeProTips,not_removed,what does that even mean just grin and bare it i dont get it
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt use motivation to build a habit
LifeProTips,not_removed,you only need discipline if you dont actually believe you must do that thing no one needs discipline to run out of the burning house or study the last night before the exam i think its helpful to analyse why you dont think its really important to do what you have to do maybe you dont actually think that its worth the effort
LifeProTips,not_removed,man what kinda pro tip is this thats like saying if you suck try being better its not the same
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe i misunderstand what people mean by motivation but i dont see how anything can be done without motivation if youre doing anything you must be motivated for the reward in some fashion even if you dont enjoy the task
LifeProTips,not_removed,i can see that working for some things but not necessarily optimal for all when it comes to learning having fun helps lock it in memory better you cant will yourself to just memorize something or i should say you can but it takes a lot more effort than to just gamify the task to lock it into memory deeper and quicker to have discipline to wake up a half hour earlier than you have to is better than simple motivation you can just will yourself to do it until it becomes habit so while i think discipline has its place it shouldnt be the only tool in the box
LifeProTips,not_removed,tell that to my gym membership
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant say i have ever tried to make myself enjoy a task in order to complete it is that what most people are doing ive spent a lot my life doing things that i dont particularly enjoy whether its homework chores or working a full time job i do the things because if i dont the consequences will be bad for me if im unmotivated to do a task then i just have to make myself do it anyway is that what this lpt is no shit otherwise id spend all my time playing video games and sleeping
LifeProTips,not_removed,motivation is fleeting discipline is eternal
LifeProTips,not_removed,discipline can also help you enjoy the task over time but trying to make it more enjoyable as you go starting it is one thing being creative while maintining it is another
LifeProTips,not_removed,i saw this post at the exact time i needed to bless you reddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,heres my tip listen to music while you are working
LifeProTips,not_removed,til i admire disciplined people
LifeProTips,not_removed,except im too lenient with myself see with anything i do i need consequences that doesnt mean negative necessarily in fact the negative consequences usually dont work on me im in uni and ive failed many classes so obviously i dont respond to that but if i think i have a shot at something like if i work out then ill lose pounds ill do it most of the time however the reward is either impossible to achieve or i just lose interest which is why i wont keep up like say with studying i saw improvement so i studied more suddenly i realized everyone else was doing better because they were cheating so i got discouraged and started to see that my hardwork would never amount to anything so i lost all that motivation and self discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,and many times the motivation kicks in after youve pushed through the beginning with discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,enjoyment requires no energy
LifeProTips,not_removed,tldr do the things you have to do
LifeProTips,not_removed,when u dont wanna do it just do it anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,seriously came to this realization hours ago was trying to tell myself eh come on its just a paper its not that bad even though i know how awful i am at writing then i just thought i need to put in hard work to accomplish something this is hard work
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the only lpt that i can apply to right now from personal experience this is something you need to train yourself in not just learn it
LifeProTips,not_removed,this applies to the gym studies and work
LifeProTips,not_removed,for those saying you need motivation for discipline to occur or they are the same thing merely a play on words i disagree very often do i have motivation to do what i need to do when its not there discipline sets in and it generally feels like a grind but it stills gets done this discipline helps to set habits taking off the effort required to perform although with the presence of motivatation with the habit set by discipline then peak performance can be achieved in the task but i never lean on motivation to complete a task mainly habit formed from lengthy discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,focus on the end result not the during or process only way this type of shit works
LifeProTips,not_removed,false motivation is better than no motivation
LifeProTips,not_removed,easier said than done
LifeProTips,not_removed,love seeing a wendler quote in a nonfitness subreddit hes a huge influence on my journey through fitnesslifting immediately thought of his discipline over motivation shirts when i saw this post
LifeProTips,not_removed,the day is short the work is great the workers are lazy but the reward is great and the master of the house is knocking at your door it is not upon you to finish the work but neither are you free to desist from it
LifeProTips,not_removed,rshittylifeprotips
LifeProTips,not_removed,cool but when youre in a job with a manager that doesnt care to give you meaningful work its hard to find discipline to do it

LifeProTips,not_removed,have add getting disciplined is so difficult and draining but thanks for the advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,this isnt exactly a helpful lpt how does one just do it with discipline i think mark mansons article your goals are overrated is a great guide to accomplishing the essence of this lpt after years of struggling with my weight im finally on the right path because of that article ive already lost lbs since just before last thanksgiving by creating healthier habits i started with no sodas then basically no treats special occasions only added fruit as a regular part of my diet and then better portions i havent even added the habit of working out yet baby steps maybe even more impressive of a new habit i actually floss my teeth twice a day now like i force myself to get back out of bed to do it if i forgot how many people know they should floss daily but only do it right before going to the dentist anyways check it out legit changed my life and im just getting started httpsmarkmansonnetgoals
LifeProTips,not_removed,and now i feel bad letting my gf squat those by herself yesterday but thats right discipline goes a long way but helps a lot when youre not motivated or having fun
LifeProTips,not_removed,just do something action is as often the cause of motivation as the result of it
LifeProTips,not_removed,me for physics always requires discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks for this post i read it this morning at am while laying in bed contemplating getting up or sleeping for another hour this post got me up and swinging the kettlebell
LifeProTips,not_removed,the way i look at discipline especially when its an undesirable task is to remember that that feeling of hating whatever you are doing will eventually pass remember it always ends at some point either when the task is done or when you forget you hate what youre doing
LifeProTips,not_removed,motivation doesnt do shitdiscipline doesif you dont do something you wanted to ask your friend to spank you real hard
LifeProTips,not_removed,another great benefit of discipline is the guilt that comes with it if you always depend on being motivated to work or exercise or whatever its easy the chalk not doing it up to lack of motivation and move on if you start doing those things out of discipline youll soon feel the the onus of actually doing them falls entirely on you not doing them isnt because you dont have some vague motivation but because you personally were undisciplined and let yourself down from experience knowing youre going to feel guilty later is somewhat ironically a great motivator even when going for a run of doing some crappy work sucks now at least ill be done with it instead of spending hours longer than it would have taken feeling guilty about not
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is vital for freelancing sometimes i hear i wish i wers motivated to be an artist for hire when in reality you need discipline regardless of how tired i am or how much i dont feel like it i sit down in front of my workstation and draw if i waited for any time i was motivated by inspiration then id never get my bills paid for me i set quotas and milestones i have images to complete in two weeks ok let me set up a time frame to have certain stages completed and off to the client
LifeProTips,not_removed,motivation and discipline are not mutually exclusive i would argue that both are important in reaching your goals motivation comes from the big picture the end goal discipline is often needed to put in the work required to reach the goal
LifeProTips,not_removed,i totally agree with this sentiment but i add the caveat that there are some cognitive levels that can only be reached when motivated through discipline you can carry out any activity youve done before again but to create something new like a painting song algorithm whatever you need to be motivated
LifeProTips,not_removed,wrong habit beats everything
LifeProTips,not_removed,motivation does not require that you enjoy the task either
LifeProTips,not_removed,just do it with discipline kinda has the same ring to it as just get over your depression or just stop being poor
LifeProTips,not_removed,in some cases definitely not all but in a lot of them my line of work allows that you can take initiative and bend the rules until you like the task or if you dont really like it but you know that youll be able to fuck with that someone who gave you the task in a subtle way it takes off the stress and makes the task a lot more fun
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my case forcing myself builds resentment instead of discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,solid advice op and some that i use daily due to the fact that i hate my job
LifeProTips,not_removed,well and im not being sarcastic pet help no matter what else i have to do i must feed the cats and change the water daily
LifeProTips,not_removed,shit like this is why this sub is becoming a joke this particular lpt being basically facing something difficult get the fuck over it lpt inhale and exhale to lengthen your lifespan as oxygen is needed for you to live lpt cant pick up something because youre holding something already use your other hand lpt insert other simple and obvious shit here in an overly discript manner since actually helpful things are not allowed
LifeProTips,not_removed,discipline is not about forcing yourself to do something so that youre doing it while absolutely hating yourself its about setting aside your emotional attitude about the task and just doing the task without any extreme emotional turmoil make it a habit to notice when you dont feel like doing something huh look that im feeling this aversion to this task then take a deep breath or and just do it this is easier said than done but with practice you can get much better
LifeProTips,not_removed,you know how you can only do things when you like something i like dd and i like being a dm but world building thinking of story hooks and so on are the things i dread im still procrastinating doing it right now my game is in hours and i still feel like ehhhhhhh i dont feel like it i really wish discipline would come into play here
LifeProTips,not_removed,triathlete here its all discipline nobody enjoys jumping in a pool at and swimming for two hours then running on lunch hour and after kids in bed riding on trainer for two hours then there are the weekends once again in pool at hour bike on one day and a run the next some where in there is husband and dad time when i started dating my new bride a couple years ago she actually did research on dating triathletes we are always busy always tired and always hungry there are countless articles on how to date a triathlete i believe that there has been only one world champion kona that was married when they won she was married to the guy who took third in mens division where does the discipline come from about years ago i saw my dad with his shirt off scared the hell out of me been trying hours a week ever since
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt just fucking do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,start lifting weights and hold yourself accountable
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is why i am mgtow use discipline to abstain from women even if i desire women
LifeProTips,not_removed,comes to mind her is great
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt life sucks eat shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,you dont need discipline you can use your laziness discipline compromises focus anyway if you have to actively resist a temptation its easy to stay on course since we are creatures of habit but we dont like change its a temporary disruption that makes people feel stressed and that can be an unpleasant feeling what you do is make the new habit easier to accomplish than the old habit by creating obstacles to the old way and clear the path for the new habit essentially you are minimizing stress and using natural lazy tendencies to help steer you in other words have healthy meals preprepared with you for lunch if you want to stay on course with your diet hide the video game and tv controller in another room and keep a stack of books around if you want to study or read more put the right things within reach and the wrong things out of reach convenience is our greatest motivator thats how lame tv shows last years before being cancelled they have good lead in and people are too lazy to change the channel much of the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you really cannot find motivation for a task do it with discipline what this doesnt make sense if you have discipline then you wouldnt be trying to do anything with motivation in mind in the first place discipline takes over your instinct to do anything assuming you have it so you wouldnt even consider motivation as factor at that point this lpt is shitty because youve regurgitated something youve read on the internet and clearly havent applied it in real life
LifeProTips,not_removed,motivation is something you have to wait for discipline comes from within
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt unlike motivation discipline does not require that you enjoy the task when you really cannot find motivation for a task do it with discipline youll save energy on trying to make yourself enjoy the task or alternatively make a gamechallenge out of said chore by concentrating on finding methodologies which mean it doesnt need to be done quite so often andor can be done in a more efficientlyeffective way
LifeProTips,not_removed,absence of motivation is just an excuse for procrastinating
LifeProTips,not_removed,might seem harsh but every time i hear someone complain about struggling with a task due to lack of motivation i think to myself that they ought to grow up if youre an adult you should have replaced motivation with discipline long ago motivation is nice but if you need it to do your best on something you are lacking a pretty basic skill
LifeProTips,not_removed,unlike motivation discipline does not require that you enjoy the task says who
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah this lpt is kinda dumb it should say discipline leads to motivation

LifeProTips,not_removed,get a shitty job or task learn to do it anyway while you die slowly on the inside to the point you dont care at one point you will just do it on auto with no emotions or pain after a while you will find a weird sense of peace or enjoyment that is in it but at the end of the day you satisfied that you did it and will make you have more selfrespect for yourself

LifeProTips,not_removed,you motivate yourself to find it
LifeProTips,not_removed,put emphasis on why youre doing the task work because you need money to eat housework because you dont want to live like an animal i usually take some down time from fun projects if im not feeling motivated because the reason for those is enjoyment but if im close to finishing a project i may power through because i enjoy a finished item if theres no reason that drives your task maybe dont do it

LifeProTips,not_removed,schedule it every night at i am going to run for minutes set an alarm to remind you keep your shoes somewhere convenient make this as painless as possible but when that alarm goes off you do what you said its no different that going to work every morning set your alarm get up and go were not terribly motivated to go in every morning but we do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,do it shialabouf

LifeProTips,not_removed,i know youre kidding but most people cant even tell you what discipline is
LifeProTips,not_removed,he is going to home
LifeProTips,not_removed,just do it nike is right
LifeProTips,not_removed,the military
LifeProTips,not_removed,right my first thought to this
LifeProTips,not_removed,a video that may actually help
LifeProTips,not_removed,you wait until you have a day only until the deadline
LifeProTips,not_removed,its probably easiest to get when youre kind of eased into it for example with sports in a team you dont want to let your team down so whether or not you go training on a particular day doesnt really depend on you how you feel if you want to or not if you dont want to let your team down in the long term you have to go so you go its the same with exercises there is no point in half assing them youre already spending your time in an unpleasant way maybe youd rather be somewhere else but right then youre still stuck doing your exercise might as well do them properly the trick is to see getting up in the morning and starting the exercise with the same thought in mind you might not want to but if you want to achieve something you kind of have to leave the bed at some point might as well get it with earlier can be anything not just sports but its easier in a group where other people also kinda sorta stick to a plan and a goal
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you know what it is you need to do then shut your mind off and just start the act if you dont do so youre mind will possibly contemplate every excuse not to do said act nike got it right just do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats why this advice is nonsense discipline is when you come up with a system to overcome a weakness for example i tend to sit around and be lazy when i wake up so i set my alarm to an hour earlier so i wont be late for work thats discipline i was not keeping up with chores around the house and i hate scrubbing toilets so i hired a maid for twice a month that is also discipline discipline in the best sense of the word could mean that you develop a new habit and learn to keep doing it usually that doesnt work if were talking about a real weakness what op is saying is that instead of coming up with a system to overcome your weakness you should just knock it off
LifeProTips,not_removed,you just gotta do it every day until it becomes a habit
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of the best way to build discipline is to force yourself to do tasks you dont want to everyday you dont have to review your taxes everyday you can simply use your nondominant hand every now and then do some household maintenance exercise
LifeProTips,not_removed,force yourself to do it and after a while it will become normal to do that task where you dont even think about doing it
LifeProTips,not_removed,all these debbie downers i agree with this lpt wholeheartedly its easy to feel negativity when faced with something that would require motivationdiscipline but its easier to just feel neutrality to not expect or wait for it to feel enjoyable but also not letting it be negative just do it regardless of emotion its easier
LifeProTips,not_removed,setting time aside for discipline yeah but it takes discipline to set aside time for discipline hence this being a shit piece of advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you build discipline and find confidence in its process it becomes liberating and peaceful and therefore enjoyable in some sense please dont go your life thinking that you can only enjoy in small quantities its all about perspective
LifeProTips,not_removed,do people not just sit down and do their shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,this reminds me of my favorite line from albert camus one must imagine sisyphus happy also of this jocko willink video
LifeProTips,not_removed,or discipline requires some form of motivation even if its just the smallest thought of i must wake up at to be successful then ya just set it and forget it
LifeProTips,not_removed,its the old dont set targets set habits where you dont aim to go to the gym but aim to get fit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont know if you dont know the subject in discourse or is trying to be a smartass but this is just arguing semantics your definition of motivation is the thing that gives people reasons to consciously act which is pretty fucking useless to talk about since every voluntary action need a reason in fact its defined that way the motivation that op mentioned means inspiration or the fire that went out within minutes after we put our hands in the dirt
LifeProTips,not_removed,im getting riamverysmart vibes but your logic is sound indeed
LifeProTips,not_removed,actually this is a pretty good lpt example being going to the gym some people only go when hyped but the ones that have been consistent for years dont go when motivated they just go thats discipline not motivation true for many things in life
LifeProTips,not_removed,aaand the real lpt as usual is in the comments
LifeProTips,not_removed,speaking about saving time the irony is that this was the most unhelpful comment ive read on here so far and now mine will likely be the most unhelpful comment for the next guy to come along
LifeProTips,not_removed,but youre on reddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,discipline get back to your homework you ingrate
LifeProTips,not_removed,this all has to be a joke right all you needed is some fuck to say hey if you dont feel like doing it do it anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,but in reality it is the best advice perform action x hinges on one thing actually doing the thing action x doesnt give a fuck whether or not youre motivated to do it or how much time youve spent wasted psyching yourself up for it without results motivation is useless and discipline implicitly does not exist i disagree with the notion that you have to be motivated to exercise discipline maybe not semantically but definitely in spirit the fact is that a significant segment of soft motherfuckers are out there saying they just have to find the motivation before starting a task this is a bullshit sidestepping tactic that puts the onus for their failure to act on some ethereal doublespeak concept that they can comfortably shelve for now and return to at a later time spoiler they probably wont discipline on the other hand cuts through that kind of garbagecan thinking very nicely discipline calls on you to muster your grit admit you dont want to do the thing and do the thing anyway with only the understanding that the thing must be done to drive you
LifeProTips,not_removed,you master discipline to execute all the nonmeaningful requirements of life laundry dishes taxes so you can maximize your time and mental energy to embrace the meaningful things in life music for you with unencumbered passion
LifeProTips,not_removed,i understand the sentiment but everybodys different i find that sometimes creative energies will magically appear when theyre desperately needed billy strayhorn once said that most of his great works were completed to meet a deadline
LifeProTips,not_removed,but one could certain find examples in music of forcing it too the little things that lead to big things i doubt you will find any truly great guitarist who only ever practiced when he felt like it same for playing great shows but showing up to sound check if you feel like it you have to do the stuff you have to do in order to do what you want to do
LifeProTips,not_removed,im going to give some of these a try thanks for taking the time to write this comment i happen to fall in the latter category it is far past the time for a change
LifeProTips,not_removed,no this literally makes sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,it makes a lot of sense source studying for analysis and linear algebra finals right now no motivation still do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,im getting some extrinsic motivation from your username
LifeProTips,not_removed,take motivation as being excited to accomplish a task discipline as knowing a task needs to be done and completing it regardless of attitude motivation is getting psyched for your workout but on days you dont feel it discipline takes over and says you dont have to like it but you need to go and put in work
LifeProTips,not_removed,arent they one and the same when talking about doing a task s i really dont get this
LifeProTips,not_removed,straw that broke the camels back seriously though these broad nonspecific posts really are putting me off this sub id have to agree op needs to better explain what he means and how to do it at the moment this post is just like saying lpt if you struggle being happy just be cheery
LifeProTips,not_removed,really i had heard that will power is only limited in people who believe that will power is limited i havent read any studies myself though
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wouldnt call willpower limited but it can be exercised the mental ability to make yourself do things you dont feel like doing does actually seem to improve when you consistently use it
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you have homeworkdeadline etc instead of waiting for the moment you feel like doing homework just make sure you have time and do it you probably wouldnt have done it before the last night before deadline and wouldve stressed the whole time until it getting nothing done
LifeProTips,not_removed,motivation doesnt last how many people start something and then stop even though they say they enjoy it they dont feel like doing it any more it doesnt matter what they benefit of doing it was doing it anyway when things arent easy because of motivation is the point of the lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,its okay friendo i understand what helped me was trying to push the limits bit by bit okay i can do x how about i try and do one tiny extra thing it wont do miracles but you might be able to push your limits a little bit i agree that discipline doesnt mean shit though been there done that i was a hundred percent convinced it needed to happen but my other part said dont feel like it am sad upset dont think its important so nah
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah yes the classic this doesnt apply to me so its wrong no shit an internet forum wont help you if youre mental ill go see a professional
LifeProTips,not_removed,theyre totally using the word like it means feeling like doing this thing discipline is just sacrificing pleasure for longterm satisfaction its still motivation just in a more desirable form
LifeProTips,not_removed,other way around if you get motivated to change your habits you will discipline yourself into new ones without motivation you will never be disciplined
LifeProTips,not_removed,i said packs a day timmie get back out there and show cancer whos bitch you are

LifeProTips,not_removed,we are what we do not what we thinkfeel
LifeProTips,not_removed,amp does nothing for me unfortunately i take it to get to normal and even then its not really normal yay ms
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats not true discipline is the requirement that you place on yourself to do something motivation is the urge that drives you to do something that you follow one is mental the other is emotional i wont go on but there are some real differences between them that makes the advice sound
LifeProTips,not_removed,you have the discipline to go to the work you hate every single day you do your work the best you can too because thats what you have to do you are not motivated you are disciplined
LifeProTips,not_removed,in a broad way i agree with you if you have zero motivation discipline is impossible if you need to discipline yourself to get through a task you must believe there is a point in completing the task and the point serves as your motivation if doing a task will change nothing in the future whatsoever or you believe it will change nothing in the future whatsoever then you simply will not do it theres no point in telling a suicidal person to discipline themselves to get some exercise if they truly believe there is no point in living but thats the extreme i think in a narrower way though its possible to have discipline without positive motivation in the moment ie you can do something you dont feel like doing when your motivation is that you know there will be positive consequences or a mitigation of negative consequences in the future of you getting it done
LifeProTips,not_removed,nonsense waiting for motivation is a copout by the undisciplined

LifeProTips,not_removed,its advice not zeroefforthighreturnsmagic
LifeProTips,not_removed,how does one imagine sisyphus happy thank you for the video
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait wouldnt the gym be the habit and fitness be the goal
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly you dont need someone to come over and get me motivated to go to the gym today for the same reason you dont need someone to come motivate you to shower and brush your teeth in the morning its just what you do
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the goddamned definition im neither being pedantic or a smartass what op meant is clearly confusing given that half the damn comments at the time were i cant tell what op is even trying to say
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i think this is one of the better lpts yes its more abstract than specific instructions on getting all of the toothpaste out of the tube but its still valuable
LifeProTips,not_removed,the gym is where this phrase gets promoted most lately and theyre correct making real progress in fitness isnt about your ability to have a good work out when can hype yourself up and feel like its about your ability on all those days you dont feel like it to go clock in at the gym and put your hours in anyways
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats habit though isnt it habit and discipline dont seem to me to be necessarily the same thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,ill start doing my inspired homework after one more reddit post well okay maybe just one more i joke but here i am at finding myself checking reddit every min to see if theres anything new with no other reason keeping me from going to bed even though im tired and have to be up soon
LifeProTips,not_removed,reddit is his homework
LifeProTips,not_removed,no fucko its the principle of it the idea of im not disciplined enough to go thru with certain things therefore i need to learn to discipline myself if i want greater results
LifeProTips,not_removed,now that aint a bad idea
LifeProTips,not_removed,just remember that it is absolutely normal for humans to not have a concept of future benefit planning ahead is hard and relatively recent youre literally fighting against your primal instincts be kind to yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree
LifeProTips,not_removed,you do have motivation youre just misusing the word
LifeProTips,not_removed,youve got the motivation to not fail
LifeProTips,not_removed,i really enjoyed this particular response of yours
LifeProTips,not_removed,take motivation as being excited to accomplish a task discipline as knowing a task needs to be done and completing it regardless of attitude but if youre not motivated you still wont do it bad days are a thing discipline be damned
LifeProTips,not_removed,yea i read something similar on reddit actually that willpower having limits is just a myth
LifeProTips,not_removed,just do things for some reason is the basic version of this lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,no not at all through discipline you become more motivated its small steps at a time mate if youve disciplined yourself to accomplish the smallest tasks then the slightly larger ones wont seem nearly as insurmountable
LifeProTips,not_removed,heres my tip set a deadline if you want something done that you lack motivation for if that deadline is not already present another tip maybe unrelated but set mini deadlines or divide bigger tasks into smaller sections for example i need to study this book that will now become i need to study this book before friday i will study chapter on monday on tuesday etc final tip just start something you lack motivation for and only focus on a little start the rest will come much easier just focus on what would be a start in the book example ill just read page one i can always put it down after that edit oh right another one i like if it only takes minutes to do do it right away reply to an email etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,the first thing you need to define is what you want do you want to be better in your profession set some clear goals and work towards them if you sit down and make a list you can probably pinpoint what you need in that regard is it a personal matter set clear goals on your grooming dressing and get a routine going instead of browsing reddit start some youtube tutorials up and begin experimenting is it about your house your bills deal with each bill as it comes in and set a standard for what level of cleanliness and tidiness you want in your house cleaning and tidying up has some logic and skill involved dont be afraid to learn how to do things more optimally the internet has resources learn about what products to use and how in what order to do things look up how often you should clean windows the oven the fridge my advice would be to think about it often and to reason with yourself dont accept flaws you can work with if youre lazy or postpone then give yourself a mental slap and change think ahead try to only take breaks when youre done
LifeProTips,not_removed,break down the task into steps segments or categories figure out what it is exactly that you dont feel like doing why isolate that and smother it with a pillow because youre an adult with responsibilities and some shit just needs to get done separate how you feel about something with the mechanical actions or thoughts that you need to get though and focus on starting and progressing a task instead of how it makes you feel adulting
LifeProTips,not_removed,im sorry was that not
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you want to really learn discipline start learning mindful meditation start meditation practices or even just breathing exercises no stray thoughts just breathing and putting focus on nothing but breathing and your surroundings
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomelirazejpg
LifeProTips,not_removed,do what is uncomfortable often eat food you really dont like take cold showers its healthier anyway do planks every day do the dishes at your next family gathering basically start kicking your egos bitchy little ass around and it will shrink in power and veracity the movie revolver goes into this stuff too
LifeProTips,not_removed,deadline while i was expecting this
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpsyoutubekxgrhdiwue all youll ever need
LifeProTips,not_removed,or a combination of both plus variations of a shittonne of other stuff that you cant even begin to adequately explain in a single sentence
LifeProTips,not_removed,we are what we repeatedly do aristotle
LifeProTips,not_removed,the best practical distinction between the two ive seen came from jim wendler motivation ebbs and flows its fleeting at times discipline by nature does not it stays with you and facilitates getting shit done even when your motivation level has dropped you may not be motivated to get shit done at that moment but because you are disciplined youre going to do it anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,what you described as disciplined is also driven by something its just further away or more general being a better person would also count as motivation wouldnt it
LifeProTips,not_removed,one is mental the other is emotional totally not just playing with words
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok then the problem with that advice is you have to have discipline in order to get discipline its literally telling someone to pull themselves up by their bootstraps it doesnt make any sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,motivation the reason or reasons one has for acting or behaving in a particular way discipline the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behavior using punishment to correct disobedience punishment is a form of motivation
LifeProTips,not_removed,sooo how do i acquire the capacitycapability offor following through with a requirement i placed on myself like im genuinely curious
LifeProTips,not_removed,is your comment implying that emotions arent mental
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i dont have the urge that drives you to do something that you follow i wont be motivated to have the requirement that you place on yourself to do something
LifeProTips,not_removed,motivated by money
LifeProTips,not_removed,in this situation you are motivated by the fear of negative consequences of losing your job if you won the lottery tomorrow you wouldnt go and do that job you hate every single day because you would lose the motivation to do so and no amount of discipline would change your mind if you did go do a job you hate even though you had enough money i would guess your motivation would be a selfidentity belief such as moral people work hard in which case your motivation is upholding your own self concept there is always motivation it just isnt always positive
LifeProTips,not_removed,not really its not like you have a choice in most cases
LifeProTips,not_removed,that sounds more depressing than disciplined
LifeProTips,not_removed,try taking to cover plate off some manufacturers hide the switch to prevent us from doing anything check your fluoride levels as well if they are too high then you may have to look into a replacement body hopefully youre still under warranty

LifeProTips,not_removed,wow now ill learn to make a bot and annoy you everytime you ripped son thanks for ruining it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i often motivate myself to do shit i dont want to do its going to be suck but it has to be done start doing it you troll bitch motivation and discipline arent mutually exclusive ¯ツ¯
LifeProTips,not_removed,i actually disagree a little its not about the content that youre doing it but the context i dont want to read these last ten pages because im tired and had a long day at work vs if i read these ten pages ill be better equipped to help someone in the future and my work will get easier with a larger knowledge base d
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wasnt using them interchangeably they are two separate things i was just shortening my sentence
LifeProTips,not_removed,well i was just talking about reluctance and laziness but okay
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes thats why i called it advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,here is the full text less than a read from camus httpdbanachcomsisyphushtm but basically camus says that pushing the boulder life is a task that is meaningless in itself sisyphus does not look for some absurd meaning in it to make himself happy he embraces the meaningless he is able to find joy in his meaningless task he chooses to be happy in pushing the boulder for the sake of pushing the boulder our time on this earth is short and might be ultimately meaningless do not let that deter you from doing things that make you better and make you happy i use this line of thinking whenever im on the verge of an existential crisis lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,good habits are built with discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not habit its absolutely willpower
LifeProTips,not_removed,true but motivation is very fleeting sure you can be motivated to go a week for a month that motivation will disappear if you dont become disciplined youll just stop going you can wait till youre pumped up to go the the gym or it just not be a big part of your life
LifeProTips,not_removed,this hits to close to home
LifeProTips,not_removed,this hits to close to home
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am supposed to write a report
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are literally just telling yourself you have to do something you dont want to do dont think too hard you might hurt yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you have to do laundry you might be missing the motivation so instead of sitting there and thinking for minutes on how to get motivated to go do laundry just use discipline and get up and do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think op was using motivation as in enjoying something of course theres some kind of motivation behind everything but often people dont do things even if they have long term motivation because it sucks to do
LifeProTips,not_removed,is this a race to bottom to see who is the most worse off my point still stands if you have a serious mental issue you arent going to find the solution on a lpt post
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a tedious tidbit in my job that i tend to postpone when i postpone it and theres two it becomes a burden i only have to remind myself about the consequence and im happily doing it asap
LifeProTips,not_removed,but if the disciplin is your problem what if you miss the disciplin to follow these deadlines
LifeProTips,not_removed,i will study chapter on monday on tuesday etc thats the problem ill just study chapter and on friday instead
LifeProTips,not_removed,for me its i just read this page but if i quit now i might not remember where i was so ill read another and remember the page number hmm but its not a good page and the sentence finishes on the next one before i know it i have read a chapter and hated most of it but i did it at least another thing is to go on memorise and learn a language doesnt even have to be something you dont know set a goal and do it every day and it will suck when you forget one day and have to start over on the accomplishment meter but you can learn basic discipline that way by doing little by little and slowly building up
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hadnt yet received my discount card for my job and all i had to do was make a two minute call to order a new one ive been here almost six months and i finally called a few days ago
LifeProTips,not_removed,love these tips
LifeProTips,not_removed,dang it got me
LifeProTips,not_removed,we is entirely subjective the thought that we exist as something more special than a rock and arent inherently the rock itself is our major flaw you are the universe and the universe is you the distinction only exists because we humans like to classify label and separate things in order to make sense of our lives
LifeProTips,not_removed,for the argument of how you impact others your actions including speaking your personal beliefs are what matter if you are able to truly bring a private thought to the grave having told no one and left no trace of it the thought impacts no one
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes but there is a core of motivation sitting inside discipline a voice saying i need to do this because it matters youre not feeling like doing it now but you do it because there are results you would like to see or consequences you want to avoid as someone who used to have a lot of discipline that was wasted on tasks that i didnt think mattered because external consequences were placed on them let me just say that it is entirely soul crushing it left me nihilistic depressed and with a dreadful sense of existential angst discipline can bridge the gap between when you are highly motivated to do something but if those gaps are too large you will fall right in
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre going to do it anyway thats the part that gets me though how is this different from motivation if im not motivated to do the thing i wont if im doing the thing then i was motivated enough to do it just my cents
LifeProTips,not_removed,good distinction its the discipline i struggle with the most then
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe mental isnt the best word perhaps rational is better its the difference between doing something because you enjoy the task and doing something because you like the not necessarily short term consequences one you will just do the other you need to think about talk yourself into
LifeProTips,not_removed,well its not but a better way to phrase it may be that discipline is rational motivation is emotional
LifeProTips,not_removed,discipline is built and it really is good advice you just do it quit thinking and do the task its going to be really tough at first but youll notice how much easier it gets if you keep repeating the process
LifeProTips,not_removed,so every time you study it is because you are motivated to achieve an aim if you had no goal at the end of that degree and found study laborious it would be discipline that kept you studying rather than procrastinating think of it this way when the voice in your head says im bored and want to watch tv now it is discipline to ignore it and continue when the voice says it wants to do something like study and you go do that it is motivation that let you do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,no when youre sick of studying after a few years when youre broke and barely making ends meet when it would just be easier to give it up and stop your motivation is gone if you keep going because you made a commitment to do it even though you dont want to that takes dedication
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you do something because you feel like it thats motivation when you do something even though you feel like stopping and not doing it thats discipline one is easy and comes naturally the other is difficult and requires lots of hard work
LifeProTips,not_removed,no i wouldnt you would only be motivated by you using those words im doubting you understand what discipline is
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe the question should be can you create motivation when it doesnt come to youarise out of no foreseeable will of your own
LifeProTips,not_removed,no you seem to be playing with words in a way that doesnt demonstrate your point
LifeProTips,not_removed,you have a point but if you go with that path you are always motivated for obtaining something the point here is the enjoyment you wash dishes clean your clothes or broom the floor not because you are motivated to have a clean house but because you know its what you have to do discipline is knowing you have to do something and doing it even if you dont like it
LifeProTips,not_removed,you always have a choice you are a free man i hope
LifeProTips,not_removed,not bot but ill be looking forward to it
LifeProTips,not_removed,¯ツ¯
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess the issue is really believing something has to be done
LifeProTips,not_removed,good for you buddy glad your life is perfect
LifeProTips,not_removed,they can be but much of the research ive seen about habits are about how they can be built despite the lack of discipline and even in part as an alternative to having discipline hence my earlier comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,have you got some evidence you can point me at ive seen various scientific papers etc about the power of habit so interested what the evidence is that says its about willpower not habit
LifeProTips,not_removed,wuuuuuuuut no shit you dont think i realize that you damn walnut if i dont want to do it i end up not doing it and putting it off you really came on my comment to try and lecture me like youre some eintein why lmao instead of being a dick just be happy for someone else that theyre trying to do better in their life you pompous fool
LifeProTips,not_removed,just use discipline and get up and do it right click use discipline its that simple guys why dont you get it
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you have to do laundry you might be missing the motivation so instead of sitting there and thinking for minutes on how to get motivated to go do laundry you have two options wash your clothes or wear dirty clothes it really shouldnt take minutes to think it through and make a choice an example that keeps popping up im not motivated to go to work fine you dont have to you can quit a any time you want seriously but then ah the alternative is worse then go to work since apparently that is actually what you want
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i do laundry and am not motivated i listen to podcasts while doing laundry which makes me highly motivated and productive no discipline needed
LifeProTips,not_removed,and heres me wondering what the tedious tidbit consists of
LifeProTips,not_removed,you gotta slowly like train yourself to get more discipline over time its a slow painful conscious effort just dont give up though eventually it gets easier
LifeProTips,not_removed,not everyone is able to self discipline or self motivate you can always ask others to help you make agreements with others for example i motivated my girlfriend that she could pick out a brand new phone if she quit smoking but used discipline by agreeing with her she had to give it back if she started again she quit for over two years now so since she lacked self discipline and motivation to do it i was able to help her not saying you should ask others to buy you phones if you do a task right lol but even asking someone that wants to help you stay motivated or disciplined simply by having them support you or check in on you to see if youre doing the things you need motivationdiscipline for i have this thing with my cooworker that if we see the other slacking off ie reddit they will try and motivate you to get back to work or at least check if the other is stuck on something etc so try that if you lack both
LifeProTips,not_removed,start small come up with something simple that should be relatively easy for you to follow through cut something harmful out of your life or set a time to be in bed with all your electronic devices off once you realize that you can create positive change in your life it will be easier to set and achieve bigger goals for yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the problem lll tell myself to do that but only end up skimming through the chapters on saturday morning
LifeProTips,not_removed,part of it is to build a habit of the act but that in itself is not applicable to all things as is for all advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats reasonable i like to keep the distinction between the two but i certainly think theres merit to your stance as well really just semantics
LifeProTips,not_removed,i too struggle with instilling discipline as far as the difference between the two i think the difference is doing something even if you dont feel like doing it i think discipline is just another word for habit you create a habit by just forcing yourself to do something and then giving yourself a reward at the end of it do this everyday for days or so and you have a habit you can take away the reward and you will still keep doing the task
LifeProTips,not_removed,do you consider yourself to be motivated to brush your teeth do you have a youtube list of inspirational music to get you pumped up to go into the bathroom and brush the fuck out of your teeth or do you just do it because its a habit and a chore and you understand the outcome having healthy teeth in your old age is a worthwhile one thats the difference between motivation and discipline with discipline you dont need to be in the perfect mindset or even excited about he task you are doing you just do it because its what you do
LifeProTips,not_removed,the way i do it is when i feel my motovation waning i try creative ways to get myself motivated it could be as simple as promising myslef a reward if i stick with my given task for x more minutes or trying to get myself interested in another aspect of the task that is tangentially related to my initial motivation or making a game of a particular aspect of the task it kind of came as a coping mechanism for my adhd and i still have a tendency to become overwhelmed with frustration and anxious energy once whatever it is im working on ceases to be interesting but i have never been able to have any sort of discipline as people normally describe it my ability to stick with something until it is done has always been either a superhuman ability to forget to eat piss or shit for or wanting to punch holes in the wall and flay the skin off the nearest persons face with my teeth until i can afford to do drop my current task for whatever interest it is im currently compelled to pursue the ability to be anywhere in between those two extremes is an effort that i have been able to maintain for about at most the only reason ive gotten this far is that i can rein in that frustration and manage it to an extent by trying to get myself interested in another part of the task and can get away with blasting through shit in fervent bursts of energy throughout the week or in a desparate blitz the day before it needs to be done
LifeProTips,not_removed,i understand what you are getting at but at the end of the day it doesnt matter motivation through discipline is still motivation and if one cannot muster it then nothing happens
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree with you i find discipline comes from habits and unfortunately sometimes we need to motivate ourselves to actually create habits so by rewarding ourselves to have discipline we create motivation and develop habits habits look like discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can be motivated to do a task you dont enjoy though
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive never wanted to study i rarely enjoy it the only reason i do it is because im motivated by the end result graduating and work so i consider motivation a prerequisite for discipline i cant understand why one would study if they dont enjoy it or have an end game motivator seems like a waste of time to generalize this could you for example carry ten rocks daily from point a to point b for no reason at all thats pure discipline with no motivation behind it just a meaningless task that you do for the sake of doing it motivation without discipline is fairly useless as well theyre both required to achieve long term goals
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey now were struggling to understand motivation and discipline and now you want to throw in dedication as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think no would power through anything if they did not have motivation i wouldnt go to university if there wasnt a degree or promise of a good future in it for me its just varying levels of motivation and you need both in tandem to persist when things go south i dont think anyone could do anything without some kind of reward or punishment thats just how we work but its what lets us get things done
LifeProTips,not_removed,i get your point but let me give you my anecdotal example i clean my house because im motivated to not live in filth and i do a damn good job making sure everything shines my roommate on the other hand do it for discipline and he cant be bother to move a chair to clean underneath he is terrible at cleaning and doesnt give a crap about how clean our house is but disciplined enough to do it once a week i guess you can have discipline to do stuff but if you arent motivated maybe things arent going to get well done
LifeProTips,not_removed,but anything that you do you are motivated by something washing and cleaning because you dont wanna live in a pig sty and be ashamed when people visit work because i need money duh eating healthy and exercising cause id like to not die at age everything you do involves some motivation no one just does something for literally no fucking reason at all so this is nonsense advice that plays with words just do things for some reason even if you dont want to ok well why am i doing it oh so i have a reason to do it then i have motivation to do it idiot
LifeProTips,not_removed,which leads to the second freedom the freedom to starve
LifeProTips,not_removed,not bot dont lie to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,i didnt have the discipline to type three backslashes ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° edit i just noticed your username youd have a field day following me
LifeProTips,not_removed,care to link some because in my mind to build a habit you have to do things constantly and even you do things constantly that literally means you have been disciplined
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh are you angry the opposite of einstein really just simplified it and said dont overthink it there aristotle
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think this now has turned into hurt feelings the word discipline is a trigger word for a lot of people here it seems its almost like you guys think im on the mental illness subreddit telling people to just stop being depressed i think it is due to people that know they dont have discipline lashing out at people that utilize it trying to make them feel like they are the ones with a lack of knowledge telling them that discipline sounds awfully like brainwash only a fool would challenge his bodys instincts to rest longer than needed or eat more than your body needs it is like discipline is taught over motivation in the lower working class they dont want to do what society has left open for them to do but they must motivation is taught over discipline in familys of privilege telling them they can be anything and to pursue goals to better them selves neither is wrong and neither is a lesser both need to be instilled equally both take inner strength but i think i am seeing the division of personalities that are claiming each side now
LifeProTips,not_removed,discipline is where you dont have those conversations with yourself so theres no room for rationalizing not doing the thing you just shut the line of thought down and do the thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok think of this fat people dont have motivation to eat properly because they dont care about their self image but if you had discipline you would know that you cant keep doing that to your body because if you do then people have to come and help you when you reach so discipline is when you dont want to do something but have to motivation is when you do something because you want to because there are motives behind it discipline you do because you know it is what is the right choice even though you are un motivated
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude are you trolling or do you want to elaborate on the part you dont believe makes no sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed that it is better for your self to come to terms and find the motivation that is great solution to a lot of mundane things i need to do as well but at some point you dont have and scapegoats and just have to do things time and again
LifeProTips,not_removed,they have to push a button every minutes to prevent catastrophe
LifeProTips,not_removed,probably some random job op has to do that heshe doesnt wanna share with reddit hence the tidbit ay
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,even still motivation is required to build the habit and motivation is required every day to maintain it at least from my perspective i think people tend to ascribe the more solid foundational attributes of habits and choices to discipline while reserving the flimsy and cyclical attributes for motivation for me though they are one of the same and just depends on who you are and how you behave whether or not your choices fade away with motivation or stick around as discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,the way i see it i am motivated to brush my teeth cause i dont want to get cavities or yellow stained teeth if there is a benefit to completing a task then the benefit is the motivation to do the thing if i could instead just not brush and still have perfect teeth breathhygieneetc then i wouldnt brush it seems like the distinction you and others are making is in enjoyment of the task but to me personally thats an entirely different beast altogether for example i love basketball but sometimes despite loving the sport i dont have the motivation to get up and play i also despise doing dishes yet im still motivated to do them because its my responsibility for my own sake as well my roommates another distinction people tend to make is that discipline doesnt fade away like motivation does i also disagree with this there are days when i go about my daily routine no problem but there are also days when i dont even have the willpower to change out of my pjs usually cause ill have woken up in the afternoon on a saturday does that mean i havent built the discipline of changing clothes i dont think so it just means i wasnt feeling it that day tldr yes i am motivated to brush no i dont think habit discipline and im still not sure there is any real difference between motivation and discipline other than the vocabulary used to describe them sorry if i sound rude i dont mean to
LifeProTips,not_removed,clean to toilet or you dont get to eat dinner if i dont run i will be fat and nobody will love me fear and pain can be motivators too they arent great long term but they can certainly get you to do things
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly i mean everything you do youre motivated to do discipline is just the act of actually doing it consistently for example i lift weights because i want to look good and be generally healthy sometimes i cant be fucked i remind myself why i do it i sigh and go out and do it the motivation is my entire reason for doing it and the discipline is simply the habit i have formed where i do it everyday even when id rather drink beers and eat junk food instead this lpt is literal nonsense it does imply any actual information about how one forces themselves to do activities that do not offer immediately gratification besides just do things only a year old stoner would think this is deep
LifeProTips,not_removed,we need a venn diagram for this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i loled
LifeProTips,not_removed,you got me and i probably should have said defecation because i just muddied the water
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes you just lose motivation though if you encounter some really tough obstacles or your life turns to shit you just lose willingness to do anything and think that every bit of effort will be futile at this point only discipline can save you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think you guys are confusing different concepts the incentive you have to do something hard and that rare feeling of industriousness we get once in a blue moon we call both motivation but theyre pretty separate
LifeProTips,not_removed,of course you can be disciplined and still do the things wrong but you do it and thats a lot specially on things like work out cleaning or similar routinary tasks just doing it is the hardest part from time to time just doing it ends in improving the tasks and even enjoying it in some way
LifeProTips,not_removed,hahaha like i said you are not wrong but you have to put motivation and enjoyment in a balance to know if you are using discipline or not imagine you are a soldier you do your bed everyday not to make the room more beautiful but because if you dont do it they gonna arrest you you can argue this is motivation created by fear but in fact you end doing it just because you do it everyday and probably when you go home you do it anyway because you are used to it this is discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,but
LifeProTips,not_removed,i found a lot via this book which is also quite an enjoyable read too httpcharlesduhiggcomthepowerofhabit
LifeProTips,not_removed,angry over reddit yea noi do hate pretentious pricks like you tho nobodys overthinking anything its just a realization that i need more discipline in life and for some reason you must correct me in my realization like i actually give a fuck about your advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,discipline is where you dont have those conversations with yourself so theres no room for rationalizing not doing the thing you just shut the line of thought down and do the thing that sounds more like lack of thought or even some kind of brainwashing if you actually have to think about have that conversation to figure out why you should do that thing its probably a good idea to start thinking so many people quit their jobs and got happier by doing this wait why am i going to work again this is not the career i want this is what other people expect wait why do i drive a longer route to get to that cheap gas station the difference is to small to matter and i hate their pumps why am i cleaning these dishes so thoroughly before i put them in the washing machine just to feel like a better and more disciplined person lets check the manual to see the recommendation oh it says not to clean too thoroughly because it uses the fat to grease the bearings why am i dusting the topside of my closet weekly when nobody ever sees it just to feel better maybe monthly is enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok think of this fat people dont have motivation to eat properly because they dont care about their self image wow seriously
LifeProTips,not_removed,no for i lack the motivation to do so
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,i miss lost
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a fair and interesting take on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,well of course there is some form of benefit for doing the task why else would it even be in consideration at all i dont think anyone goes around doing things just cause there is always some form of repayment in a sense what i dont understand is the actually distinction people are making behind the reasoning for doing the task for me either way you look at it completing the task has benefits so you complete it did you complete it cause its inherently enjoyable or for the benefits either way you know you are getting something out of it enjoyment or some other sort of gain so you do the thing to get the goods
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the thing i dont believe people who hit rock bottom just continue on with their routines as if nothing happened i thought i hit rock bottom sometimes but i kept pushing through things i didnt like doing not just because of discipline but because i knew i wanted to get it done and it would benefit me in the long run and there are some parts that i actually liked doing if i didnt have that i wouldnt have stuck with it i just think discipline and motivation go hand in hand and if you completely lose motivation discipline cant be the only thing that keeps you going
LifeProTips,not_removed,yea but my point is theyre not that separate i have a general feeling of industriousness which enables me to learn and work towards a future that im excited about sure there are sudden surges of it that allows me to do more but i need a base constant source of motivation in order to set routines and practice discipline towards
LifeProTips,not_removed,its still just playing with words motivation essentially means a reason any reason literally anything you decide to do has a reason behind it discipline is a vague word with no real meaning that essentially just describes doing something for long term benefit discipline doesnt imply you hate the task or that you enjoy it the word does not include any definition of how much fun you have doing the task so saying dont worry about motivation just use discipline literally makes no fucking sense basically its saying do things you have no reason to be doing for no reason at all because discipline i mean perhaps he did have some actual point but the way its worded makes no sense whatsoever whatever things we have to be doing we have motivation to do it doing something frequently for no reason is just called a habit and it really doesnt even apply to this scenario since this post is about doing things you have to do not just making the bed because you did it so much that you now do it for no reason the idea of the post is to help people do things they know they need to do therefore already have motivation to do but are too lazy to do and this post offers no explanation whatsoever as to how to make that easier besides just do it which is essentially saying nothing at all its nonsense its a cringey kind of stoner level shower thought that boils down to nothing useful whatsoever the kind of thing i would realise made no sense after i sobered up but when i was stoned as fuck seemed clever
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of the points about habitbuilding is that you can do something such as not having any biscuits in the home which builds the habit of not eating them even though youre still hopeless undisciplined when a plate of biscuits is in front of you its changing the environment around you to remove choices which require discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,those are great examples of things not to bother applying discipline to exercise using your seatbelt and indicators eating healthy getting up at consistent times these are examples of things that are worth applying discipline to of course examine and determine where discipline is appropriate discipline is the tool you use to not repeat that same examination each time the thing comes up
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol its not brainwashing its just a recognition that sometimes your thoughts can work against you yeah overall thinking about things is good but for a lot of people the constant internal debate and chatter can become harmful and keep you from doing things constant hand wringing over when youre going to do the laundry is just exhausting letting your mind run wild with all the reasons you dont want to wake up for work in the morning is pointless if youre going to get up and do it every day shit or get off the pot as randall said in clerks there is such a thing as overthinking and theres certainly such a thing as not thinking enough some good discipline can help you prevent the overthinking that just gets in your way
LifeProTips,not_removed,a lot of horrible trigger points but i mean it does kinda hit the mark from your exchange with foohentai i can see you are not really understanding or trying to rather your on the defensive for what you believe your interpretation of those two words mean you seem to feel like discipline is for the week or degenerate that it is unnecessary you are assuming that people are always motivated and never falter their path i would almost say that you dont understand discipline because you dont have any discipline is instilled with practice and respect maybe life has been really well laid for you and youve avoided leaning discipline if you always get your way have things arranged by other people have no responsibilities that affect others or use limitless money as a crutch have horrible morals and are a apathetic person these would all be traits that lead to a avoidance of the need to learn discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,well i hope you loose the motivation to breathe as well i was being kind and had typed up a simplified version of how to understand discipline vs motivation but you deleted your comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah you guys stole this from my brain
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont no offense
LifeProTips,not_removed,some people are very in the moment and dont do things now unless they want to do the thing now its all about prioritization there are many things you could be doing at any moment from relaxing to running to doing your taxes you are using discipline if you are not pursuing what you want to do most in that moment nobody does things with absolutely no reason but our motivations can be disconnected from our present happiness and it can take a great exercise of willpower to deprioritize our current feelings in exchange for future ones
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont know about you but i do not have a general feeling of industriousness i have a general feeling of lethargy and wanting to take it easy and must push myself using discipline to get anything done it is very very very rare for me to actually want to do anything useful and that very rare want is what id call the kind of motivation that most people wait for dont do your homework now because you dont feel like you lack motivation dont want to do your homework but you push through anyway discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,you cant be motivated everyday discipline is the capacity to work out even if that day you are not motivated at all you know you want to have those awesome muscles but you didnt feel like it deserves the effort today with discipline you do it anyway thats the point discipline is having the capacity to do something even if you dont want to because you know its what you have to do you wake up early every day because you are disciplined not because you are motivated its impossible to be motivated everyday op only stated that for motivation you need enjoyment but for discipline you not
LifeProTips,not_removed,every thought is just playing with words if you think of it that way doesnt mean its not right the difference between the two comes down to immediate satisfaction discipline is the will power you build up to do a task that isnt immediately satisfying motivation is a natural drive to do something that comes from within with motivation you ride a wave its easy with discipline you push yourself so its harder but discipline can be built up over time heres how they work together a guy is motivated to join the military and serve the country he has an internal drive to do this however all the tasks along the way there arent going to be enjoyable discipline gets him up early to go on a run discipline gets him through the shoe shining hes ordered to do even though he doesnt think its that important maybe motivation comes into play for small tasks along the way like he finds that hes motivated to get the best time on an obstacle course so he does his best and beats everyone else in a big competition motivation won the race discipline got him in shape beforehand you can call this all playing with words but theres a reason the two words exist and they each have different meanings you just sound like you need some discipline
LifeProTips,not_removed,those are great examples of things not to bother applying discipline to exercise using your seatbelt and indicators eating healthy getting up at consistent times these are examples of things that are worth applying discipline to nah it works for those as well seatbelt i use it for safety indicators safety and to not feel like an asshole getting up at consistent times its easier maybe not today but theres also a tomorrow discipline is the tool you use to not repeat that same examination each time the thing comes up memory work well for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,again wow i dont know if you are trolling or the two of us just cant talk but thats barely related to what i said
LifeProTips,not_removed,well i hope you loose the motivation to breathe as well lol gee whiz guy you wish death on people over lame internet conversations so youre not really someone anybody wants advice from anyway good luck with being a psychopath
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow calm down there
LifeProTips,not_removed,did we or are we merely projections of your subconscious to keep you company in purgatory
LifeProTips,not_removed,the first season looked hopeful
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah okay i see your point basically a long term vs short term mentality
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the thing though why do we push through why do homework at all either the expectation of reward or fear of failure we need some underlying motivation to keep us moving forward not saying you dont need some discipline but just that theyre more closely related than you might think
LifeProTips,not_removed,sigh the word motivation is vague it just means that you have a reason to complete a task it does not imply that youre having the time of your life doing a task discipline is also a vague term that only means you are doing an activity for long term reward you didnt even read my reply at all or respond to any point i made this post does not give any actual technique that makes it easier to do things you dont feel like doing it essentially just says force yourself to do things but plays with the meaning of the words motivation and discipline there is nothing to extract from this post to actually put into action i mean people can already comprehend the idea of forcing themselves to do something and they usually just fucking dont because they cant be bothered this post may as well be just do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,lets go with the latter im now realizing its all individual interpretationits like what i believe to be fast inst fast for you because you fly jets and im in a wheelchair what comes first the chicken or the egg it is weird how big of a divide this has created i never knew i had so much built up informationtension on how i feel about what i do in my life because im motivated and what i do under the contextbelief that i refer to as discipline i think maybe people with high discipline might have weird complexes that hold them self to a standard that may not be realistic they say fuck you im better than a person that leaves dirty dishes for more than a afternoon so ive got to push through and do it then ill go for a run because with out making my self do these things im not good enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,it did then it became a room full of chimps on type writers
LifeProTips,not_removed,button up your collar if you are wearing a tie please wear a belt i dont know your skin color but a classic black and white tie and suit goes with everything dont roll your sleeves up if youre wearing a coat try to wear soemthing that fits you really well i always wear slim fit dont get skinny get slim and have fun
LifeProTips,not_removed,its probably a little last minute to be too picky about what youre going to wear since im guessing you dont own a suit but if youre planning on going out to buy one tomorrow the biggest mistake guys make in wearing a suit is getting stuff that doesnt fit right a lot of guys wear suits that are too big and or baggy this looks especially tacky with the shirt i see a lot of guys especially guys that are a little heavy wearing shirts that get all bunched up at the bottom because theyre too big get a fitted shirt if youre able too
LifeProTips,not_removed,have a read
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is puzzling to me there are a bunch of shopsstores where they offer professional help free of charge i like breitling not sure if you find it everywhere though i can just walk in there and i am instantly met by people in suits to which i calmly explain exactly what i need this can be done in any way imaginable i need a suit insert properties for insert occasion or just i need a nice suit they will then find something that suits you and sell it to you beware the prices my upper limit is eur usd they will also dress you up and give you all the tips you need
LifeProTips,not_removed,shoes and belt should match
LifeProTips,not_removed,hitting up rmensfashion otherwise just ask someone at your school like a dean or a parent
LifeProTips,not_removed,a two button suit is preferable over a button suit if going button middle button and possibly the first button as well but never bottom what makes a suit shine is fit which probably you wont get the ideal in such short time try not going too bulky too large try as tight as you can get without making you uncomfortable both jacket and pants extend your arms wearing the suit ask for opinions have fun
LifeProTips,not_removed,rent a suit ask the people at the menswear store what is appropriate for you follow their instructions theres very little need to buy a suit and all the trappings if youre only going to wear one every years by the time you need to wear it again itll be out of fashion and probably wont fit right
LifeProTips,not_removed,never button the top on a threebuttoned suit
LifeProTips,not_removed,wouldnt having the same color pocket square and tie match nicer also for the button suit why only the top button
LifeProTips,not_removed,also personally i wouldnt cut the stitching on any outer jacket pockets shit isnt supposed to go in them so leave the tack stitching to remind you not to use them
LifeProTips,not_removed,pocket square matching with shirt is better
LifeProTips,not_removed,people around here dont want actual tips that come from the real world theyre here for google based tips only
LifeProTips,not_removed,for two buttons top button only for three buttons middle button only unbutton for sitting i dont know why just is
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree it looks better when the pocket square and the shirt are complimentary colours but not exactly matching when you have a pocket square that matches the tieshirt it just looks like you bought a kit
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,no man should ever own a black suit unless its for a funeral black suits are far too severe and dont look great in daylight navy or charcoal is always the way to go
LifeProTips,not_removed,here is what i do i pull the back of my tongue up to the roof of my mouth making sure that no liquid can go down my throat then i take a sip of liquid while still not letting it go down my throat after i move the cupbottle away from my mouth closing my mouth in the process then i swallow the liquid tldr i use my mouth like an airlock for the liquid
LifeProTips,not_removed,life pro tip this doesnt work when youre turning source basic knowledge of physics
LifeProTips,not_removed,just run a tube down you can get gasline at any hardware store for like cents a foot
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just use two hands to stabilize it nicely
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt wrap your mouth around the nozzle of the water bottle like it was intended why would you expose your upper lip to the liquid youre drinking
LifeProTips,not_removed,im curious as to how many times this life pro tip is actually useful because i dont know of very many people who feel they need to drink from their waterbottle on a bus while its lurching about lpt wait for a traffic light or a stop
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought everyone did this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel the need to drink from my water bottle on a bus while its lurching around the thing about waiting for a traffic light or a stop is that the bus can move again at any time and that defeats the purpose of trying to avoid lurching in the first place the ideal time to drink water is when the bus is going in a nice straight line without any stopping but if the bus is going through a city or stuck in stopandgo traffic i may be inclined to just go for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,after encountering a public restroom with a push down tap and fire hose pressure be good person and give the shut off valve a few cranks to lower the water pressure to something reasonable
LifeProTips,not_removed,bit difficult when most public bathroom taps are push down taps
LifeProTips,not_removed,spray pam in before the noodles come to a boil maybe a light oil aerosol spray and a stove burner going full blast just beneath it well those two have a chance of not combining very well
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can just put a wooden ladle over the pot
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always just drizzled a little olive oil into the pot it breaks up the surface tension and prevents large bubbles from forming
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont know how you cook noodles but i stir mine occasionally put them in a big pot halffull of water and maybe not turn up the pot full blast minutes isnt a very long time anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,possibly the worst lpt ive ever seen
LifeProTips,not_removed,or spoon it bursts any bubbles that contact it and this prevents overboiling but that being said walking away from the area where something is boiling full tilt is a bad idea spoon or not turning the burner down when it starts to boil is the best answer
LifeProTips,not_removed,reyebrowremovingtips
LifeProTips,not_removed,op is assuming you arent there when its boiling
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe read the title again
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,into the boiling pot of noodles if its already boiling turning it down is the best option if you do have to leave the room

LifeProTips,not_removed,so what is happening when gmail asks you if you want to mark as spam and unsubscribe i never actually go to a website or enter anything just click yes and move along never see an email from them again
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep this is my experience also
LifeProTips,not_removed,just throw the computer away and buy a new one
LifeProTips,not_removed,upvote thanks for the laugh usquirtingperiodfart one time i was having car troubles and my boy told me to throw it in the gutter go buy another btw as an amateur student of meditation your user name squirtingperiodfart reminds me of an exercise i sometimes do where all thoughts are welcome for thoughts are things and all things are transitory furthermore their only power is given to them by us be the watcher of the thought while not invested in it
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,whats the big deal they get cleaned either way as soapy water goes through fabric and anyway sockballing is just extra time wasted you have to roll them up then unroll them the next day just grab two damn socks and put them on your feet
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude get a grip you dont need to be controlling over how someone else takes off their damn socks
LifeProTips,not_removed,actually them being inside out is better the dead skin cells cant easily leave the sock if it is not inside out but when washed inside out they get cleaner unless shes walking around the yard or a dirty house and getting shit stuck on the bottom of the sock iso is better also get the fuck over it if you cant stand a stupid sock issue there is no way in hell you will last together
LifeProTips,not_removed,i turn my socks inside in when i put them on
LifeProTips,not_removed,find someone else life is too short
LifeProTips,not_removed,am i the only one who is too lazy to give a shit and just wears socks inside out no one is going to see them and theres not a huge difference in functionality
LifeProTips,not_removed,you do your mistresses laundry i feel like youre doing this the wrong way
LifeProTips,not_removed,wrong i go to the gym so people can stare at how fit i am i never disapoint
LifeProTips,not_removed,cam confirm source am guy pictured here
LifeProTips,not_removed,and yet youtube has thousands of videos that mock people at the gym
LifeProTips,not_removed,who taught you to type like that
LifeProTips,not_removed,second this the vast majority of people dont care and dont pay attention to what youre doing in the gym
LifeProTips,not_removed,anywhere as long as you get started i like to make lists and mark priorities but if i get truly overwhelmed with volume i pick one thing and do it i like to start with something that is fairly short to complete but will make some sort of tangible difference for example putting away a pile of paperwork on my desk that needs filed its not a top priority task but doesnt take that long and has a real visual reward of seeing a big portion of my desk cleared off the satisfaction from actually completing something as opposed to just making progress toward something makes me feel less overwhelmed for studying or homework id start with something thats not too difficult or time consuming it lets you cross something off your list and gets you in work mode once you start it will be much easier to keep going
LifeProTips,not_removed,if theres so much to do that its unclear where to start then start anywhere just get moving i like writing down my goals so no matter what im doing i am working toward the end game
LifeProTips,not_removed,if the conditions are random start anywhere what difference does it make youre paralyzed by indecision and its costing time get a frigging dice and make it decide for you if you have to just start working on something okay i rolled on my little madeup reference that means physics step get physics text step start listing the stuff i had the hardest time with step start revising that
LifeProTips,not_removed,break it into chunks order chunks by priority write them down if chunks are still too big repeat on individual parts all three steps are equally important and together will help you in all kinds of aspects of your life
LifeProTips,not_removed,what the others said its the feeling of being overwhelmed that is keeping you from just starting grab one item from the list and get to it itll all fall into place after that
LifeProTips,not_removed,start at the top of the pile and work down
LifeProTips,not_removed,while many are suggesting starting anywhere i would instead suggest starting with the task or portion of a larger task that is the easiestquickest to complete you can more easily find the motivation to get going with something you know you can do and where you can see the end before youve even started than dealing with the colossal large task that seems tough to contemplate once you have one item done youre building momentum this is exercising a similar principle to the snowball method of debt repayment where rather than targeting paying down the most costly debt you instead tackle the smallest balance counting on the accomplishment of having one less line item to be concerned with providing the motivation to keep at it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont like that everyone says start anywhere or do the easiest first if you are over whelmed something is making you feel overwhelmed what is it when you try to lay down to go to sleep what are you worried about thats the thing you start on the item that you would feel terrible if it didnt get done by deadline rather that be your thesis paper your resume painting the kitchen or spending time with your kids what is it that interrupts your sleep at night do that first youll respect yourself and be successful because of it
LifeProTips,not_removed,make a list of everything you need to do and when it needs to be done then make a new to do list based on what needs to be finished soonest
LifeProTips,not_removed,prioritize on the amount of time it will take to complete each task and degree of importance do the most important and most time consuming assignment first when your brain is fresh and move down the list for example i would do my exam studying and paper revisions first and work my way down to non graded homework assignments and reading also i wouldnt sign a numerical time to the amount time it will take you to complete a task for example dont assume it will take minutes to complete a homework assignment because you might rush to complete it within the allotted time it is much better to ball park it and be flexible in case you run into any unforeseen hurdles
LifeProTips,not_removed,start by making a list list all the things you need to do to accomplish the tasks it doesnt matter if they are in order or not just get them written down you can organize them later keep writing them down until you run out of them dont kill yourself to think about each and every possible thing write down the ones that come immediately to mind once you have a list decide which one you should do first and do it then come back to the list check off the task you accomplished write down anything new that you thought of to do and try and put some order to your list which tasks are most important which are dependent or subordinate to other tasks once youve worked the list a little do another task from the list if the order doesnt matter do the easiest ones first so that you have a sense of accomplishment and overcome the inertia of being overwhelmed then keep going back to the list work on it a little do some more tasks and so on
LifeProTips,not_removed,use post it notes and prioritize the most in portent task at the top this will help you be more productive and reduce any multitasking
LifeProTips,not_removed,gantt charts can be pretty helpful with prioritising
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually just let it sit untill deadlines are long gone and face the wrath of my shitty decisions after that shrug it off and move on d pretty fuckin simple imo

LifeProTips,not_removed,this does make the people jerks but a lot of the time thats why the backpack is there
LifeProTips,not_removed,until there are no more stops wouldnt that be the terminal stop where everyone gets off im confused by the statement until there are no more stops to start the trip
LifeProTips,not_removed,for example a bus to go visit macchu pichu everybody sits down and it goes so dont put your bag down until the last moment
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt take at least one good statistics course while youre in college any time parttime its not too late introlevel statistics httpswwwkhanacademyorgmathprobability free free free free free httpswwwcourseraorgspecializationsstatistics for certificate audit individual courses for free httpswwwedxorgcoursesearchquerystatistics free click starting soon to refine data science and machine learning httpswwwdatacampcom free free free for certificate audit individual courses for free for certificate audit individual courses for free free httpswwwcourseraorgspecializationsjhudatascience for certificate audit individual courses for free
LifeProTips,not_removed,a basic understanding of statistics is extremely useful for understanding news reports advertisements and utility graphs too also it may make you sad to see how often its principles can be incorrectly applied or used to mislead
LifeProTips,not_removed,woah man i use geometry all the time dont talk shit about my geometry
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm didnt takes stats am unemployed
LifeProTips,not_removed,at the very least learn excel
LifeProTips,not_removed,i never took a statistics course and im a medical device rd engineer despite having a bsms in chemical engineering statistics is not a required course and i use it all the time on my job to show the safety and efficacy of premarket medical devices scary thing if you think about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,engineers use it too spc among other things
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres a man and a woman in the room how many boobs are there two that means the average person has one boob
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpswwwtedcomtalksarthurbenjaminsformulaforchangingmatheducationlanguageen the calculus track makes no sense if youre not in a science statistics is necessary for sciences but also to make you a capable adult misunderstanding statistics negatively impacts us in health finances politics etc etc and other ones not the one im sharing
LifeProTips,not_removed,but if you dont know multi variate calc then you dont really know statistics beyond the basics
LifeProTips,not_removed,regular math classes bored me and didnt really make any sense statistics made sense and i still use that knowledge all the time a little knowledge about statistics goes a long way to really understanding things you read and see bs dished out to the public all the time edit i do understand math algebra calculus etc i suppose i misspoke i just prefer statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,you will find statistics more useful in jobs if you do any research or analysis a good understanding of statistics will make you look smart
LifeProTips,not_removed,no even if youre an engineer youll still need stats in my experience all cs majors doubled down on calculus which i havent used much since college im learning statistics in my own now though because i manage a system that generates loads of telemetry data and id like to know which components are functioning or not how the input data varies what the uptimesla should be etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,whats the probability of using it later in life
LifeProTips,not_removed,electrician here trig and geometry are my jam statistics completely useless
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed however i had the worst stats professor in college no one knew how he became a professor my stats knowledge is horrific
LifeProTips,not_removed,do you have the stats to back this claim up and will i be able to understand them if you do
LifeProTips,not_removed,seeing as i learnt the different between median and mean in year does this not apply to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,a thousand times yes im a civil engineer after college i took an online course taught by stanford called statistical learning its free and its so fucking useful
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a math major with a stat minor nice
LifeProTips,not_removed,how to lie with statistics by darrell huff is a great little book it teaches you a load of ways to sniff out the bs of facts and statistics that people try to pull all the time a really good read if you want edgy wakeupsheeple stuff too
LifeProTips,not_removed,what stats was the least useful course ive ever had its crap
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you know that out of people make up of the population just doing my part
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics and also economics i am constantly being shocked by how little people understand the basics of supplydemand
LifeProTips,not_removed,was on the fence about taking statistics my junior or senior thanks for the tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,forget the unless engineer part they use stats too its handy all aroumd
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep i graduated with both a physics and statistics degree and boy has statistics taken me places with job interviews in fact i would suggest people take a course in nonparametric statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a machinist and a welder i only use trigonometry and geometry
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless youre an engineer statistics is probably going to be the most useful math discipline youll take actually statistics is incredibly important for engineering its how we analyze test data and are able to formulate proper testings plans on top of that its how production of a product can be monitored to ensure that every part produced will remain within tolerances calculus diffeq and the rest isnt nearly as important since just understanding how to setup integralsderivatives is enough to get you through with modern tech also it plays a huge factor in part design as we understand that when a part is given dimensions then the manufacturing method will cause a variance in the actual dimensions the tolerances need to be created so that the desired percentage of parts meets the tolerance requirements im only in my third year of engineering studies but my last internship i got was because a statistics class that my university requires that engineers take one of the guys i worked under was in charge of process engineering at that section of the company and he didnt even have an engineering degree he just had a great understanding of statistics and rootcause analysis
LifeProTips,not_removed,am engineer statistics is still the most useful branch of math edit ok ok it depends on the type of engineering im a process control engineer so its all the math i use
LifeProTips,not_removed,great lpt ill add that a good technical writing course will be put to use every day for most professionals
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics is not math my stats professor
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of my education pet peeves is that calculus is the pinnacle of high school math statistics would be a much more useful senior year course
LifeProTips,not_removed,very timely recently i was downvoted for saying was a small sample size actually it can be a useful size but its not truly representative of an entire population larger sizes of about a are highly accurate it sent me reading up on statistics and a newfound desire to relearn what i thought i knew
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistically its a good choice
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know its generally not a college class but algebra is definitely the most useful math discipline its used all the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,while i agree that almost nobody will ever actually use calculus taking calculus totally changed my appreciation of math and changed the way i see the world every day i hated math until that point but then i realized that really the reason i had to learn all that lower level shit like algebra was so i could learn calc its like if you were learning french all your life and you never understood why and never really used it then you read the most incredible mind blowing book in french and all those french classes made sense also statistics is awesome but fucking hard the human brain just doesnt get statistics and thats why we had to invent a totally new math system for it youll get answers that make no conceptual sense but are correct strange stuff
LifeProTips,not_removed,also game theory also microeconomics
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am taking an introduction to statistics course this quarter my final is next week and i find that i do really well in it most likely because its almost sort of fun i am considering taking more statistics classes i am working towards a bachelors in computer science what careers in particular are heavy on statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,medical student here we just finished a course of bio statistics i thought i would never use this stuff again and was wrong it becomes very valuable when interpreting studies and papers
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had the opportunity of taking both calculus and stats on high school and if youre choosing between the two for the love of god choose stats math is fun when it actually makes reallife sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,as an engineer looking for a job no one has ever asked me what calculus i know but they have asked me if i knew process statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,after taking stats i found that i could interpret and understand research studies so much more clearly it was refreshing being able to differentiate both the effect and the size of that effect to determine significance especially in relation to new psychopharmacological treatments you really have to read research closely as to not be misled about every new drug out there
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of the better lpts ive read
LifeProTips,not_removed,engineers learn statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a engineer and the first months of my employment was teaching me statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh my god statistics for business only c i got in college one of the few classes i really had to work at and still didnt do well i used not one bit of that in my career
LifeProTips,not_removed,even engineers benefit from it in some fields of engineering you can easily gather tonns of data and analyzing it isnt only cool its beneficial
LifeProTips,not_removed,question for anyone who might know i struggled through a degree in a statsintensive field of study i understand much of it conceptually but i struggle with actually using it can anyone recommend any online courses or projects i can take on to help fix that stuff like khan or youtube videos that ive seen teach that conceptual side im already strong in i think im looking for a structured or practical way to practice
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm almost done with phd in stats am employed but seriously i watched a good ted talk where this guy argued that statistics should be taught in high school beforeinstead of calculus because of the wide teaching applications of it
LifeProTips,not_removed,actually as an engineer statistics is super important to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,as an ie i couldnt agree anymore
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics is useful for engineers
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always find that the most useful math skill that i ever learned was in grade cross multiplication i cant tell you how many times in my life ive solved for x by cross multiplying and having people stand around like im some sort of math wizard its so easy so useful and so many people dont remember how to do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,a retired friend of mine who was a professor of computational linguistics was ardent that statistics should be required perhaps even more so than physics
LifeProTips,not_removed,it really enhances critical thinking skills after statistics class i now question the method and results of every study i read about in the news
LifeProTips,not_removed,are there any good online courses
LifeProTips,not_removed,anyone suggest a good place to learn statistics online
LifeProTips,not_removed,i totally agree in fact david halberstam recounts in his book the reckoning how a picture of w e deming author of stastical method hung in japanese classrooms control charts are a valuable tool for guaging productivity
LifeProTips,not_removed,even if you dont have the time to take a college course khan academy has a great video series on statistics httpswwwkhanacademyorgmathprobability
LifeProTips,not_removed,mean and median in a college statistics course ive just taken both required business statistics in my university and it was unbelievably difficult at times i wish i was taught more on mean median and mode
LifeProTips,not_removed,good call majored in political science with a minor in russian language after being unemployed a year ended up doing military contracting in afghanistan and now somehow im in middle management in public transport for the disabled literally the only thing of value that came out my college years was using excel and doing statistics and the russian was handy for bullshitting with kyrgyzstani contractors but other than that
LifeProTips,not_removed,even if you are an engineer statistics is incredibly useful im a midcareer engineer and to this day i regret never taking a formal stats course i constantly mull over enrolling in one at my local jc
LifeProTips,not_removed,just graduated with a stat minor even though a low level stats class is useful for everyone most people assume stats is easy after taking it its a low level basic stats class after all nevertheless i encourage anyone to take mathematical statistics where calculus is crucial thats where things get interesting
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics is a great discipline to learn i used a linear regression to find the best deal on a car recently and it saved me like
LifeProTips,not_removed,funny story im a mathematics phd student and i will be taking my first ever statistics course in my second year of the program
LifeProTips,not_removed,to add on to op most universities science courses cover statistics at a very basic level oftentimes too basic but its a good foundation but psychology majors will encounter much more statistics units than you may expect which is why businesses sometimes prefer psych majors for job postings that need statistical analysis source psych and business major with work experience
LifeProTips,not_removed,many people specifically politicians the media even college professors etc deceitfully use the term average knowing that their audience will associate it with arithmetic mean when in fact they may be referring to a median or mode or some other kind of average so it is good to at least understand the differences and not be fooled
LifeProTips,not_removed,for those not in college khan academy has a pretty good statistics course httpswwwkhanacademyorgmathprobability
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics and probability is used so much in engineering so you should learn it even if you are studying engineering this is why most curriculums include a probability or statistics course
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm was chemistry major skated away with only a single statistics class that i didnt really bother to pay real attention to because to me i was taking it as math filler that i didnt think id need i ended up an analytical chemist it would have been way easier if i had had a better stats background i had to do a lot of relearning in order to do my job
LifeProTips,not_removed,also dont assume your professor knows their shit just sign up for the class and then do the khan academy to teach yourself the material i have run into a lot of shit statistics professors of the years including one that didnt know the difference between median and mean in fact this is probably just good advice in general everyone should go do the khan academy courses on statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,hold up my public school taught us statisticsprobability in and grade the same exact class just to make sure we got it through our hormone addled brains
LifeProTips,not_removed,also basic programming classes people say that you dont use calculus in the real world but you totally do if you have any job that requires you to use critical thinking
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a computer engineer and i use probability much more often than i use calculus
LifeProTips,not_removed,i failed miserably at statistics in high school fuck
LifeProTips,not_removed,good thing statistics was the hardest class ive ever taken with a textbook that seemed to be written in a different language and a teacher who moved at the speed of light and was no help i got a d
LifeProTips,not_removed,is there a goodgreat online course i can take video i can watch on statistics need to bootstrap into this subject
LifeProTips,not_removed,if nothing else it letd you know that of of poll based news articles are bullshit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i deal with pressure related instrumentation that generally has a output signal relatable to the pressure reading and i am often surprised by the substantial difference between percent of reading vs percent of span when at the low end of the range math is a hell of a drug
LifeProTips,not_removed,so for those of us who cant afford more college links to free learning resources
LifeProTips,not_removed,also good if you want to find a job somewhere in a statfriendly mlb club sabermetrics have been changing the game since the as started it in the early now pretty much every major club has someone in the front office who crunches more and more numbers texas st louis lad atlanta boston chicago c all at the top of my head are very statoriented clubs
LifeProTips,not_removed,computer engineering and molecular biology student here ive been taking stats since high school and use it quite often just the class itself forces you to be logical and ethical while using some math its like psychology basic math put together would disagree about the unless youre an engineer part i work for tech at the moment and we constantly use stats to think about the customers we could attract or how people use our products stats is applicable everywhere and its easy enough to take at a community college or even khan academy
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics are about who can pay the most to spread the lie
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think i could afford it and its not in my program does anyone know a good mooc free or paid
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless its mathematical stats as i took i learned a lot about how to use calculus in statistics and a decent amount of background theory but i could never apply any of it to real life since we did no realistic examples ex i learned a lot about probability distributions and i still have no idea how you get one from an experiment without the question literally saying this comes from the name distribution
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistically hes right
LifeProTips,not_removed,how about people not just give up on math after taking intro to college math youre right you will never need to find the divergence of a vector field in real life but math is about a lot more than that math is a way of thinking a method for approaching problems from a position of pure logic knowing how to approach problems is a valuable skill for everyone i am also tired of listening to people complain about how difficult math is yea there are some people out there that struggle with it because their minds simply do not operate that way but the vast majority of complaints i hear are from people who are just lazy im sorry its not straight memorization like history its more akin to learning to play the piano math takes practice you have to sit down and do it over and over again until you are good at it you cant just read the book and expect to magic an a on the test math takes time endrant
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always get so discouraged when people say calculus or geometry isnt used in real life like maybe if you actually learned it youd use it basic stats is the easiest hard math class of all time no phd level stats is not easy hence the word basic you would not believe how many times i have used euclidean geometry to prove something could be done for instance the radius of a door swinging and not hitting a dresser behind it because its angle is restricted ever wanted to optimize profits against employee overhead and demand create stat plot regression derivative set equal to zero aaaand youve just determined your maximum profitability its not maths fault that you were partying instead of studying p
LifeProTips,not_removed,its amazing how few people have a basic understanding of stats i read a bill in the us senate the other day that said percent of people are in the percentile heaviest of bodyweight or higher
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was about to retire from the army and didnt have my degree yet the education counselor said i should get a degree in sociology since i could take some test that would give me most of the credits and that the sociology test had the lowest passing score i literally didnt even know what sociology was but took the test cold and passed because quite a bit of it was statistical math which i had learned in the one year of regular college i attended
LifeProTips,not_removed,its also the liberal arts of math and can be interpreted any which way medicine is a field notorious for statistics abuse and stretching uninformative statistics until they fit something meaningful regardless of the realities
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if im not in college is it hopeless
LifeProTips,not_removed,my graduate school quantitative analysis course included a second textbook how to lie with statistics the course and that second book have stayed the course with me over the years
LifeProTips,not_removed,and as a bonus it will destroy your soul your sooooooooouuuuul
LifeProTips,not_removed,i failed a stat course does that count
LifeProTips,not_removed,iam doing stats in my high school as part of my maths course as someone interested in a medical career how important is stats i can see how its important but will it really make that much of an impact
LifeProTips,not_removed,so i didnt do it and now regret it does anyone know of free online courses that could help teach stats
LifeProTips,not_removed,for those out of school do you have a suggestion for a good mooc or online stats course
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wish theyd require students in high school to take statistics my daughter was told not to take ap statistics because good colleges prefer ap calculus statistics is so much more useful for every day life
LifeProTips,not_removed,youll never use calculus if you take a good statistics course youll use calculus taking statistics without a basic understanding of calculus is a bit like studying baseball without learning how to pitch or hit
LifeProTips,not_removed,id agree to the likely value but unfortunately theres a lot of variation in quality and it can sometimes be a bit hard to judge quality if you dont know the material already do your due diligence as much as you can this applies to any course really course content teaching standard etc etc try to get some input from disinterested people that know a good deal more than you dont pick one because it looks easy to pass if youre doing it to learn something valuable a good one probably wont be easy not uninterested i mean people without a stake in what you choose also statistics courses tend to be very conceptdense and given the usually relatively easy mathematics a lot of people underestimate the subtleties that come into it including many people teaching it ive seen many basic texts by people coming to statistics from other areas which contain many flatoutwrong statements and some very popular books in some particular application areas are brimfull of errors
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree on never using calculus and geometry i build shit that requires both all the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,a median is the statistical value found with an equal number of factors above and below it while mean is you are a worthless piece of shit kills yourself faggot
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont listen to this guy take a good methodology course so you get the basics of stats without the rest of the bullcrap
LifeProTips,not_removed,biometry has only taught me how useless statistics actually are
LifeProTips,not_removed,especially for biology students bone up on those stats classes if you want to get those reu internships your chances at getting selected skyrocket if the board sees those on your transcript
LifeProTips,not_removed,somehow i managed to get a degree in math without ever taking a statistics course i fucked up
LifeProTips,not_removed,i took a stats class in undergrad and got a but i still dont feel i have a very good understanding i feel like i just learned how to plug a bunch of numbers into a calculator and fill in the right bubble on my tests
LifeProTips,not_removed,even engineers get some use out of statistics say you need parts to fit together of the time you can use statistics to figure out how much of an average difference there needs to be that was just an example
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats because life is filled with things we are uncertain about and things we expect to happen but have reasonable fears that they might not happen the way we hope that they might statistics is the mathematical discipline that allows us to talk about these brutal truths with some degree of equanimity and clarity everything else is counting with our fingers
LifeProTips,not_removed,i took statistics i still dont understand statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,and ive had quite a few people tell me that they were terrible in other math classes but fantastic in statistics so dont be too intimidated if youre not much of a math person
LifeProTips,not_removed,i majored in statistics pls hire me
LifeProTips,not_removed,a course in microsoft office mainly focused on excel will teach you the rest of what you need to apply this knowledge
LifeProTips,not_removed,and what about if youre already out of college anyone know of any good single online courses from accredited colleges
LifeProTips,not_removed,fun fact there are also some cool models for helping learn stats if you learn better with tactical aids
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm met wife in stats class she makes lotsa money and is a great wife mother
LifeProTips,not_removed,follow up also make sure you pay attention in stats class
LifeProTips,not_removed,advanced stats has a lot of applied calc was definitely one of the hardest math classes i had to take for my cs degree
LifeProTips,not_removed,meh i mean i feel like computer science is vastly relevant for most jobs these days
LifeProTips,not_removed,naked statistics by wheelan is a decent book it explains statistic concepts very meaningful sorry it is despite the title sfw
LifeProTips,not_removed,algebra and geometry is useful as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,what does it even teach in math class all we did for statistics was do graphs not learning much just doing math labour like when we had to do subtraction questions in grade
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre an idiot of the curriculum is made up
LifeProTips,not_removed,please for the love of god do this i work in business intelligence and there is nothing more frustrating than seeing capable leaders in an organization not understand basic statistics if i have to explain to you what being standard deviations from mean means then im concerned about your ability to utilize metrics to manage your office i am constantly begging for someone to put me out of a job but apparently statistics are the devil for many very accomplished people with big data making a huge push and metrics being tracked everywhere stats are a must know this is the way of the future my friends so get on board
LifeProTips,not_removed,take a low level stats course
LifeProTips,not_removed,what are the stats on that though
LifeProTips,not_removed,hope this makes it so everyone can see it but i agree with this lpt but hope to hell none of you are tortured with this video a video that both my stats and advanced research statistics professors insisted on showing us psi apologize ahead of time for just how bad this is and for anyone that was forced to relive seeing this im sorry
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha im in statistics class right now for my mba applied managerial decisionmaking
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a bs in physics and never had to take a statistics course but really wish i did anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a software developer at a data science company i should really do some stats
LifeProTips,not_removed,thinking fast and slow by daniel kahnman is a really good book to read beforehand too to understand just how important statistics is
LifeProTips,not_removed,word im riding the living shit out of this advice and doing a stat ma
LifeProTips,not_removed,couldnt agree more i didnt pay too much attention to statistics and probability at university and am now having to relearn everything and am even thinking about getting a degree in statistics because of how useful it is
LifeProTips,not_removed,machine learning is a really hot field right now across all sorts of professions including medicine law and commerce and its just statistics dressed up in fancy clothes
LifeProTips,not_removed,stats was the college class i did the worst in it was still the most useful class i have ever taken
LifeProTips,not_removed,also take some type of logic course i found that it helped me immensely with my entire college career with writing concise logical papers
LifeProTips,not_removed,excellent advice best part its not as hard as you may think
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think its more accurate to say that most people can use some basic aspects of stats but very few people need to learn most aspects youd get from a full college course in fact the same can be said for calculus and geometry which youre so quick to dismiss tldr op seems to be rather biased toward one area of math and wants everyone to believe that what he took in college is more important than what anyone else took in college
LifeProTips,not_removed,understanding statistics is also vitally important for the practice of scientific skepticism simple concepts like probability can help you avoid common logical fallacies like the gamblers fallacy it will lead you to proper arguments against creationists bigfoot enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists statistics are great pro tips for your life
LifeProTips,not_removed,you ever try matching tupperware lids or moving a couch around a corner without geometry
LifeProTips,not_removed,grrr i finished my required math credits without having to take stats here i thought stats was inferior to calculus because it was either stats or calc that would complete my math credit curriculum as i finished that i told myself i dont need another math class to graduate let alone statistics might want to reconsider statistics again in the future
LifeProTips,not_removed,as an algebra teacher i always start off the school year with saying i am going to show you things that you will probably never use in life lines quadratics absolute value functions unless youre an algebra teacher you will probably never see these again it prevents those midyear when are we going to use this in life questions however when i do get those i rebut by saying that im teaching them how to logic their way through things which will hopefully help them in life
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless youre an engineer pro tip even engineers go into sales and management knowing statistics and having some form of financial training is essential
LifeProTips,not_removed,all my statistics professors said though statistics is not math
LifeProTips,not_removed,lin alg has gotta be the most useful edit nevermind am engineer
LifeProTips,not_removed,this guy really helped me alot i ended up buying the book he was using and doing some of the work on my own i plan on watching his statistics videos after i finish with the algebra video
LifeProTips,not_removed,id go so far as to say its the most useful discipline for just humans in general nothing to do with what profession youre in any time a doctor tries to explain something to you any time a salesman tries to sell you something any time a politician tries to get you angry or excited about something theres a very good chance theyre going to throw some statistics at you without a basic grasp of how they work you can easily be misled or confused when you really really dont want to be
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hated statistics and i had to take three courses for my degree
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have to take two
LifeProTips,not_removed,trying to start a career in analytical chemistry can confirm
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics is useless for most jobs your job most jobs
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics is love statistics is life
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who is currently doing a basic stats paper and fucking hating it its making my life miserable but i do agree this will be useful
LifeProTips,not_removed,difference between median and mean haha my statisics for engineers course only touched the concept of the medium once when discussing making box plots by hand by the week we were off in abstract statistics land deriving second moments of gamma distributions and doing maximum likelihood estimates
LifeProTips,not_removed,for engineering its probably linear algebra if anyones interested
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless youre an engineer really understanding big data and knowing how to interpret data is a major part of engineering
LifeProTips,not_removed,heck even in engineering stats is incredibly useful i didnt realise this until i hit final year and everything turned into stats that ir sensor youve been assuming is accurate yep you should use stats for it that digital signal you thought was perfect nope its got all sorts of nasty business going on calculus etc is still useful but anything realistic will need stats somewhere along the way the real world isnt perfect after all
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck statistics and fuck you ok now that that is out of my system i just hated statistics because every time i took it different variants the first half of the class was basically this is statistics and how to use it and why it is very important the second half of the class was learning that statistics and studies are very inaccurate and can be made to say whatever you want
LifeProTips,not_removed,anyone interested in doing rd type work should absolutely learn as much statistics and design of experiments as possible im currently applying for industry research jobs out of grad school and almost every one requires some form of doe and sas jmp minitab etc knowledge being able to talk intelligently about factors responses effects anova fractional factorial designs surface response optimization etc has been hugely beneficial during interviews as well as useful for my actual research
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a math major i would agree if you dont want to take a class that demands calculus then take combinatorics
LifeProTips,not_removed,i remember when my teacher in high school was using statistics in various reallife scenarios one was that the space shuttle was due to explode then it happened the next semester also that one of the kids from our graduating class would likely die in a car accident by graduation the girl who later died in a crash sat next to me in that very stats class so i learned early in life how important stats are it seriously left a big impression on me and led to me becoming a very strategic thinking person—probably to a fault
LifeProTips,not_removed,i find algebra to be infinitely more useful in daytoday business but stats are definitely legit
LifeProTips,not_removed,took it about years ago even got a for it remember almost nothing form that course not pro life tip that was
LifeProTips,not_removed,as somebody that works in business valuations and successions basic accounting are close seconds so close theyre almost first
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would definitely agree my knowledge of statistics up through multiple linear regression analysis has come in handy numerous times over years as a software developer not directly in terms of helping to write code but in understanding a problem space and the data and making sure the software does something useful ive also used statistics math in some realworld situations
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre not in college it would be beneficial to read up on how statistics work anyway you dont want to make a fool of yourself by misrepresenting stats
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone with a ms in aerospace engineering statistics is definitely the most important branch of mathematics to know every measurement prediction and model has some degree of uncertainty and its important to be able to estimate whether extra reinforcement or whatever is really worth the cost anyone can build a bridge but only an engineer can build a bridge that just barely doesnt fall down
LifeProTips,not_removed,well shit and here i was thinking of dropping it this summer can anyone recommend a good subreddit for help i cant use my hands to write at all and am really nervous because if i remember correctly being able to write out freehand abstract expressions is really important when it comes to math
LifeProTips,not_removed,it may be but even if you take the class youd just forget it if you didnt stay up with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,coincidentally i was going to forego statistics since i have already had to take business calc for my major but now my college is initiating a bachelors program in my major which does require statistics so it looks like ill be taking statistics cant wait
LifeProTips,not_removed,economists in my college go through six statistics courses the first two are about the three main branches of statistics then econometrics i and ii then time cycles and time series pretty tough shit all right pretty powerful tool
LifeProTips,not_removed,i took stats classes in college yeah it comes up a lot
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a wildlife biologist and took a few statistics courses and my main lesson that i took from those classes is to hire a statistician when you need one
LifeProTips,not_removed,im taking it in high school right now and im happy i did
LifeProTips,not_removed,is accounting or finance mathbecause those are just way more useful
LifeProTips,not_removed,good to know before i take a psychology and social sciences stats class this summer kinda looking forward to it now
LifeProTips,not_removed,calculus is good
LifeProTips,not_removed,and in case you didnt take it in college httpswwwkhanacademyorgmathprobability
LifeProTips,not_removed,most useful statistically speaking of course
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics is great for fleecing your friends in poker
LifeProTips,not_removed,im surprised how few people understand standard deviation
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics is one of the most important fields to learn as an engineer six sigma and quality control projects are based entirely around statistics in fact a lot of the statistical methods we use today were designed in order to improve quality in manufacturing
LifeProTips,not_removed,isnt that the truth
LifeProTips,not_removed,what a load of nonsense lockhart laments ❤ from mathematicians
LifeProTips,not_removed,finance is another good option and is considered math
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you i was looking for a reply like this for those of us that missed out on good a stats course
LifeProTips,not_removed,perfect was looking for this
LifeProTips,not_removed,real mvp in the thread
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am a statistician i hold a phd i cant tell you how many times people try to educate me on statistics and probability when they took a statistics course and never let me get a word in statistics is a very broad field there is time series analysis multivariate analysis nonparametric statistics bayesian statistics deep learning machine learning sampling theory data mining stochastic processes design of experiments etc the worst ones are the people who always say but correlation doesnt imply causation or those who tell me some facts about how to increase your odds of winning the lottery with some stupid idea
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is true but most people who take one class will still have really very little understanding on statistics source one of my advanced degrees is in statistics and i was a teaching assistant
LifeProTips,not_removed,this so much this i was a moronic veganantigmoproorganic teenager until i learned how to analyze research studies still had zero background in science but that one class taught me how or easy to find numbers in a page study will tell me if they were intentionally misleading the reader
LifeProTips,not_removed,i run an election projection website benchmark politics and the daily deluge of terrible general stats info i get everyday is saddening among the worst lately is the statistical tie
LifeProTips,not_removed,what job
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck your proofs
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you probabilitied you would have a job probably
LifeProTips,not_removed,i on the other hand did major in statistics and i am unemployed
LifeProTips,not_removed,correlation does not imply causation if youd taken a stats course you would have known that
LifeProTips,not_removed,what are the odds of that
LifeProTips,not_removed,next best thing to statistics is to make up stuff dont give up
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am a college drop out and thanks to nepotism i have a nice job you should have invested your time and money into having a better family rather than education
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have two jobs statistically between us both of us have a job
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed math is about learning to think logically and solve problems what us more useful than that
LifeProTips,not_removed,recent math major grad here and i really agree with all of this im in financial services now doing stats heavy work but pure math classes are what really taught me to think at a level of depth and creativity that has helped me in unexpected ways even just learning how to write clean clear proofs improved my ability to communicate in general i also agree that stats seems distinctly different from math in the sense that the way the op is phrasing it stats is being applied rather than studied i guess its more about being able to interpret polls and studies correctly i took one class that was applied stats to learn what confidence intervals are and all that but i recall my mathematical statistics class being more proof based i got different things out of both classes both of which have helped me career wise but in distinctly different ways
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree but math at lower levels which is what of the people learn isnt really math you are talking about its largely just memorization and computation and you can put your questions in a calculator to get the answer its important to learn this basic math too but its not what would make math great for most people what people need to learn is logic which is what really makes math once you go past calculus and start doing proofs i think that learning introductory formal logic would be extremely helpful for anyone and can usually help a lot with inductive reasoning used all the time in writing economics research of any kind and statistics which are tools used for deductiveinductive reasoning
LifeProTips,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better i took a lot of math in university because a friend of mine was majoring in it and conned me into taking it with her all the time subsequently i had the math chops to teach myself a bunch of advanced statistical methods later on when my job required it math is fun though vector calculus made no sense to me until i found an application of it in my work life
LifeProTips,not_removed,idk mate i use math quite a lot in programming math is fucking fun
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is precisely it statistics as my dad would say is the least mathiest of the maths if youve done calculus linear algebra and cs its easy to be frightened by the big formulas higherlevel math notation algorithms etc but in stats its really on the border between s and m of stem much more stuck to reality in the eyes of a typical student however to those saying calc wont be used later on in their careers what a silly statement say for example common applications of math such as business medical science engineering economics etchow can you not use calc its bound to be there perhaps specific disciplines have an easier approach to teaching how to study rates of change so you dont knowrealize that its really calc besides its important to understand the various topics of math people are saying stats is applicable to many things which is true but overlook the fact that even a statistician has to have contextual knowledge to apply it really you dont know what youre saying if you claim that calc is useless
LifeProTips,not_removed,as an educator linguistics and composition thank you so much for stating statistics and math are different fields so often the freshmen i teach confuse this hell some of my colleagues in the english dept also confuse them its tragic really
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had students who took abstract math classes out of curiosity or for fun what classes your post made me interested in what higher math classes i could take to broaden my interest in mathematics as a second year engineering student id love to study some abstract maths on the side
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes but for those of us that can barely pass college algebra what other choice do we have
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree with some parts and disagree with other math should develop your thinking up to high school what you learn in college should be stuff you will need in your field also it is nice to teach math as a way to develop thinking the problem is that is usually not thaught that way most teacher want you know the math stuff and dont care how your thinking is progressing personally i think math is thaught absolutely wrong in most places
LifeProTips,not_removed,if we can get of college students to take a stats class and learn nothing other than that methods exist to determine our level of confidence in a hypothesis in the face of imperfect data then thatll be mission accomplished if instead people take abstract vector spaces for example the only takehome knowledge they might retain years down the road is that theres a lot of complicated math out there
LifeProTips,not_removed,the goal of math is to develop thinking not to acquire formulas as a physics professor thank you for saying this same is true of physics
LifeProTips,not_removed,is there any proof that math develops mind this idea is a strongly held axiom worldwide which has caused forceful insertion of math as a subject in many courses and examinations as well as making it a part of qualification for many entrances
LifeProTips,not_removed,ramble time i took one bad statistic course in college our teacher forced us to struggle through it all manually then showed us the entire course in about an hour on the last day of the term in excel he literally opened the textbook and went through chapter by chapter recreating everything in a spreadsheet that was the lowest grade i ever received in college and while i passed i immediately pushed it out of my brain due to frustration to me statistics was much less about math than it was about nonintuitive concepts involving numbers im not sure that makes any sense but im not bad at math and it was like another world to me at the time the most mathematically intense course i ever took was an astronomy class of all things a one credit hour summer elective i needed to graduate i did well but remember thinking i was in for an easy few weeks staring at stars in the middle of a cornfield until we got our first assignments i probably took more math away from that class than a lot of the other math courses ive had as a software guy of the time if im doing calculations theyre extremely rudimentary in the event i need more complex maths ive yet to have a problem looking it up understanding the basics of what i need in a few minutes and reusing existing code i forget where i was going with all this but yeah excel
LifeProTips,not_removed,holy shit i genuinely thought i had made that up when i took stats
LifeProTips,not_removed,arent we learning the p is near useless as we use it today
LifeProTips,not_removed,rbadpharma type of scary yeah usually those folks know enough to be able to manipulate results
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think the point was that engineers also use the other math disciplines
LifeProTips,not_removed,i prefer a person on average had one testicle
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you really took stats youd know theres no average only mean
LifeProTips,not_removed,the median also has boob
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres more than pope per in the vatican city
LifeProTips,not_removed,men have boobs
LifeProTips,not_removed,math doesnt serve the sole purpose of providing skills but also provides usefull ways of thinking just like i dont say anthropology is useless to me even though i wont explicitly use it in my work you shouldnt say calculus is makes no sense if you arent in science
LifeProTips,not_removed,a pvalue in a classic ttest arguably the most commonly used part of all of statistics is the integral over students tdistribution basic linear regression is formulated in terms of the derivative of the loss function how in the world are you going to understand any meaningful statistics if you dont understand calculus misunderstanding of statistics is just as bad as not knowing it sometimes worse if you dont know calculus you cannot possibly understand statistics in a nondangerous way calculus while typically taught poorly is also a wonderful entrance into thinking maturely about mathematics there are other paths to getting there cs major typically do this through discrete mathematics but if you cannot understand derivatives and integrals youll likely be unable to reason properly about statistics parroting the formulas in your statistics book is exactly the reason were having huge issue in psychology research today
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics is necessary for sciences but also to make you a capable adult i failed stats in college twice so this whole thing makes a lot of sense now
LifeProTips,not_removed,stats teacher here i always tell kids they should take stats and to be honest even if a person is planning on going into a math based discipline they should wait to take calculus from the university professor making a connection with uni professors is much more important than getting calculus out of the way in high school
LifeProTips,not_removed,tbh if you dont know real analysis then you dont know statistics beyond the basics that doesnt mean it isnt useful
LifeProTips,not_removed,statistics made sense wtf
LifeProTips,not_removed,i really like probability but statistics was something i wish i has a better grasp of
LifeProTips,not_removed,i doubt you understand statistics if you do not understand mathematics many stochastic processes results will go against common intuition
LifeProTips,not_removed,stats makes sense but all the little fucking variables drive me nuts once you get into the more advanced stuff thankfully i can just tell sas to do my bitch work with broad commands and not have to worry about shit so long as im clear on what im inputting
LifeProTips,not_removed,same i suck at calculus and geometry statistics really intrigued me which is why i made an active effort to understand it
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed im a comp sci major and i chose to go the ba route rather than the bs rather than take physics and normal calculus i got to take applied calculus and statistics elitist types would tell you that its stupid math or easy calc but in reality i just learned how i might actually use something i learned rather than learning how to solve differential equations using eigenvectors
LifeProTips,not_removed,as an engineer even if its skewed to make shit look more valuable nothing makes it easier to get a project approved than taking data trends adding some stats graphing them stats business talking heads love that shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes but the most useful math class for engineers is unlikely to be stats as a cs major the most useful classes were either discrete mathgraph theory or linear algebra stats were very useful but i could see myself doing my job without it i couldnt do my job without either of the two classes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work as an intern at an engineering firm and i cant express how useful it is to know how to do some form of statistics data reconciliation being able to tell a client which of their sensors in a unit arent working properly with confidence almost guarantees a contract renewal
LifeProTips,not_removed,engineers use stars all the time design of experiments is everywhere
LifeProTips,not_removed,engineer teacher says stats is pretty much all he does at work
LifeProTips,not_removed,either you do or you dont right
LifeProTips,not_removed,youd have to take it to know
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,interesting every resistor ive seen has an indicator for tolerance i imagine transmission lines have the same type of variability
LifeProTips,not_removed,read the schaums outlines for probability and statistics they go a long way to helping sort yourself out also review the khan academy lectures on the subject because probability is very counterintuitive if you know what central limit theorem is what a ttest is and when to use it and how to find a z score for a normally distributed thing then you have most of the major uses people have for stats there is a ton more but that covers the big honking things that most people are worried about
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can easily study statistics on your own if you have the motivation its not a new field but it does suck if youre not interested in it
LifeProTips,not_removed,same here i took big boy stats with the engineers and decided i didnt know fuckall so im taking more to figure out what i dont know ill be damned if my prof didnt convince me that the subject was incredibly useful it actually looks like ill officially be a statistician in a year under his mentorship
LifeProTips,not_removed,or things that are elastic and inelastic maybe that person doesnt need that extra case of dr pepper by god they need that heart medicine
LifeProTips,not_removed,or trade
LifeProTips,not_removed,probably because supply and demand isnt basic like the bro economists make out to be
LifeProTips,not_removed,am engineer have not used statistics since college
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm tldr many applications artificial intelligence and machine learning start with bayes theorem braincomputer interfaces are all statisticsfrom the expected side effects of the device materials over time to the confidence that a detected neural event isnt noise or a different actual event mechanical engineering includes choosing factors where materials have a predetermined probability of structural failure after x cycles choice of optimal manufacturing processes depends on expected tolerance cost ranges deformation part life cs briefly touches on why you shuffle before quicksort the odds of sorting slower than best case n log n are infinitesimal for large n expected server load customer throughput medical treatments military maneuvers and electrical component selection involve various types of statistics most engineering publications with data will need statistical significance for meaningful results even when shopping most people make unconscious value judgments about whether the price is the lowest expected for the amount of effort required ie driving across town or waiting for the amazon drone i cant really recommend a statistics course unless it gets into practical application but you will want to know the basics as a student and young professional eg how to interpret and explain data
LifeProTips,not_removed,i finally understood and appreciated statistics when it was explained to me that stats is a science in and of its own
LifeProTips,not_removed,i never thought about this before but this is a super good point calculus is essential for a lot of hard science careers but statistics would teach way more people how to adult
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of my education pet peeves is that calculus is the pinnacle of high school math in the us when russians are taking it in like grade
LifeProTips,not_removed,i mean it depends on the application just for example if youre estimating the mean of a quantity where the standard deviation is gets you a margin of error of about which might be fine depending on how much precision you need going to instead only gets you down to ± maybe thats a lot better again depends on the problem but you have to quadruple the sample size to shrink your confidence interval by half to be honest for the vast majority of things id downvote you too for that
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is entirely dependent on your population variance if you know for certain that your population has no variance eg everyone is the same height has the same political opinion or some other characteristic a sample size of one is all you need however as your population variance increases range of heights or political opinions etc you need to increase your sample size to better estimate the population mean
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats so funny ive taken several statistic courses last one professor recommended n
LifeProTips,not_removed,if the population is only then would be a more than ample sample size
LifeProTips,not_removed,is the minimum size to deem something significant according to the cfa
LifeProTips,not_removed,the sample size that you need to sufficiently power your analysis depends on the size of the population among other things you cant say that a certain sample size is large or small generally speaking
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think if we are being technical in statistics is considered a large sample size i was taught that a sample size of around or less is considered a small sample size that could be just in terms of a students t and normal distribution however im a little hazy on my statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,machine learning for one is increasingly focusing on probabilistic methods that require an understanding of probability theory
LifeProTips,not_removed,khan academy is a good source and another poster mentioned above about there being a free statistics course online taught by stanford university ill look into it as well hope it helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,insufficient data fail more courses then ask again
LifeProTips,not_removed,you must have used it though like in quantum mechanics after all it is a fairly fundamental part of it
LifeProTips,not_removed,moving a couch around a corner without geometry pivot
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you know you can increase your odds of winning the lottery by buying a ticket for every combination of numbers
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am a statistician i hold a phd i cant tell you how many times come on now you can tell us exactly how many times
LifeProTips,not_removed,i minored in statistics which means that i know enough about stats to never talk about stats around other people i know enough to know i dont know enough to talk about them intelligently its nice to be able to understand what other people are saying when they talk about stats though i have that going for me which is nice
LifeProTips,not_removed,correlation doesnt imply causation but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing look over there
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah those people who say but correlation doesnt imply causation bother me the most too so remind me why they bother me
LifeProTips,not_removed,correlation does not imply causation was that a test did i pass
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant tell you how many times people try to educate me on statistics could you put that in a statistic please
LifeProTips,not_removed,how can a person with just that background engage in a discussion or make intelligent decisions based in the conclusions from studies that use stats i get how frustrating it must be to be schooled by lay lersonbut wondering how those who in good faith want to have realitybased conversation can use stats responsibly
LifeProTips,not_removed,but like there are reds in a row on the roulette table probability says the next one has to be black i hear something like this a lot then what i suggest they just bet everything on black they hesitate
LifeProTips,not_removed,hmm am i still right to think that correlation doesnt mean causation like a correlation implies there maybe a relationship but not necessarily causation or is there something i am missing because i say something to that effect occasionally
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpcoreecuedupsycwuenschkstathelpcorrelationcausationhtm
LifeProTips,not_removed,so i only took intro to stats what is the issue with correlation doesnt imply causation i understand that correlated things can certainly be the cause as a general rule though isnt it best to assume correlation doesnt indicate the cause unless there is further information to prove it
LifeProTips,not_removed,the worst ones are the people who always say but correlation doesnt imply causation while i generally agree that people use this like a magic charm youd be a fool to ignore how often it is relevant to remind people that causation is a much stronger claim that correlation with much higher burden of proof
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who has a light background in stats from a while ago what numbers are you looking for specifically besides sample size
LifeProTips,not_removed,how would a better understanding of statistics change your views on veganism isnt that one more of an ethical standpoint
LifeProTips,not_removed,or someone with a phd interpreted the numbers differently than someone who took stats its good to be critical but sometimes the best conclusion about some claim you read is an unsure one
LifeProTips,not_removed,foodbabe related naturalnews
LifeProTips,not_removed,this so much this i was a moronic veganantigmoproorganic teenager until i learned how to analyze research studies im genuinely curious as to how analyzing research studies changed you are you implying you are no longer a veganantigmoproorganic person or that you are no longer moronic
LifeProTips,not_removed,geometry teacher
LifeProTips,not_removed,carpentry chemistry engineering physics plumbing and so on basically anything where you need to think about how things relate to each other in space as a student of math and chemistry i find that i use actual geometry and geometric type thinking constantly orientation is very important when thinking about reactions for chemistry
LifeProTips,not_removed,he works at the geometry factory
LifeProTips,not_removed,geometer
LifeProTips,not_removed,geometrist
LifeProTips,not_removed,geography
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a designer graphic professionally though also a hobbyist woodworker i am more grateful for my knowledge of geometry over any other math discipline every project requires problem solving with some weird angle and joinery
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you make anything physical you need basic geometry sewing carpentry heck even rearranging your living room
LifeProTips,not_removed,architecture how would they design structures without geometry
LifeProTips,not_removed,proofs are literally the most fun i ever had in any math class idk i may be in the minority though
LifeProTips,not_removed,with confidence
LifeProTips,not_removed,probabibibly
LifeProTips,not_removed,this advice works of the time every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,you dont have to be so mean about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,new study based on two people said on the internet about one point of their life but were not telling you that proves that everyone is unemployed both groups of people who did and did not take statistics are unemployed this then leads to a bunch of blogs and facebook groups perpetuating bs and somehow people are against vaccines and people are dying
LifeProTips,not_removed,tons of jobs out there for people in statistics whats wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is not gw as far as i can tell
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is probably one of my favorite xkcds of all time so much meaning packed into such a simple strip
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is my favorite one about how correlation does not imply causation
LifeProTips,not_removed,either you are employed or you are not chances of winning in the lottery win or lose
LifeProTips,not_removed,ehhh depends on the stats you use for signal processing related stats its all about probability distribution models and doing integrals to find different moments or other ways of interpreting data
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of the most useful examples when explaining this to someone modus ponens if it rains my cat gets wet it has rained so my cat is wet modus bonehead my cat is wet therefore it has rained
LifeProTips,not_removed,realistically that is what happens unfortunately ideally people should be learning a good deal of logic from basic algebra and geometry alone thats assuming they actually learned the concepts instead of just learned how to solved different versions of the same problem via memorization
LifeProTips,not_removed,what work was that
LifeProTips,not_removed,my favorite application for vectors although it doesnt use calculus the pandora or netflix algorithm my favorite multivariable calculus problem at any given point in the united states what is your average distance from a chinese restaurant
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont disagree with what youre saying about the importance of calc however the whole least mathiest of the maths thing is disappointing to me i am about to get my phd in statistics and my father is a math professor this kind of attitude from my father growing up is exactly what kept me from doing statistics until i took a class in undergrad and loved it very low level statistics calculate the mean median std plot a histogram is very different from high level math yes but so is low level math low level math plug and play formulas is very different from real or functional analysis linear algebra diff eq game theory prerequisites to my phd program was basically the requirements to get me a math major in undergrad the original response was correct the fundamental goal of statistics and mathematics are different low level statistics should be taught alongside low level math because it has more easily applied value in day to day life just like basic personal finance etc the way math is taught nowadays where its often just rote memorization do very little to actually teach people how to apply these abstract concepts to their day to day life which is the true issue the fact of the matter is statistics have come a long way in the last or so years it is far more rigorous and abstract today half of my professors work with mathematicians and are considered mathematicians in their own right however many mathematicians i think still think of it when it was in its infancy as some sort of bastard step applied child because to them applied is still a dirty word
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a physics grad who took abstract math classes for fun run away and dont look back but if you insist on turning your love of calculus and algebra into deep seated regret start with a class in real analysis its usually a foundational second year course for math majors
LifeProTips,not_removed,astronomy was great i was in a high school that was attached to a college and during our senior year we had to choose a course to take at the college i ended up taking astronomy because it sounded like a lot of fun and i love space well it was more math than anything else as you said im also a fan of math of course so i thought it was great of course a lot of my classmates were pretty upset to find that the course they thought was going to be an easy a required them to know how to balance an equation
LifeProTips,not_removed,why didnt he just start you guys off with excel it annoys the hell out of me that our school system insists on forcing people to calculate everything by hand when something like excel allows you to quickly solve thousands of equations in seconds you can play with the inputs and variables and see how the relationships work between formulas instead our school systems insist on forcing students to memorize complicated formulas something that you never need to do in professional life and pretend as if all the formula inputs are already given thats simply not true in practice knowing where the inputs come from why each input was selected and why the output behaves in such a manner and its significance is much more important than knowing the exact details of the formula
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you tell anyone maybe you did coin it
LifeProTips,not_removed,it depends though a lot the things that required good knowledge of calculus are now done with computers stats though even if its also often done with computers if you know nothing about stats you wont be able to do anything with the data
LifeProTips,not_removed,til lance armstrong is average
LifeProTips,not_removed,but he said means
LifeProTips,not_removed,actually both mean and median are kinds of averages and in this case both point to an average of one per person
LifeProTips,not_removed,but i dont consider myself as a mean person i consider myself as an average person
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont be a dickish pedant average clearly means mean unless specifically stated otherwise
LifeProTips,not_removed,mean can be misleading use median instead ok so median boob number
LifeProTips,not_removed,of course its beyond me to think is of a field of study that doesnt provide insights but since the math track for a nonmathscience student is usually an eitheror studying statistics makes far more sense for an informed life in general than calculus for those not in the sciences just as learning german will give you insights into life but if youre choosing one language to learn before your stay abroad in peru i have a different track to recommend
LifeProTips,not_removed,this but even more fundamental than that is simply understanding definitions i cant tell you how many people skimp on understanding definitions when i was a teaching assistant i would follow every little step a student made and base grading on that so many people make statements that violate the basic definition of a term
LifeProTips,not_removed,calculus while typically taught poorly is also a wonderful entrance into thinking maturely about mathematics i think the terrible teaching of introductory calculus is one of our worst problems in mathscience education almost nobody needs to memorize the integrals and derivatives to everything i frequently use concepts from calc or later in my work as a scientist and i probably wouldnt pass a lot of calc tests without a cheat sheet because they rely so much on memorization of things that are rarely needed and easy to look up three semesters of calculus concepts could easily be compressed into one semester by a good instructor if the focus were on learning how to use calculus and really understanding the meaning of the concepts teach students how to use mathematica or wolfram alpha or other symbolic math systems and let them use a calculator for all the memorization they were just going to forget a week after the finals anyway use the time saved to get them up to speed to the point where they can recognize when a multidimensional integral might be useful and know how to set it up probably of the applications i have for calculus are of things i learned in calc but theres really no reason they couldnt be in calc if the bullshit were stripped out of the whole sequence
LifeProTips,not_removed,the pvalue like a lot of things in frequentist inference is so unintuitive that it practically begs to be misinterpreted people misinterpret pvalues as the probability that the hypothesis is true because thats the probability they really wanted to know in the first place they couldnt give two shits about the probability of obtaining the result given that the hypothesis is false if you just httpsenwikipediaorgwikibayesianinference then you dont have to deal with the interpretational gymnastics of frequentist probabilities but i agree with you about calculus a lot of statistical problems are naturally formulated in terms of continuous distributions that have to be integrated
LifeProTips,not_removed,calculus is absolutely necessary for advanced statistics classes but it isnt necessary for the basic statistics classes i took ap stats my sophomore year of high school and ap calc my junior year not taking calc first in no way hindered my ability to learn the basics of stats later on at the university level a couple of my stats classes were essentially calc classes with how much crossdiscipline was necessary to facilitate the proofs but that said most people never get to the level of either math discipline to need the other
LifeProTips,not_removed,but you dont need calculus to understand basic statistics which is as this threads op implied is very useful to understand
LifeProTips,not_removed,after having completed a masters in science in something stats related you really really dont its only for incredibly difficult analysis that such background knowledge is helpful otherwise for average everyday use you dont need to understand calculus beyond probability is area under the curve edit not sure why everyone has this sort of need to try to one up i dont disagree with any of the comments below but if you read what i wrote it was what is applicable to the average every day use of statsof which frankly a cursoryintroductory understanding would be more than sufficient if your job requires anything more intense than the laypersons knowledge you would obviously need more than a basic understanding of calc
LifeProTips,not_removed,this means they didnt actually get statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,i definitely need my math to be heavily based in tangible things people taking a survey and the results of that survey as well as mathematical manipulations of the results are far more understandable to me than derivatives calculus is just too abstract for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,i really had a tough time with it until one day during a summer course when i accidentally went to class during the come down from some acid i had taken the previous weekend on that day statistics finally clicked for me ± would recommend
LifeProTips,not_removed,when ive spoken with the statistics department in the university they say that good statistician usually has a strong probability theory background after all probability is really the core of statistics and statistic inference
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hated doing anovas by hand our final test was a few multiple choice questions and one actual problem because of how long one anova problem takes solve
LifeProTips,not_removed,times you can blatantly forge data in this scenario
LifeProTips,not_removed,machine learning is really popular right now and it requires stats i agree that the other math classes are more useful though
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree discrete and linear algebra are useful— but my major had parallel tracks one calculuspdesmultiv and another track of probabilitystatisticsbayesian and i underestimated how much id need the stats
LifeProTips,not_removed,brb asking natalie portman out shes either going to say yes or no odds right
LifeProTips,not_removed,take a count of every situation where you can choose to use statistics or not and take to the power of that count for any situation its a in to the count of situation possibilty
LifeProTips,not_removed,given that im a cpa id say the probability is pretty close to accurate to within percentage points times out of
LifeProTips,not_removed,i mean technically yeah but in my day to day i have never had to deal with a resistor how many resistors are in your house
LifeProTips,not_removed,from what i hear reading the schaums outline on anything they go a long way helped me a bunch in my electrical engineering classes
LifeProTips,not_removed,scarcity is the better buzzword if you absolutely had to limit economics down to a single concept
LifeProTips,not_removed,am someone who is about to get into college to get an engineer degree can you guys decide
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the central limit theorem that states that as your sample increases the sample mean will converge in probability to an approximately normal distribution except for things like the poisson distribution i believe its what lets us use inferential statistics in the first place without nonparametric methods that speaks nothing on how large a sample is needed to have acceptable statistical power which is a measure of how likely you are to fail to reject the null hypothesis given it is false that is when you incorrectly conclude the alternative is true
LifeProTips,not_removed,many pople believe this but it is actually not true the size of the population is really not a good indicator of how big your sample should be the variability of your data is if average height in your state varies by about you need a smaller sample to get accurate stats compared to a state where height varies by cm lets suppose that after youre finnished with sampling your data every person is cloned and the population doubles your results from your sample will apply in the same way they did for the smaller population this is good news for a statistician who wants to create a national survey but bad news for a statistician who wants to make the same analysis about a city they both need the same sample size
LifeProTips,not_removed,pretty sure it depends on the effect size
LifeProTips,not_removed,keep talking im writing this down
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you know you can increase your odds of winning the lottery by buying a ticket
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not just an increase you will win
LifeProTips,not_removed,he can only give us a confidence level
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont be mean
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends on him being a frequentist or a bayesian guy
LifeProTips,not_removed,same here minor in statistics and to be honest the only reason i made a c instead of a d in regression analysis ii was because the professor was a smoking buddy cigarettes not pot yet and still i am glad i know what i know it is enough to know i dont know shit about statistics and i still know more than of people trying to quote studies and statistical analysis what i took from statistics people are liars and idiots
LifeProTips,not_removed,my guesses are statistical controls are often used in regressions so that the most obvious confounders eg income or education level for a socialscientific study are probably not making the correlation spurious observational studies arent taken as gospel by researchers just as something that suggests further research should be done this happens a lot in medical and nutrition studies where experimental studies will follow observational ones compelling theoretical work or previous empirical research might give us reason to believe with at least low or moderate confidence that a correlation is an example of causation there are some cases where people just use this line as a way to dismiss research its particularly frustrating when a study is done with a nice quasiexperimental design or uses an empirical technique thats much better than simple regressions such as httpsenwikipediaorgwikidifferenceindifferences
LifeProTips,not_removed,probably because many people use it as a way to deny evidence that strongly suggests a causal relationship like how eating more calories is correlated with weight gain you technically cant prove a causal effect even through ideal randomized controlled trials well you cant really prove anything that isnt mathematical
LifeProTips,not_removed,not the op but i think they were just saying that this is a oneliner than every student who has ever studied basic statistics will use it is still correct but doesnt exactly demonstrate an indepth understanding of the field
LifeProTips,not_removed,areas with alot of storks in germany have a higher birth rate that is a classical example why correlation doesnt imply causation
LifeProTips,not_removed,well if they say but correlation doesnt imply causation they would be incorrect because that is what correlation does it implies or suggests if they say but correlation doesnt equal causation then they would be correct also it comes down to perspective if someone is talking about implying causation on an aggregate level then sure that is reasonable but the aggregate implication generally isnt going to scale down to the individual elements or units very well it could if the sample has an extremely small set of variables to deal with but in that case you generally wouldnt bother with statistics my points is that there are two things going on here also a matter of perspective on the causation level
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you get a correlation there are four possibilities you have causation in the way you expect you have a causation in the opposite direction you have a third factor or combination of factors influencing both your first two factors coincidence is easy to weed out by repeating the same experiment andor increasing sample sizereliability of the samples can be minimised as a risk in some cases by carefully controlling for other variables but it is an issue to be aware of especially in cases where youre analysing data from the environment rather than conducting an experiment to collect data much of the time is a nonissue because its god damn obvious that faster windmills dont cause faster wind but it certainly is worth being aware of sometimes you may get both and being true in a positive feedback loop you could even get a combination of and if the system is complex enough part of the issue stems from the word imply in the phrase correlation does not imply causation mathematically implies has a very strict meaning if a is true then b must be true but not necessarily the other way around that means a implies b in common language implies means something very different it means if a is true then b is likely to be true and maybe the other way around in the mathematical sense the idiom is correct in the common language sense its frequently not
LifeProTips,not_removed,needs more anova
LifeProTips,not_removed,correlation does not necessarily imply causation but in statistics its not a black and white a correlation is not statistically useless just because it cannot imply causation people who dont really understand it tend to use the phrase to dismiss what they disagree with thats not how it works unless they are responding to someone that is specifically trying to imply causation based on a correlation
LifeProTips,not_removed,its true that correlation does not imply causation but nonscientists use this phrase without truly understanding the meaning behind it
LifeProTips,not_removed,not poster but would always look at the confidence interval or alpha level depending upon what used also the method of sampling is huge
LifeProTips,not_removed,p value power confidence intervals absolute vs relative risk and clinical vs statistical significance are a good start sample size matters much less than people often think power is much more important
LifeProTips,not_removed,sadly not all studies use the appropriate p value for one
LifeProTips,not_removed,and
LifeProTips,not_removed,stats isnt just about the numbers theyre just metrics that are helpful for interpreting results but the methods and results themselves are what matters thats really the challenge with stats its not a math issue most people can understand a students t test and moreorless what a pvalue means the tricky part is understanding when you need to correct for multiple comparisons whether a given significance level is really meaningful etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,you really going to trust a previously moronic veganantigmoproorganic teenager who learned how to analyze research studies with zero background in science but that one class taught me how or easy to find numbers in a page study like its one easy trick statisticians hate him
LifeProTips,not_removed,to be fair the study author with the phd has strong incentives to overstate their case more likely to get published can lead to lucrative book deals fame etc while the person who took stats may not be able to sort all studies into true or false categories but can catch a number of things that should indicate far greater skepticism
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would certainly never imply that im no longer moronic i think the big one is learning that after seeing the news headline milk causes cancer you should immediately look at the study theyre citing conclusion usually doesnt say causes sample size might be people etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,how many times a day do you say the word rhombus
LifeProTips,not_removed,so the only real life application of geometry is teaching others geometry confirmed geometry is the most tautological subset of mathematics edit s
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a fellow geometry teacher fuck geometry i teach stats too and its so much more interesting
LifeProTips,not_removed,a friend of a friend is a foreman in construction swore to me up and down that he doesnt use geometry wasnt sure how much i believed that though regardless geometry is an important basic
LifeProTips,not_removed,add surveyors carpet layers sailmakers painters paving contractors farmers and appraisers as people using geometry every day
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was alright with geometry but proofs were the bane of my existence i found calculus easy but couldnt grasp geometry proofs for whatever reason
LifeProTips,not_removed,and a value of zs
LifeProTips,not_removed,statatististically
LifeProTips,not_removed,you dont want to see me when im in a bad mode
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,are you sure it does not have a bunch of medianing
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpwwwtylervigencomspuriouscorrelations
LifeProTips,not_removed,you forgot to condition those probabilities to prior observations
LifeProTips,not_removed,those are the riskneutral probabilities
LifeProTips,not_removed,both are reassuring statistics i do t know how i would react going against a triplearmed tripletesticled man
LifeProTips,not_removed,the average human has one boob and one testicle
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think its pretty unlikely that the median person has one boob
LifeProTips,not_removed,but isnt the average person mean
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone with a math degree i disagree if you are a liberal arts major looking for one or two math classes then what you really want is something that teaches math logic math logic is similar to philosophical logic which has far more realworld application than basic statistics knowing numerically how statistics breaks down is great but when looking at the real world its not really the full picture since statistics are attempting to explain a single relationship of a far more complicated real world system if i produced statistical evidence that you are more likely to get stabbed going to an inner city high school than a rural one we could argue about whether or not the correlation implies causation and then the conversation would shift away from the statistics and towards other elements of the dynamic system that is living through high school wed have to talk about what variables are relevant to the system geographic economic racial relative violent crime rates in the larger area areas where logic is helpful and statistics is not the statistics would be a starting point but the actual meat of the conversation would be in logic i wish we taught math proofs and theoretical math earlier on but our culture has it relegated to honors courses for the most part at least until you get beyond calc but if you can find a calc class that does work with proving different formulas and theories things that do tend to be contained in most popular calculus books such as stewarts its a far more beneficial skill set to roll out into the adult world with than basic statistics statistics is just on a pedestal in places like this thread because its more often the place where idiots can be made to look idiotic edit another benefit of an understanding of math logic is that it makes it easy to learn new mathematical ideas on your own and be halfway decent at developing them on your own basic statistics are taught in grade school and combined with an understanding of math logic can be enough to recognize misused statistics in many cases and you can definitely pick up a book and muscle through it on your own but taking a stats class filled with memorization and regurgitation does nothing beyond prepare you to use those specific formulas which is just a terrible way to be prepared for the unknown future
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah but you said the calculus track makes no sense if youre not in a science you should modify your original statement to say something like having to choose between stat and calc
LifeProTips,not_removed,i believe this is the thinking behind modern elementary school math courses they focus less on the memorization of multiplication tables and such and more on the concepts of math itself this is difficult for parents because the parents were never taught how to understand those concepts in the same way parents know the shortcuts for solving division or multiplication but do they really understand what is going on behind the shortcut not really
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a calculus teacher at a private high school that wasnt bound to the ap class requirements ive taught it both ways the main concepts limits derivatives and integrals are really difficult concepts for students and having multiple ways to approach these problems actually does help them get this information i used to teach the relationship between those three concepts on the first day because other than integrals they are just slight extensions of precalculus concepts but it blew students minds and continued to blow students minds all the way through the class it wasnt until i could reinforce students understanding of those concepts by forcing them to use them to reason through problems in multiple different ways algebraic analysis tables graphs etc that they understood the material being forced to apply those concepts outside of easilylearned heuristics requires students to reconsider how those methods work and is a method of reteaching those concepts in other words think of those concepts from calc and like molds and the concepts in calculus as the actual concrete yes the formulas that you learned in those early classes werent important but they did help you as you worked your way toward understanding the material also if memorizing those formulas are all that the teacher teaches then that teacher is teaching it poorly but most calculus classes require all of those different ways of approaching problems so that you are supposed to keep relearning those concepts until you truly understand them and ill also add that i never truly understood calculus until i started teaching it
LifeProTips,not_removed,eh you should still have a calculus background anyways most high schools require calculus you also need linear algebra to best understand multivariate statistics most people who take statistics just memorize the formulas to forget them and use software to calculate everything
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly i dont mean everyone should know enough statistics to work for nate silver i mean everyone should know enough statistics to be able to see what makes stats significant or not so they can make more informed decisions on health politics financial risks etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who does statistics for a living i find this a bit terrifying i use insights from calculus every day in my work and even have had moments where all that measure theory stuff has provided a practical benefit calculus is the basic literacy of nearly all applied mathematics i will say that the manual derivation of integrals and derivatives is extremely rare in practice but knowing calculus is vital for example having an intuition about the relationship between the pdf cdf and quantile functions is very important and pretty much comes into practice every day if the fact that the cdf is just the antiderivative of the pdf is not immediately obvious youre going to have trouble with your analysis
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a class away from a stat minor and dont know much of anything about calc i probably should have taken it but i feel like i still have a solid grasp on stats
LifeProTips,not_removed,throw a ball in the air there is a function that you can use to determine its location the derivative of that function is the velocity of the ball the rate of change of position very tangible
LifeProTips,not_removed,calculus makes a lot more sense when the physics principles are taught first and calculus as a way to solve for physics problems
LifeProTips,not_removed,the derivative is less understandable than statistics quickly turns nonunderstandeable and abstract imo especially beyond stats
LifeProTips,not_removed,to reflects a lot of uncertainty i think you need to try this a few more times
LifeProTips,not_removed,currently on acid have had same feeling edit was not on acid at time
LifeProTips,not_removed,as an engineer of data i come across is already blatantly forged
LifeProTips,not_removed,business heads partied in college on wednesday mornings thats why
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought machine learning was based in linear algebra though
LifeProTips,not_removed,why not ask kiera knightly out at the same time then you have chances with a chance to get a yes of a date with one of them on saturday night but think it through carefully because using this method there is no chance that both of them saying yes and you are removing any chance of a threesome with both of them bring a condom and wear clean underwear youre welcome
LifeProTips,not_removed,whats the worst that can happen you get the thats a no go for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,im just screwing around i had to take engineering stats classes in school
LifeProTips,not_removed,love it when the r value is close to one
LifeProTips,not_removed,ill sell you the rest of my foolproof lottery beating plan for this is the secret lottery officials dont want you to know
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive got this bridge thatd be perfect for you friend
LifeProTips,not_removed,not by much though
LifeProTips,not_removed,buy two tickets and double your chances
LifeProTips,not_removed,im thinking its at a confidence interval but i could be wrong after all i only got a b in statistics
LifeProTips,not_removed,ex a study compares soda drinks and obesity the data shows obese people and drinking diet soda are correlated the conclusion is that drinking diet soda causes obesity if the truth is that people that are already obese people are more likely to drink soda then the conclusion is wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks for posting that wiki link very interesting reading anything youd recommend that takes a bit of a closer look that wiki while still not being overly technical
LifeProTips,not_removed,these reasons but also that although correlation on its own doesnt imply causation it is the first thing you check for if you do want to infer causation if two things are correlated that warrants further research even if you cant put much trust in the finding just yet it is a very important step in the way to finding evidence for causation so interesting for science but media jumping on each finding is a bit premature
LifeProTips,not_removed,which isnt telling the story because the effect of calorie intake on weight gain is much more then a correlation when we say correlation doesnt imply causation what we actually mean is that a correlation unlike an univariate analysis like an anova for example doesnt analyse effects or controls for other variables its just a description of a relation that doesnt mean that there arent statistical methods for proving a causation its just that correlation isnt one when doing an experimental study about calorie intake and the effect on weight gain you wouldnt analyse the results merely with a correlation because that doesnt tell you whats the independent and whats the dependent variable so the saying isnt wrong because everything is only ever a correlation its wrong because its applied to situations where it doesnt make sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,the statement that correlation doesnt imply causation is not correct really correlation does imply correlation to some extent it just doesnt prove it edit thanks for the additional responses ive learnt that the mathematical definition of imply is more strict than the dictionary one and therefore the statement that correlation doesnt imply causation can be considered correct depending on which definition youre using for imply
LifeProTips,not_removed,correlation correlates with causation
LifeProTips,not_removed,causation does not imply correlation not in a given sample a typical counterexample would be genetic illnesses such as phenylketonuria in which to suffer the disease you need both a the pku gene and b a diet containing phenylalanine almost everyones diet contains phenylalanine which is in most high protein foods and so a simple crosssectional study would show high correlation of phenylketonuria with the genes but not with diet however changing the diet is enough to stop people developing pku the diet is a necessary cause causal relationships are tricky things and whether they necessarily lead to correlation depends heavily on the sample used and the design of the study
LifeProTips,not_removed,also be wary of percentage increasedecrease smoking increase your risk of cancer by from people per to numbers all completely fabricated but you get the idea that cancer seems way worse than people per thousand
LifeProTips,not_removed,i suppose it depends on the type of measure being employed in the study whether its n or alpha etc which should be closely examined but thank you for the reminders methodology like random mall survey or mail in response can hugely affect selection bias youre right
LifeProTips,not_removed,method of sampling is by far the most egregious one i see in the media they report on magazine polls like they are meaningful no readers of people is not a worthwhile sample to tell you much worth reporting on
LifeProTips,not_removed,search for the p
LifeProTips,not_removed,indeed i think its actually been shown that a lot of academics dont really know statistics resulting in dodgy papers being published theres also the people who might get a p value of and then punch it repeatedly until its
LifeProTips,not_removed,goddamn this made me laugh much harder than it should have thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,generally this gets weeded out in the publication process referees in respected journls are insanely critical and will not advance a paper if they dont feel that it adresses criticism well or that it overstates the findings this varies by field though some disciplines have much more rigorous publication standards than others
LifeProTips,not_removed,well just because there are bad reasons to go vegan does not mean there arent good ones as well its very clear that a vegan diet has a smaller impact on the environment than a nonvegan diet people will try to use bullshit to push their opinions they could still be right about some of their life choices despite having bad reasons for them
LifeProTips,not_removed,you cannot infer causation from an observational study only an experimental but human experimentation is kinda hard to get by the irb highly correlated maybe but without a really big sample size the sampling bias could be enough to make it worthless
LifeProTips,not_removed,not enough data to meaningfully say that the username checks out

LifeProTips,not_removed,i used geometry to build plumb bob and a triangle works saved me a fortune in diy
LifeProTips,not_removed,hes using the principles and is just not aware of the fact that hes probably applying half assed geometry to his work you use geometry in so many tasks and skills but most of the time it consists of very simple measurements and getting shit even and straight which in many occasions dont even require maths
LifeProTips,not_removed,he totally does even if he doesnt know it he undoubtedly uses parallel line laws right triangle laws shortcuts for angle trig etc tell him if hes ever cut out or hammered together a perfect square hes doing geometry
LifeProTips,not_removed,proofs were the most fun i never had in a math class then again that was a discrete math course and once you learn that there are multiple types of infinity theres no way to top that and that was a college level course and that was required for a computer science major point isproofs are a special ring of hell

LifeProTips,not_removed,statatististicklee ftfy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hurt my tongue thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,after crunching the imaginary numbers im going to have to say that this is plausible at least
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hope you at least showed them the alt text
LifeProTips,not_removed,punch him in the testicles times the number of testicles times the pain
LifeProTips,not_removed,in an ordered set the median person is the middle data point assuming an odd count which this is not or the mean of the two middle values assuming an even count so with a sample size of two we calculate the median by finding the mean of the two middle values the mean of zero and two is one which translates to a median of zero and two being one
LifeProTips,not_removed,no the mean person is average
LifeProTips,not_removed,basic statistics are taught in grade school not for me they they werent us public school it was literally one chapter on the definitions of mean median mode and range this is why i find it to be such an important thing that is missing unless sought calc skills on the other hand which again are useful in their way and were certainly the track upon which all advanced math kids were put have yet to to become needed personally in my life at least in a recognizable form barring thinking skills etc with which it helps as i readily agree
LifeProTips,not_removed,im in agreement with more of the calculus stuff but elementary schools moving away from some of the more rote mathematics in favor of analysis is a big time problem kids need to know their multiplication tables they need to be comfortable with using fractions and stop relying on converting them to decimals these may seem relatively trivial when you have calculators but they make such an enormous difference in kids ability to do any kind of higherlevel math if a student is using workingcontextual memory to store temporary and procedural information as they move back and forth from a calculator it diminishes how effectively they can solve math problems that require those as small parts of those problems
LifeProTips,not_removed,there are also people who would say that cant really learn stats unless you know probability and you cant really learn probability unless you know measure theory i think there are things to be learned at each level eg no calculus here is the law of large numbers if you roll a dice a bunch of times and average the results you get calculus here is a proof for the weak law of large numbers theres also a strong law but fuck that shit its hard probabilitymeasure theory ok heres the proof for the strong law of large numbers
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol your extremely nice and rare highschool required calculus
LifeProTips,not_removed,and maybe recognize all of those clickbaity articles about health about policy etc for the bs they are at least i can hope right
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for saying this it wasnt until i got to graduatelevel classes that i really understood nine tenths of what i had really been doing in undergrad you can learn whats important and whats not and what procedures to use but frankly most of my sas output was gibberish to me as an undergrad working on projects and research without theory and without serious study of mathematical statistics youre basically just a programmer in my opinion

LifeProTips,not_removed,yep thats like when people say that people who eat breakfast every day lose more weight or are thinner on average or maybe those people are more health conscious in general and heard that eating breakfast every day makes you lose weight
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres a reasonably accessible textbook on regression analysis called mostly harmless econometrics by angrist and pischke it gets technical at times but you can skip over those parts while still getting the gist of the different analytical techniques theyre discussing its fairly heavily focused on designs like differenceindifferences that are more rigorous than simple comparisons
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes unfortunately its a book but every chapter is terrific theres a chapter on diffindiff its called
LifeProTips,not_removed,i mean theres correlation doesnt imply causation and i just want to think about any spurious variables that havent been controlled for to make sure were thinking about this right i mean theres just tearing people down and constructive doubt and a lot of people have a hard time seeing the difference
LifeProTips,not_removed,correlation does imply correlation well itd be hard to argue against that one
LifeProTips,not_removed,whether or not it is correct depends upon your definition of imply if we are having a formal logical discussion which is what we should be having in this context then it is true that correlation does not imply causation because in this sense imply is taken to mean what follows is logically necessary not possible not probable but strictly necessary for example i had exactly one banana for scale of course i just ate the banana and have not received any more from these two statements it is necessarily true that i now have no bananas the two ok strictly premises imply the conclusion there is however a more common and strictly inaccurate usage of the word imply which means something more like to suggest that on this meaning it is fair to say that correlation implies causation because finding a correlation via empirical study is a really good clue that you should take a closer look at that situation to see if causation can be found mathematical statistical or scientific discussions should take care in their use of language these are formal fields with strict methodologies and so the formal meaning of imply is the one that we should be using hence correlation does not imply causation edit i expect you already know all of this i just wanted to spell it out for people who might not
LifeProTips,not_removed,it doesnt imply causation in the boolean sense but most of statistics is about dealing with abductive reasoning where it does that universe is a caveat emporium though so statistics wont let you in
LifeProTips,not_removed,imply is a mathematical term with a strict definition if a implies b and you can demonstrate a then you have proven b conversely it means that a can never be true without b also being true therefore because not all correlation necessarily indicates causation you cannot say correlation implies causation not even in the cases where such causation does exist good statistical work can give you very high confidence that correlation indicates causation but it can never prove it for proof you need to show that a can never be true without b but yeah people misuse the phrase often to dismiss statistical results out of hand if youre disputing a highconfidence result you should probably bring a theory that does explain the correlation or explain why the two variables cannot be causally linked otherwise youre just being glib
LifeProTips,not_removed,but correlation is not the cause of causation
LifeProTips,not_removed,at the same time they could say something increased from people per to to make it seem like its the opposite to minimize the change observed
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just remember the study which said a piece of dark chocolate a day is healthy was done with participants tots legit sample

LifeProTips,not_removed,publication standards are also going to be different from journal to jounal and while a laymen might know the most famous journals in some disciplines having some way to judge a paper in a journal theyve never heard of is valuable putanumonitcom did a piece about where they suggest that when you read a study that says a causes b as measured by the tool of measuring b tomb you usually know more about b which is some variable of general interest and the accuracy of tomb than you know about a which is usually something the studys authors are experts on your skepticism should be based on these two questions how easy it is to move variable b and by how much is the sample size large enough to measure the effect with tomb you should not be asking yourself how likely was a to cause the effect as an example he gives this study which purports to find that of married women switch their voting preferences during ovulation hes skeptical because voting preferences tend to have almost no response to a wide range of other things and the implication that anything could cause million people change their voting preferences twice a month is pretty much unheard of as he puts it finding an effect that large doesnt mean that the experiment overstated a small effect it means that the experiment is complete garbage is basically as far away from as it is from effect in the opposite direction an effect thats times larger than any comparable intervention doesnt tell you anything except to ignore the study the original study was passed the publication process but if an undergrad looked at the numbers and said to himself yea to against this replicating it seems like theyd be completely in the right

LifeProTips,not_removed,statisticles the great greek warrior
LifeProTips,not_removed,just a heads up we dont call it statistics in grade school but we teach the basics side by side with probability going as far back as grade school in the united states or at least schools are supposed to i agree that knowing how to calculate a derivative or integral or find a limit serves little real world value unless you go into fields requiring that knowledge but working through mathematical proofs something that does happen in many not all calculus classes is a skillset i find more widely applicable to the real world than statistics without a logical background thats not to stay statistics is devoid of logic just that its not something that is generally covered in a math class that doesnt require calculus calculus with some theory is not too hard to find and imo far more valuable than an intro stats class
LifeProTips,not_removed,what i was saying is that you dont have to solve derivatives of cost functions by hand like you would in a calc class on an exam in practice most of the differentiationintegration is automated given that you know your loss function all of the standard loss functions have well known derivatives and if youre doing something custom you likely are using tools that automatically derive the gradient etc nearly every statistical software packages has tools for doing derivationintegration on a given function etc if you really need to get the analytical solution to a problem that nobody else has already solved then youll still likely use something like mathematica to make sure you get the correct results but in my experience reducing the need to mechanically perform calculus only magnifies the need to really understand it ive had people really struggle with simple optimization problems because the high level concepts of the gradient of a function confuse them even though they could very likely mechanically solve any undergrad calc problem i think one of the biggest failures in how we teach calculus is that many students who are able to mechanically compute an integral or derivative have no deep intuition about what these ideas mean to keep with my earlier example there are many people who can pass a calculus class who do not trivially see that the cumulative distribution function is the antiderivative of the probability density function
LifeProTips,not_removed,the good news is many of the most common probability distributions are mathematically simpler than the normal distribution so thats a plus and functions in the exponential family which includes the normal distribution are sort of wellbehaved in general

LifeProTips,not_removed,ehhh closest ill go is
LifeProTips,not_removed,they actually wrote thats geared toward undergrads and is even more accessible
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think theres two things here your logic is correct we can quibble over exactly what were willing to call a causal relationship and certainly my definition is not the same as yours id call each of a and b a cause as removing either would be sufficient to prevent pku however my comment was in response to causality implies correlation if i take your tight definition of causality thats potentially true in the abstract that said in the actual samples and data people hold there may not be sufficient information may not be sufficient variation in component causes to actually see that correlation even ignoring any confounding the existence of a causal relationship does not mean well see correlations in any given sample and in particular failing to find correlations does not necessarily provide evidence against a causal relationship
LifeProTips,not_removed,or graphs with bad axes for comparison
LifeProTips,not_removed,sure but the thing is its even it went from in to in from to out of is huge from to in thousands millions or billions is not the first is an increase from incidence to the second using is up to depending on what you want with the from samples to say you can pick between the number of cases has increased the incidence rate has climbed from to the chance of it happening rose the odds of it happening are now of what they used to be the chances of remaining cancer free have dropped from to for smokers
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha thats really funny id just tell myself that you should always reject the ho until your p is large enough then the ho fails to reject you that didnt make much sense i just liked saying ho out loud

LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah for example you could increase them more by rigging it or buying out the company
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are ignoring the implied part of the comment he is saying the the most you could ever increase them by through the purchase of a single ticket also the word you are looking is proportionately the first ticket you buy will give you proportionally a bigger increase in odds than any other ticket after not just relative to having nothing
LifeProTips,not_removed,not maybe before you buy it you have chance of winning youre infinitely more likely to win after you bought a ticket
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh nice ill keep that in mind as a introductory recommendation its nice to see an intro text that focuses on quasiexperimental designs especially iv
LifeProTips,not_removed,that said in the actual samples and data people hold there may not be sufficient information may not be sufficient variation in component causes to actually see that correlation even ignoring any confounding i apologize for not having enough width of sight to see that aspect
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hate this especially where they show a huge jump between two data points and you look at the axes and theyre like and where the difference in their data for this small amount isnt statistically significant
LifeProTips,not_removed,well technically floating point numbers as represented in a computer are countable they are in fact a subset of the rationals which are countable but yes the set of real numbers is uncountable and while you can say that there are two types of infinity countable and uncountable thats a very specific statement like saying there are two types of numbers and not the method we use to show that the cardinality of the reals is strictly greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers cantors diagonal argument is in fact showing that the cardinality of the powerset all possible subsets of a set is strictly greater than the cardinality of the original set thus we can see that the powerset of r is even bigger than r and the powerset of that is even bigger and we can repeat this process forever finding increasingly larger infinities these infinite are called httpsenwikipediaorgwikicardinalnumber now you might be wondering how many sizes of infinity there are very many too many to form a set actually
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats just mean
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry guys if i draw a venn diagram do i get the job
LifeProTips,not_removed,something tells me that if you can afford to buy the lottery company you probably dont need the money
LifeProTips,not_removed,isnt there a chance someone like hands you a ticket i dunno im reaching here
LifeProTips,not_removed,infinitely many times more likely but not infinitely more likely
LifeProTips,not_removed,for sure i was so happy when the book came out
LifeProTips,not_removed,considering buying the lottery company in america means buying the state government youre buying the ticket from
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not always about the money its about sending a message to all the hopeful ticketholders my evil empire aint gonna oppress itself after all
LifeProTips,not_removed,now youre looking at the chance of something else someone randomly handing you a ticket
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for saying this i have an unusual first name and often the first thing people ask me is if i have a nickname or if they can call me something else they just made up i find it so irritating and disrespectful its basically saying that im not important enough for them to try to learn my actual name
LifeProTips,not_removed,how often does this actually happen who just renames someone
LifeProTips,not_removed,nice to meet you adilemna what an unusal name can i call you lena
LifeProTips,not_removed,how do i add the flair i had no idea that was a thing but a bot just told me to
LifeProTips,not_removed,can i just call you dilemma
LifeProTips,not_removed,that seems pretty obvious to me unless specifically stated by the person i wouldnt presume to call them anything else usually i will specifically ask how to pronounce their name to make sure i get it right because i think its a bit insulting to use someones name improperly its like saying youre too lazy to learn it
LifeProTips,not_removed,good one udialman
LifeProTips,not_removed,same goes for people with more common names if i introduce myself a certain way thats what i want to be called
LifeProTips,not_removed,can we call you bruce just to keep things straight
LifeProTips,not_removed,say mind if i call you bruce hilarity ensues and afterward you can call them bruce without apologizing
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if you cant pronounce the name scared to butcher it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just call them fez
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly you dont even know me or care enough to learn my name but somehow you think you can rename me
LifeProTips,not_removed,it has happened to me a lot my name is michael and im a female and some people just cannot reconcile the two when someone asks for a nickname i say sure i prefer mike but they hate that even more
LifeProTips,not_removed,it happens enough that it gets a little old
LifeProTips,not_removed,it happens to me pretty much every time i introduce myself to someone new
LifeProTips,not_removed,next to the bar of words under the title there should be something that says flair its next to give gold report etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,brilliant
LifeProTips,not_removed,weve all been there i dont mind when people say it might take a couple of tries to get it correct that means they care to get it correct
LifeProTips,not_removed,same im a female with the name ryan and a guy was trying to hit on me asked me what my name was when i replied he said oh can i call you by a middle name what is it i replied elizabeth and no you may not he goes aw why not liz no ryan is my name before i thought about legally switching my first and middle name but after that i decided to just own it

LifeProTips,not_removed,bring matches and light one after you drop a load kills the odor
LifeProTips,not_removed,turn the ventilation fan on andor open the window
LifeProTips,not_removed,ventilation fans are generally designed to move humid air out and generally dont have as much effect on odors as people believe lighting matches is probably the most effective
LifeProTips,not_removed,tell them you have to run out to your car and then drop a load in the petunia bed theyll think it was the neighbors cat that did the deed

LifeProTips,not_removed,yea but what if my father is a lutheran pastor and tells me its a sin then im fucked
LifeProTips,not_removed,what the hell is wrong with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,here a life pro tip written by a year olf
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a great tip as soon as my kids got the hang of smile for the camera it turned into this weird expression they seem to think is a smile i usually have to catch them off guard
LifeProTips,not_removed,so i worked as a traveling yearbook photographer for a few seasons and the suggestions here for things like say boobies or chicken penis totally dont fly in schools lol professional phrases to get kids to smile girls princess pickle boys ninja monkey adult teachers margarita or paid vacation every single time teenagers fucking suck though you gotta bribe them with i need one solid photo of you with a nice smile and then we can take a fun one works most of the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a caricature artist when i need a kid to smile i ask them to say something gross like boogers poop fart theyll either laugh immediately or they get this impish smile which is even better
LifeProTips,not_removed,my daughter and i have an inside joke shes almost and her best friend is and a half and he cant say octagon he gets adorably upset whenever someone tells him to say octagon or if it comes up in a youtube song or whatever my daughter is very competitive so when we tell her to say it she gets this huge toothy grin because she knows she can say it and he cant yes toddlers are jerks so when i take her picture i tell her say octagon and shell yell and we end up with great smiles
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would like to see some of these photos there was a guy who was taking peoples photos around his school and when they asked what they were for he told them he was taking photos of beautiful things and then he took the photo and they were just awesome
LifeProTips,not_removed,or you could just say butts or poop as far as i can tell either one can be the punchline for any joke for anyone under
LifeProTips,not_removed,just yell everyone on three say chicken penis im serious twenty years later my dad can still get me and my siblings to crack a smile with that
LifeProTips,not_removed,my mom would always say everybody say shit then we would all giggle hysterically because we couldnt say it
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of my aunts always would tell us to say diarrhea right before she took the photo this was uproariously hilarious when my cousins and i were kids actually were all in our now thats still how she takes photos and its still hilarious
LifeProTips,not_removed,just tell them this is why you almost got put up for adoption cue great picture
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless your like me with crippling social anxiety and want to capture the moment of pure unfiltered anxiety
LifeProTips,not_removed,tells dad joke gets picture of child frowning and rolling their eyes
LifeProTips,not_removed,just use the old say cheese thing but replace cheese with a funny word that kids laugh at the adult version i usually use is say titties no adult can say that word and not have a big smile on their face
LifeProTips,not_removed,to this day i still cannot force myself to smile in a way that does not look unnatural
LifeProTips,not_removed,deep serious tone ive got one word thats gonna make you laugh underwear
LifeProTips,not_removed,so instead of fake cheesy smiles guess ill be getting groans and eye rolls
LifeProTips,not_removed,school photographer here if you can try talking incredibly fast when im rolling through the line during picture day ive somehow managed to end up talking at auctioneer speed without tripping over my words and turning into a wreck that alone usually gets the kids no matter what age smiling just repeating the phrases little more or little bigger will usually get the monster face wide eyes crinkled nose weird mouth to go away whether they are laughing at how ridiculous it is or whatever ill get a genuine smile the vast majority of the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,you sound like my grandma stop making that fuckin grimace ill include a yearbook pic when i wake up i say the darndest things when im sleepy
LifeProTips,not_removed,for little kids you can say show me your happy face
LifeProTips,not_removed,am i the only one who makes an ugly ass face when i laugh
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think i got my goto phrase from austen powers youve got a secret kids instantly respond with funny physical stuff
LifeProTips,not_removed,alternative i think i read this one on reddit a while back tell them now everyone say fart ive got one of the very best pictures of the grandkids using that one
LifeProTips,not_removed,my mum always used to say alright everyone ready for a photo everyone say shit one two three shit got us every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,another tip if you are doing a photo not a video get your kid to say ding ding ding ding ding it basically will force them to smile for a few seconds the dont laugh trick as mentioned above works great too
LifeProTips,not_removed,along the same line tell them to make a really silly face but they have to take a few seconds to think about it first thats when you usually get the really cute cheeky smiles
LifeProTips,not_removed,my dad would just say look at the birdie while flicking me off that always got me to laugh my ass off while styling a real smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who cant even manage a fake cheesy smile stop trying to force people to smile some of us are just incapable of it make us smile be a reason for me to smile for
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are in the picture with the kid tickle them a bit right at the last second works great on my year old
LifeProTips,not_removed,will definitely use this thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre trying to get an adult to smile for photo explain this tip to them
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is great advice my niece will have the loveliest smile on her face but as soon as i pull out the camera she clamps her teeth together pulls back her lips and stares with these dead serial killer eyes
LifeProTips,not_removed,my sweet sweet child looked me in the eye and said this twisted sick childhood that you have given me i wish you to rot in the nether with scathe and scorn for dooming me to this life of pain and anguish oh my sweet lil angel is quite the joker
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt learn to smile with your eyes and u can fk any b u want
LifeProTips,not_removed,my sisters youngest will only smile for picks if you make her say guacamole
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol im not a kid and if you day dont smile i know im going to like die of laughter it works for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,or make them say a word that contains a lot of i sounds like syphilis
LifeProTips,not_removed,it didnt work so well with my year old son and his mates when i shouted buttplugs i mean they all laughed except for my son
LifeProTips,not_removed,im fucking and dont know how to smile properly look like an idiot its like my face wasnt designed to smile as i just turn uglier eyes disappear nose gets bigger by everything is just wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,instead of cheese i tell people to say penis kids get a kick out of it and most parents do not guaranteed genuine smiles though
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah terrible tip most kids hate being put on the spot think about how you would react if someone told you tell me a joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,hmmm as a photographer this seems more of a photographer tip but i like it smiles are one of the most frustrating things to get right
LifeProTips,not_removed,glee was terrible
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was genuinely happy to have my picture taken as a child am i the only one
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a kid and this is not so good advice sorry
LifeProTips,not_removed,my grandmother would tell us to cuss okay everyone say sht worked every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a full on stand up comedian when i take photos of people i just have this ability to launch into my patter without thinking about it at all it works amazingly well for weddings especially if people are shy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree my father consistently scolded me for how i smiled in photos and it made me selfconscious about my smile to the point that i just stopped showing teeth in photos for years
LifeProTips,not_removed,actual legit lpt im part of history
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like to talk to people when i take their picture and oftentimes just saying some sort of stupid sht will get them go laugh in a natural way
LifeProTips,not_removed,but but i love my nephews cheesy smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude stop trying to tell us a joke with that wry look on your face whenever were trying to take a group selfie gawd kappa
LifeProTips,not_removed,my two almost three year old sister grabs my camera goes take a picture of me and makes the cheesiest smile ive ever seen but i still take them because man its so cute
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just like to say poooooooop have yet to not get a big smile out of a kid
LifeProTips,not_removed,mom would just say dinosaur poop would work everytime
LifeProTips,not_removed,i miss the times of glee
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone that absolutely hates posed fake smiley photos this is a great tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,im and have no idea how to smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds much better than my familys method of tickling me resulted in a lot of photos with a slightly pained but ultimately smiley look on my face
LifeProTips,not_removed,instead of say cheese say penis smiles all around
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just accept the fake cheesy smile its a fucking kid for fucks sake thats what their faces do
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats my stand up routine you think trying to be funny is hard try to be lame for minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,best photo my brother got of his kids is when his son farmed and stunk the room out hes the only one smiling in that photo
LifeProTips,not_removed,a simpler way is to say say dick instead of cheese
LifeProTips,not_removed,ask them to say poopy pants lots of giggles every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,whos he its that uncle who always asks us to tell a joke everytime he takes a picture
LifeProTips,not_removed,this sounds like a great way to photograph people in general lots of people are conscious when being photographed and it shows even if its more subtle than with kids im going to try this the next time i get a friend to pose for a portrait
LifeProTips,not_removed,or you could get idubbbz to help you
LifeProTips,not_removed,every situation has its joke cmon people
LifeProTips,not_removed,smiling children turn into frames from a television show that sounds scary
LifeProTips,not_removed,that trick wont work on me im getting out alive
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always say no smilling i said noo smiles snap
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just always give the kid the finger and they lalgh uncontrollably
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always tell my son stop thinking about farts immediate grin
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah and then they come with something they heard from their uncle and you drop the camera in shock runclejokes
LifeProTips,not_removed,nah say money perfect smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always tell my son to smile like when he sees our dog big genuine smile every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats fucking gay
LifeProTips,not_removed,typically the word fart or poo works for my kids
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you want a good smile in pictures just tell the person to not smile until just before you take it the smile fades take it while it hasnt
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont like glee that show pandered too much to the gay crowd for my liking
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive found that whatever you do do not smile does wonders
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to ask my kids to sing the alphabet if you time it right any vowel sound ending in an eeeee bcd e g p is a good spot to click also in general they will smile while they are singing it
LifeProTips,not_removed,wasnt this a neds declassified episode
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually tell the person dont fart right before taking the picture works for just about any age because farts are funny and also its safe to say around just about any environment
LifeProTips,not_removed,i blow a raspberry to take pics of my year old giggles every time hes so immature
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks ill remember this
LifeProTips,not_removed,say bubbles but say it angrily now stop smiling
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents took me to visit my cousin in america when i was or this was around the beginning of the nineties my cousin who was the same age showed me that if you hold up your hand in front of your face just at the right moment your face wouldnt be in the photo a good of the photos of me on that holiday were ruined cause you cant see my face and now i cant post cool thowback thursday photos on instagram
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am glad my job aint photographing families i made not smiling into a challenge whenever i got my picture taken as a kid
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a great tip going to try that
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a good one for when everybody say poop stops working on my year olds
LifeProTips,not_removed,can somebody tell me a grown up joke so that i can do this trick to make me smile when my picture is taken
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wish we had thought of this when my stepdaughter was small every photo we have of her as a little kid shes pulling an expression that she thought was smiling but that we affectionately referred to as the grimace
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel like this lpt should have posted some pictures as proof that it works but it sounds like a good idea
LifeProTips,not_removed,if they are too young to tell a joke you just tell them to laugh kids under usually will give you a nice laugh and it comes out great in pictures if they are being stubborn just tell them not to laugh and theyll usually end up laughing anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love taking pictures of my nieces and nephews but the oldest doesnt even give what you would call a cheesy smile she just knows that when you are taking her picture she should smile but she doesnt seemingly understand what to do with the rest of her bodyface so i always get pictures of her baring her teeth but looking soulless or possessed because there is no smile in her eyes and often her eyes are looking everywhere but at me ill definitely give this tip a try next time i see them any tips for multiple children though she has three younger siblings though one is still an infant getting all of them to actually look at me and smile for a family photo is nigh impossible
LifeProTips,not_removed,professional photographer here and you know what i say to your little tip yoink ill be using that thanks great lpt for a change
LifeProTips,not_removed,at first i read that as to avoid that fake cheesy smell on young kids had to double take
LifeProTips,not_removed,i tell my daughter to smile like she is having chocolate for dinner that usually works haha
LifeProTips,not_removed,to avoid fake pictures take them when the kids dont know you are taking them
LifeProTips,not_removed,proof of concept
LifeProTips,not_removed,will this work with my cat
LifeProTips,not_removed,bonus you get to hear jokes
LifeProTips,not_removed,reminds me of that episode on modern family
LifeProTips,not_removed,the photographer guycompany my school district hired for all photos would crack jokes at us and call us funny celebrity nicknames to get us to laugh same guy took my school photos i did my sr pics and called me cindy crawford most of those times lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,for adults i have a friend that usually says saaay sluts never fails
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a related story the daughter of a tutor i had had been selected for an anti smoking shoot she was about to years old it was an australian ad with the little girl blowing out blue smoke fyi as it often is with kids that age you tell em to do something they decide theyll do the opposite she had to open her mouth for the photo and just wouldnt do it the photographer got a tv on set and put on playschool for all you and aussies our there then he set it to mute just as she opened her mouth to protest he took the photo worked like a charm
LifeProTips,not_removed,great idea my favorite technique was from a male and female photography duo from high school totally caught me off guard when the girl said to imagine the guy in a bikini and he pretended to flip his hair behind his shoulder
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always yell dont laugh stop laughing at my year old when hes trying to give me an awful tightlipped fake smile makes him giggle every time my year old says cheese and makes this weird face but it cracks me up right now so i let it go i prefer candids anyways so its rare for me to make people pose i also take awful pictures so if someone takes a picture of me i make a goofy face on purpose because im going to look awful on my own terms 😂
LifeProTips,not_removed,the aristocrats photographer drops camera
LifeProTips,not_removed,real lpt tell them to smile right before the photo when you have to hold a smile your face starts to relax giving the weird forced smile smiling an instant before you take a picture resulted in a much more genuine smile around your eyes
LifeProTips,not_removed,im an adult and i need this i cant smile on command worth a shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,every single picture will consist of minutes of so this one time thisso thisthis one time theredaddaddad listena dragonthere was a dragon and he didnt like my brother my dragon hates you yelled the brother
LifeProTips,not_removed,congrats for reaching ralltop of the day top with your post nbsp i am a bot probably quite annoying i mean no harm though message me to add your account or subreddit to my blacklist
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just have them say stinky feet works every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,i typically ask them to say hahaha it works for the most part and they start giggling
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually go ok say pee
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just put some clear tape attached to the mouth
LifeProTips,not_removed,my year old cant quote anything from aladdin without cracking up like crazy im going to use this next time i ask him to take a picture
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am part of a group that visits ambassadors at the un and we take a picture with each one the person who takes the picture is always the person with the worst accent and they always get the best picture because by the time they get everyone in the shot everyone is dying laughing at the accent you have to realize this is at the un so almost nobody can speak english but it doesnt stop the smiles so lesson learned i always mispronounce something whenever there is a picture about to be snapped
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually tell my kids fart jokes to get a real smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,useless on my bad op bad is the s really necessary
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wonder how long thisll work until they figure it out
LifeProTips,not_removed,i learned my favorite jew jokes this way kids say the darndest things thanks lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,definitely going to use this my girlfriends kid thinks smile means show us all the teeth in your head
LifeProTips,not_removed,a friends daughter needs this cute kid but her on demand smile makes her look like the antichrist
LifeProTips,not_removed,this was uproariously hilarious when my cousins and i need this i cant smile on her face but as an added bonus you should make the joke bathroom related
LifeProTips,not_removed,just mention poop everybody laughs at poop jokes
LifeProTips,not_removed,im going to try this on myself
LifeProTips,not_removed,heard saying mocha helps too
LifeProTips,not_removed,i want some photos attempting this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just tell them jokes or screw around while taking the pic but i never let them know im actually ready to take it your way seems like less effort and will be my go to trick
LifeProTips,not_removed,or you could say poop or fart i mean what kid wouldnt smile after saying that
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i was in kindergarten i went to get a picture taken and i was wearing this scratchy red mickey mouse shirt that drove me crazy the photography said picklehead which started to make me laugh because of its lack of context but in trying to stifle my laugh i ended up making this scrunched up butthole mouth smile i always hated that picture and ill never forgive that dude
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love the idea of asking a photo subject to tell a joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to have my kid say farts are funny and it worked pretty well
LifeProTips,not_removed,my son all of a sudden has the fake cheesiest smile he looks like a total goof because its not natural i told him to close his lips and barely smile and he comes out looking fairly decent
LifeProTips,not_removed,say bubbles but say it and he cant
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok mommy um oh i got one so these two hookers walk into a bar
LifeProTips,not_removed,another pro tip do not ask someone to smile at the camera until you are good and ready to take the picture forcing a subject to hold a smile for longer than about seconds will inevitably make your picture look artificial and bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,i ask my daughter to roar and get some great pictures
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have three sons two teens and a preteen i just say something like hairy balls and they start laughing my pictures are great my parenting probably not so much
LifeProTips,not_removed,m bodies in the saaaaand m
LifeProTips,not_removed,jokes that make fun of yourself are far better than jokes that make fun of otherso make fun of yourself while others take their picture
LifeProTips,not_removed,that or that modulated pretty sure that is foolproof if you listen long enough especially coupled with the challenge of deliberately not trying to smile like you mentioned
LifeProTips,not_removed,genuine happiness always works
LifeProTips,not_removed,accidental interrogative mark
LifeProTips,not_removed,i remember one time in junior high i was in a mood and was determined to not smile for my picture the photographer just looked at me serious and said money in a monsterish voice best way to describe it when i got the photo back my mom was really happy how natural my smile was and how happy i looked i was actually very pissed in that moment because he got me to smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always tell the kids dont smile dont smile why are you smiling and they cant help but giggle and smile wonderful pics that way
LifeProTips,not_removed,it looks something like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,im and i still do thishelp
LifeProTips,not_removed,grown ups do that too the failure is just a little bit more subtle
LifeProTips,not_removed,like

LifeProTips,not_removed,julie andrews suggested to colbert on the late show to always say money when taking a picture
LifeProTips,not_removed,i laughed at princess pickle lol does that mean im a girl
LifeProTips,not_removed,poop fart
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a grown as adult but if a photographer said poop fart id probably laugh
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think of myself as reasonably intelligent i just realized that the cheese cue is designed to get a picture of your mouth in a smile i really didnt have a clue why that word was used never questioned it i may be retarded
LifeProTips,not_removed,say fuzzy pickles
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol yep toddlers are jerks

LifeProTips,not_removed,it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good mojo must be in want of a shag
LifeProTips,not_removed,school photographers always forced me to contort my face uncomfortably because they did the exact opposite of making me want to smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,whats up with the need to smile for photos anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did that to my friend at elementary school his convulsions were printed on photopaper for future references
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is what the creepy awkward uncle does
LifeProTips,not_removed,shhhh
LifeProTips,not_removed,he knows buttplugs are serious business
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think that was ops point just make them laugh
LifeProTips,not_removed,this can backfire pretty easily the photographer at my school one year tried using pickles instead of cheese and now theres a picture of me looking confused in a yearbook somewhere
LifeProTips,not_removed,julie andrews spoke of this trick when she was on the late show with colbert a few weeks ago she said it was something about the way your jaw drops and lower your chin that makes the smile more authentic
LifeProTips,not_removed,the weirdest thing is that people could point the camera at me and tell me the funniest joke but as long as i can still see the camera my face is frozen into a fake smile and its hopeless if the camera werent there when they told the joke id be laughing hard theres only one setting in which id appreciate having that camera and thats the military you know how they deliberately tell jokes to make you laugh when you are supposed to be super serious and pokerfaced id done so much better if there were a camera
LifeProTips,not_removed,deleted
LifeProTips,not_removed,at my graduation photos the photographer said something to me that sounded really weird and freaked me out it shows on the photograph he ruined the photograph
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i was a little kid my great uncle used to freak out my parents a little because whenever he wanted me to smile for a picture hed break out the big guns okay say monkey shit i was always simultaneously too terrified and too hysterical to actually say it though
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha this post made me laugh so much i dont remember whether it was my third grade photographer who made a joke or a friend who did something silly while i was getting my photo taken but my yearbook pic looked like
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant help but read that as sergeant hartman you will not laugh you will not cry
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a way better photo than a genuine smile though looks hilarious
LifeProTips,not_removed,why do kids not know how to smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,and my c what

LifeProTips,not_removed,must be just an american joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry dumb question paid vacations means getting the entire vacation paid for like hotels and flights or basically still getting paid a salary when on vacation
LifeProTips,not_removed,most full time jobs will give you a pool of paid days off these days can be used for vacation or sick days
LifeProTips,not_removed,very rarely lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,we blow our own minds
LifeProTips,not_removed,finally got a job interview at a dollar store chain on a monday the manager asked me to come in on wednesday and i told her i would be going to the hospital to have labor induced that day how about friday okay so i ended up being minutes late to the friday interview because i didnt leave the hospital with my newborn daughter until and really needed a shower i started work the following tuesday

LifeProTips,not_removed,american worker here i get at least weeks paid vacation a year and thats not including paid holidays yes i am salaried plus i get free health insurance with no deductable low federal income tax and a car allowance
LifeProTips,not_removed,two years of paid maternity or paternity leave would be amazing my husband actually had to return to work while our twin boys were still in the nicu he would leave our home at am so that he could stop by the hospital to see them for a few minutes before work each day the drive added another hour to his hour commute treasure that extra time with your families
LifeProTips,not_removed,the pay we get in the summer is cut off from what we should received in the rest of the year

LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,get people to say fromage and youll get some hilarious pictures of them pulling a weird face while saying it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just realized when i read your comment so theres that
LifeProTips,not_removed,as long as you know that men also put down the lid when sitting it could be worse
LifeProTips,not_removed,ohhhh christ i always thought it was so you knew to keep your eyes open while you were saying cheese as they would take the photo in that time and you can blink after need to re evaluate my comprehension skills
LifeProTips,not_removed,i spent several years thinking volleyball was balleyball
LifeProTips,not_removed,for years i thought it was to make you think of cheese i mean cheese is a nice tasty thought right until someone explained
LifeProTips,not_removed,pretty often if youre a toddler and like listening to songs about shapes
LifeProTips,not_removed,hot line bling gangnam style what does the fox say etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,why not not a sarcastic question i would like to know what the dangers are
LifeProTips,not_removed,well i think it poses more of a risk if you post pictures of your children that relate itself to personal information such as location daily schedules interests etc edit the picture is out of focus the focus is on the childs upper shirt rather than her face
LifeProTips,not_removed,someone tell rdaddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i see people always posting pictures of like kids they babysit on social media like wtf i want to tell the parents
LifeProTips,not_removed,explain why
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is exactly what i came for duuuude
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is surprisingly touching but what was with the girl in the middle of the video she wasnt having it strange made me a bit sad for her
LifeProTips,not_removed,why does everybody look like they attend drama class or are in an art school
LifeProTips,not_removed,everyones the most beautiful person in the world the moment they smile
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck i wish that girl wouldve used a tripod i really want to download and stabilize that video now as its really nice shot otherwise also a beautiful idea and great video
LifeProTips,not_removed,still works on my mum at
LifeProTips,not_removed,im almost i realized one day while watching some tv that i almost always laugh out loud at poop jokes its not the only thing i laugh that hard at but its probably the only thing that never fails especially a joke about someone shitting their pants gets me every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,still works for my sis at
LifeProTips,not_removed,so
LifeProTips,not_removed,means absolutely nothing youre obviously not australian
LifeProTips,not_removed,you dont sound like you were gonna smile anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,no hen is the female chicken is the species also ducks have penises so theres also that
LifeProTips,not_removed,chickens are absolutely not the female although most chickens we eat are female or hens as male chickens or cocks have tough meat
LifeProTips,not_removed,chicken is the common name hen is the word for female also some many waterfowl are what spring to mind birds do have penises theyre just not external
LifeProTips,not_removed,a cloaca will still get me to laugh every time as my high school zoology teacher told us that the latin words scientists based the word cloaca off of translate to dirty hole thats a name i would expect of me but never of actual mature adult scientists
LifeProTips,not_removed,chicken isnt the female its the generic term for the species hen is the generic term for a female chicken and cock for a mature male you are correct in that chickens do not have palluses but instead have cloaceas that engorge with lymph just prior to mating
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats what made it so funny
LifeProTips,not_removed,nothing warms the spirit like shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats because he didnt use the word titties
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah but who can really smile when they are fearing for their life
LifeProTips,not_removed,say ottoman empire
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh behave
LifeProTips,not_removed,im about to take a school photograph killmenow
LifeProTips,not_removed,ready say fuzzy pickles
LifeProTips,not_removed,my school photographer did the same thing one year she told my younger sister say pickles for me and my sister excitedly repeated pickles for me she loved pickles so she was smiling really big in the photo
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had a professor once that would yell sex when we take group pictures the class was immature enough to laugh every damn time
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah weve got a family photo where i look like i just farted because im half frowning half grimacing at a shitty joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,the photographer at my elementary school used to always say stinky socks to get all the children to laugh it worked the first time we heard it after that it just got old
LifeProTips,not_removed,once a photographer yelled bikinis at me and now there are very professional pictures of me looking distressed albeit welldressed
LifeProTips,not_removed,i learned from psychology that its the way your cheek rises and your eye squinting that makes it look more natural
LifeProTips,not_removed,i laughed reading this
LifeProTips,not_removed,say cheese pizza
LifeProTips,not_removed,i got really disappointed when i clicked the link cuz i was hoping it was the real yearbook photo

LifeProTips,not_removed,uhoh youve summoned the swedes
LifeProTips,not_removed,feelsfuckingbadman
LifeProTips,not_removed,getting paid your salary while on vacation
LifeProTips,not_removed,its the latter though for teachers the emphasis is more on the vacation part my wife and sister are both teachers and they hardly ever get a break downtime means lesson planning grading data entry writing ieps or maybe sleep
LifeProTips,not_removed,salary lel
LifeProTips,not_removed,still getting a salary even when not present at work
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is outrageous sorry it is a working person should have access to paid vacation time and paid sick days i though this was basic stuff at least in the first world
LifeProTips,not_removed,these days can be used for vacation or sick days what the actual fuck are you telling me youll lose vacation days if you get a cold and have to stay home
LifeProTips,not_removed,because while working two jobs you couldnt afford to have your mind blown
LifeProTips,not_removed,whaaaat you start working right after giving birth but you need to rest your body needs to heal wtf
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow thats a really good place to work at
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow i hope your boys are okay now
LifeProTips,not_removed,teachers but i have heard that the rights of workers arent really well represented over there im sorry edit i mean workers in general
LifeProTips,not_removed,asterisks would be better than quotes there
LifeProTips,not_removed,youll work longer than the guy that says show boobies
LifeProTips,not_removed,y
LifeProTips,not_removed,what exactly is a poop fart

LifeProTips,not_removed,or perhaps when she gets older jack black ytps
LifeProTips,not_removed,bruh all those mma highlight reels
LifeProTips,not_removed,someone will backtrace your ip and download your kids through the photos
LifeProTips,not_removed,real danger to the kid most probably close to zero but with your kid you usually post pictures of your furniture car tv set mancave setup security system etc in the background so youre putting many of your valuables to show to anyone who might be interested a potential burglar just needs to check when youre not at home and of course imagine someone jerking off to your kids photo its better to not give anyone any of those options you can still send photos in private messages to friends and family
LifeProTips,not_removed,when the kid is older she maybe doesnt want her kidbaby pictures on the internet
LifeProTips,not_removed,same dangers of flashing money makes you a target for people interested in money
LifeProTips,not_removed,shes insecure and thought she was being made fun of
LifeProTips,not_removed,also the girl at made me feel like someone could tell her all day shes beautiful and she still wouldnt believe it i hope she does believe it now
LifeProTips,not_removed,she was one of the people who knew her clearly
LifeProTips,not_removed,well one person was wearing a shirt for chicago high school of performing arts so probably are in art school
LifeProTips,not_removed,your mom was a jerk
LifeProTips,not_removed,does she shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude put a nsfl tag on that
LifeProTips,not_removed,helicopters dont flap
LifeProTips,not_removed,accurate i have high functioning autism emoting is for scrubs
LifeProTips,not_removed,most waterfowl have a phallus due to their environment and the difficulties that introduces to a cloacal kiss
LifeProTips,not_removed,as male chickens or cocks have tough meat yeah cocks are way too hard to eat
LifeProTips,not_removed,broilers are harvested at a young age and are both male and female unless youre talking non commercial birds then yea source am commercial chicken nerd
LifeProTips,not_removed,rather than a penis male chickens have like most birds a cloaca a multipurpose orifice used for urinating defecating and mating which is generally performed using a cloacal kiss in which the male and female of a species will touch these orifices together long enough for the male to transfer sperm
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone into biology as a hobby i know it was a poor attempt at a joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,as you wish shoots
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuzzy pickles do not taste
LifeProTips,not_removed,he always caught me at the worst time when basically all of my characters but ness were hiding behind stuff

LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought this was just mr sonny my life is a lie
LifeProTips,not_removed,so cute tho
LifeProTips,not_removed,my mom still does this and were still all immature enough that everyone smiles
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can never be mature enough not to laugh at sex
LifeProTips,not_removed,the best part of this is the fact that she worked in a diner get your own pickles
LifeProTips,not_removed,shes like a cat
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hate them mainly due to the smell
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think this is more correct no squinting makes it just look like youre showing off your teeth no matter the face angle no squinting and you cant even see their jawchin position but it looks natural and happy
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats ms chanandler bong to you
LifeProTips,not_removed,damn u beat me to it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i laughed reading this
LifeProTips,not_removed,who said that who the fuck said that

LifeProTips,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilistofburncentersintheunitedstates i got you something to help
LifeProTips,not_removed,but isnt that normal italian here working in a private company with a national contract
LifeProTips,not_removed,you mean teachers are not given paid leave do they not have school holidays and teachers as well get the holidays while still being paid sorry slightly confused with the system you have in america
LifeProTips,not_removed,uh what teachers get more time off than any other profession they get an entire winter break and the entire summer vacation along with every public holiday and yeah they might lesson plan or grade but most people dont just work and then come home and rest working after hours is a norm across most professions
LifeProTips,not_removed,i though this was basic stuff at least in the first world it is basic stuff in the first world hopefully the us will catch up to the rest of the first world one day
LifeProTips,not_removed,to be honest ive worked jobs from construction to desk jobs in the northern and southern us and have always had a separate set of sick days and pto paid time off days its not legally mandated though so i guess its not common everywhere
LifeProTips,not_removed,it absolutely is i had my first kid september of last year i had to use most of my paid time off to help my wife for the first couple weeks my company refills your pto days on your hire date so i dont get any more pto days until may the way american companies are able to treat their employees sickens me
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work in the us and my job gives me paid vacation and sick days and lumps them into one paid time off pto pool you can use them as you want if you dont get sick alot you just get to use them towards more vacation that way nonsickly people dont feel cheated or have to play sick
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes
LifeProTips,not_removed,trust me i really ran myself into the ground especially with my lupus but i feel so useless when i dont have a job after running myself into the ground for a few months while taking care of a newborn working and going out with friends periodically i was losing it so when my grandfather got sick and then died after a few weeks when my daughter was months old i didnt take it well at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks they are intelligent healthy beautiful twoyearolds now
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess it depends i have insurance theres a doctor right in my building i can go see any time my mom has insurance too she works a manual labor job and at the same time ive read from friends in the uk their issues with the public healthcare there having to jump through hoops having to deal with public services overcrowded clinics limited hours etc so you have public healthcare but how good is it you also look at the teeth of some of the people abroad and you maybe realize one reason healthcare here is expensive its actually good people come in from abroad to the us to get care here and it costs money to be at the forefront of it to develop new technologies versus simply getting the technology once its older and cheaper and that isnt to say there arent problems anywhere you have money involved youll have sharks trying to get it for themselves

LifeProTips,not_removed,cops and teachers both the bar and paylevel are set too low
LifeProTips,not_removed,its the same in the uk recent stats say that roughly of all new teachers leave in the first years ive worked as support staff in the education sector for or years and the amount of people who leave education with no job to go to is staggering
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dunno if its only american but im not american and i found the premise of this joke preposterous where i am from summer holidays arent a vacation for teachers theyre expected to brush up on their skills as a teacher and on the field they teach and to prepare a lesson plan for next year they get two or three weeks of paid vacation per year just like everyone else
LifeProTips,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofburncentersintheunitedstates helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
LifeProTips,not_removed,its normal in the eu
LifeProTips,not_removed,technically yes but a lot of a teachers duties are expected to be done on their own time basically any kind of work that doesnt involve being in the classroom the american school system is far from universal things like creating and planning lessons for the whole school year are usually the responsibilities of individual teachers for their own classes even textbooks are created by competing third party companies rather than any level of the government or school system its not unusual for students to be using decade old textbooks schools get their funding through school districts which usually only fund a handful of schools the state basically gives school districts money and says teach some kids to pass these standardized tests and gives no fucks how they do it theres no real federal or state rubric on how classes should be conducted if youre lucky youll find some schools and school districts run by passionate people that have built a good system that can set up students for true success but there a still a ton of horribly managed schools all over the country its a really bad system
LifeProTips,not_removed,even in slovakia and i believe most of postsoviet part of europe the teachers do not have holidays of course they get free days during the public holidays which are days usually celebrating some historical or religious dates xmas easter end of all saints day but if school holidays fall on regular working days the teachers are expected to come to school and do administrative tasks for example this winter the school holidays were between that means if a teacher wanted to spend time with their family they had to take days of vacation public holidays were december and january rest was weekends or standard working days so yes teachers get paid leave but usually can take it only during school holidays since most schools would only employ enough teachers to get by if one or two get ill vacations are not planned for
LifeProTips,not_removed,true there is more total time off and i agree it is nice to have when i did work as a teacher with classes per day and students i usually worked on a good day and around any periods of reporting parentsteacher days science fair etc i could be at school until i also often worked through lunch it was usual to bring work home and mark assignments even with these hours it wasnt because i was inefficient or lazy there was always so much work piled on so many students who needed extra help minimum hour days plus hours done at home salaried over holidays we still often needed to make lesson plans write letters of recommendation mark papers it was exhausting and the burn out is real i was already lucky because i taught at a private school and had a max class size of edit to add most of these hours are people facing so there isnt much of a time to have a slow day at work if you do it means youre not teaching were almost constantly orating
LifeProTips,not_removed,most people dont just work and then come home and rest working after hours is a norm across most professions i mean this level of unpaid work from employees being illegal is a norm across most world countries is worklife balance a foreign concept in your country
LifeProTips,not_removed,teachers get more time off than any other profession they get an entire winter break and the entire summer vacation along with every public holiday you are not a teacher and do not know any teacher well enough am i right in what universe do teachers get more time off than any other person do something good for your community go to your local public school and talk with the teachers get to know them and see what and how much they work please
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha tell that to my mom who spent every night and weekend grading classwork doing report cards and creating lesson plans and all sorts of other bullshit not to mention all the training she was required to take in the summer you sound like someone whos never talked to a teacher outside of school and your last bit about every profession taking their work home with them after hours is complete and utter bull and you know it most people arent working until every day unpaid
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe where youre from but not in australia here most teachers work at school and then go home to do more at night and on weekends not to mention the fact that we only get paid for five of those hours then on holidays we are expected to be preparing work for the next term we may seem to get plenty of time off but its far from the truth mate git farked
LifeProTips,not_removed,unlikely to happen for at least the next years
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats mental because in the uk not only do i get paid sick days up to two weeks without a doctors note can be more with one sick pay is not full pay mind and then for example this year i have days holiday to use at full pay and then the bank holidays and the christmas week at full pay then if i did have a baby id get paid mat leave is it months at full then decreasing and men can have weeks pat leave at full pay
LifeProTips,not_removed,fucking hell you shouldnt have to chose between getting over a cold and getting a vacation thats not how you get efficient workers
LifeProTips,not_removed,im sorry you had to go through that i hope it will get better
LifeProTips,not_removed,a lot of public healthcare works fine but sometimes it doesnt and goes spectacularly wrong which are the ones that get mentioned a lot most of the time it is boringly uneventful eg i felt generally under the weather for a few weeks so decided to see a doctor phoned one morning had an appointment for later that morning scheduled for blood tests days later which was also when it was next convenient for me tested for about different things the results came up on my online account over the next days the last one to appear was outside normal ranges so i phoned the doctors to ask more and the doctor had left a note on my account with treatment options i selected one it needed a prescription that i picked up after work that day £ total cost no time needed off work
LifeProTips,not_removed,i couldnt agree more with your last sentence no system is perfect and i love that we can learn from each other the main point is that people who need help should get it indifferent from their social and financial status
LifeProTips,not_removed,agree to disagree
LifeProTips,not_removed,y
LifeProTips,not_removed,hell yeah i would
LifeProTips,not_removed,you dont know me

LifeProTips,not_removed,how long have you been sitting on this card lmao
LifeProTips,not_removed,yo get the updoots
LifeProTips,not_removed,a teacher in california can not in any way support themselves on their shit salary and on top of that their jobs are threatened to be cancelled almost every single year but learn to swing a bat toss a ball into a hole or throw a football better than anyone else and youre a millionaire makes sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,they get two or three weeks of paid vacation per year just like everyone else ouch weeks paid per year is the legal minimum for a full time employee of any industry in sweden
LifeProTips,not_removed,two or three weeks ha ha ha canimovetoyourcountry
LifeProTips,not_removed,in the states youre lucky to get a few days of paid vacation two weeks paid vacation is about the highest i ever see it get and thats for the really nice jobs
LifeProTips,not_removed,in america teachers have to do a certain amount of continuing education within a certain time period but most teachers have to do that around a summer job because teachers arent payed anywhere near enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,the joke is that they dont get paid vacations and so the idea of it would make them smile its an american joke because other countrys have better working conditions which usually include paid leave not implying that they do get paid vacations
LifeProTips,not_removed,teachers dont get paid for the summer unless they work the best option they have is that they can stretch out their current pay for another week or two but they dont get paid throughout the summer not only that teachers dont get paid well period here edit teachers still need to go brush up on their skills and frequently receive training lessons plans can stay the same for the most part as long as the textbook and requirements by state dont change the bump in the road is when you have english as a second language students that need catered plans
LifeProTips,not_removed,its normal in the first world
LifeProTips,not_removed,ooo thanks for the explanation i understand now i can imagine your system getting worse with the pro charter head of education sounds like its designed to sap away money from the system which ultimately affect the poorer schools i cant imagine the increased work load these teachers will face with diminishing budget
LifeProTips,not_removed,decade old when i was in grade in the kids in the pictures of my text books were wearing clothing confirmed when i went to the publishing page and saw the copyright year i wonder what the school district was doing with the dollars in taxes everyone has to pay every year and it gets approved to be raised each year if it doesnt approve they threaten to cut out all of the sports teams and have a revote and it passes
LifeProTips,not_removed,you just explained that perfectly it really is awful something has to change the teachers are stressed the kids are unhappy and the parents are confused everytime i go to check work all i can think is that their feeding my kid disinformation
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds a lot like every other job in america unless youre working the register at mcdonalds youre responsible for your tasks being completed on time also its called a summer break and i believe it lasts more than two weeks atleast for the teacher i use to date editreceived two work related emails while typing this up
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre an hourly employee and the company isnt paying you for the overtime or paying you less than minimum wage then its illegal as a salaried employee im expected to do what it takes to finish projects on time and support who i need to support if that takes more than just my hours tough shit im working at night
LifeProTips,not_removed,in america somewhat we arent expected to work hours a week and never sleep but most people put in well beyond their hours a week especially in corporate environments i work for a multinational company and often have to have late night conference calls with my counterparts overseas or work with them on any problems that arise my point was its not like the rest of us nonteachers are just doing nothing after
LifeProTips,not_removed,does the word salary mean anything to you everything is illegal who can i sue
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh come off it i know plenty of teachers they work a lot but not any more than any other profession they get an entire month off in winter and two to three months off in summer even if they lesson plan for hours a day during those vacations that doesnt remotely compare to everyone else who is required to put in a full hours a week
LifeProTips,not_removed,how much do you get paid if you dont mind me asking my friend just finished studying to be a ta and she said if she gets a job the pay would be per hour for hours a day that seemed too less to me hope teachers get paid more than that at least
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah exactly im in the uk my boyfriend is a primary teacher and it was parents evening last week that meant he did just in the classroom every day last week not taking into account commuting time he doesnt get paid over time for that and he usually gets home between half and half unless he has a meeting
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing but was trying to stay apolitical
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep thats how you get barely motivated withers who do the bare minimum
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats what im trying to explain here thanks for backing me up
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats what i love about our healthcare thank god i dont have to worry about going bankrupt if i ever have cancer or something like that or a simple trip to the er
LifeProTips,not_removed,agree to disagree
LifeProTips,not_removed,sigh unzip
LifeProTips,not_removed,hows it feel to be on a list
LifeProTips,not_removed,very few but still dont underestimate the internet
LifeProTips,not_removed,traffickers know whom to target a girl at the mall who avoids eye contact when paid a compliment an angry teen posting on facebook that she hates her parents a girl who cant afford clothes trendy enough to fit in with the popular crowd similar but not the exact same from article i heard a story from a woman who was trafficked and escaped after days she said that she had sex with men in that time
LifeProTips,not_removed,when a pimp spies a girl he thinks may have low selfesteem he may say you have really beautiful eyes if the girl says thank you he moves on because she is confident enough to believe his compliment if the girl says no i dont then he continues talking because he knows she needs someone in her life to love her from httpwwwsoberinseasidecomunseentragedyrevealeddoc

LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,teachers are underpaid but this argument is and always will be nonsense
LifeProTips,not_removed,learn to teach better than anyone else and youll get a fat check too
LifeProTips,not_removed,weeks here in the usa we get a whopping httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilistofminimumannualleavebycountry god bless capitalism send help
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think the total paid furlough without special reasons is about weeks but you cant take them all at once so only a few weeks in the summer im not sure though because i havent had a job in three years
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh shit we beat sweden in something uk minimum is weeks a year
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats insane i have ten days for the whole year i didnt realize that there were minimums like that in this world
LifeProTips,not_removed,and you get paid more when youre on holiday
LifeProTips,not_removed,recent american college grad at my first real job and i had two offers one was weeks the other with
LifeProTips,not_removed,company i work at standard pto policy is weeks first year then then weeks after years
LifeProTips,not_removed,that cant be true im in ny and worked at low paying nonprofits and also huge city also relatively low paying nonprofits and have always gotten weeks these were not really nice jobs
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work in the us and i get five weeks more like days i dont think its as rare as you are making it out to be
LifeProTips,not_removed,this depends on where you work most competitive employers give weeks at start plus holidays and it goes up after years this is pretty standard unless you work for a small business or a really small nonprofit of course this is in professional positions minimum wage job all bets are off
LifeProTips,not_removed,well that sounds pretty awful my country pretty much shut down during the summer because everyone takes their vacation weeks at the same time
LifeProTips,not_removed,but not in the firstest world
LifeProTips,not_removed,implying america isnt a first world country lolok
LifeProTips,not_removed,the numbered worlds have nothing to do with prosperity world countries were us aligned during the cold war and world countries were soviet aligned the world was neutral sweden was a world country
LifeProTips,not_removed,my high school latin book today have been used since the and are discontinued at this point theyre still the best for learning and its not life the language has changed that much but there are still many classes with books older than the students all over our district
LifeProTips,not_removed,well i guess you know a different sort of teachers than i do
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i work it out for the amount of hours we actually work its about an hour
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,a list of parents who adopted downloaded children pretty nice thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,isnt that just anger management issues i dont want to undermine your disorders you can have them if you want but the names for those disorders just never spring to mind as extremely volatile emotions
LifeProTips,not_removed,r lee ermey in full metal jacket
LifeProTips,not_removed,what cmon ref thats a bullshit call and you know it
LifeProTips,not_removed,so you clearly have zero idea how the pay scale works with teachers
LifeProTips,not_removed,in america do you have unions and things seems a bit like youve been so anti socialist that as a nation you side a lot more with business than you do workers
LifeProTips,not_removed,never should have left the empire mate we get weeks a year
LifeProTips,not_removed,the majority of americans with paid vacation dont even use it its a cultural difference that leads to not enough people seriously pushing for global vacation time there is a stereotype of americans as lazy but its not really true you can be fat and a hardworker in fact we are probably hypercompetitive
LifeProTips,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofminimumannualleavebycountry helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
LifeProTips,not_removed,zero guaranteed but i am only and i get over five weeks of vacation a year
LifeProTips,not_removed,blink if you want me to kill you not help you
LifeProTips,not_removed,teachers get a hell of a lot more than zero by the way here in massachusetts the average teacher salary is now over a year
LifeProTips,not_removed,so um what do you do
LifeProTips,not_removed,did they differ in some other aspect then i have a longer paid vacation but on the other hand i dont get paid overtime luckily there isnt much overtime for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,from my and my parents experience with nonprofits they tend to give slightly better packages because the fact they cant pay enough to compete against other places so they have a slightly better vacation package turn over at nonprofits tends to be higher as well so accumulation isnt an issue
LifeProTips,not_removed,i suppose it can vary by state since things like minimum wage are decided on the state level im in wa
LifeProTips,not_removed,im blue collar and in my industry anything significant wont kick in till after years or so i just started somewhere new a month or so ago and i get a week of vacation after a year
LifeProTips,not_removed,from my expirience any minimum wage or hourly job in ny you dont have any paid vacation days no paid sick days depending on the company youre looking at termination for unexcused sick day even though its unpaid to several even at the strip club i worked at even though i wasnt technically an employee i didnt get paid to work there i paid them to work there i had to bring in a doctors note if i missed a day i was on the schedule for or risk at minimum a dollar fine
LifeProTips,not_removed,our books were in pretty bad shape and they continued to use books from the through my graduation from hs in imagine how a book looks after kids using them for years
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah you know liars or complainers in the winter and summer while they may not be completely off they are still not working hour days for the most part for months at a time the rest of us you know work year around
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a very stable person typically and i really dont remember hitting him i just remember snapping back and his nose was bloody i remember when i get pissed off and its not like we were arguing before hand and taking eachothers fries was never a cause of argumentas long as it wasnt half the damn things but like i said this was one fry i just snapped for no reason other than that my emotions are extremely erratic because of how my disorders have manifested im just happy im able to hold a jobif i could find a new one and live a normal life without any medications
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont test me bitch theyll keep coming
LifeProTips,not_removed,you clearly dont see the business side of being the best in existence
LifeProTips,not_removed,a lot of people here seem to have this temporarily embarrassed millionaire complex at least the people who voted in our current government theyre vehemently against handouts ie welfare ubi socialized or single payer medicine etc theyre barely scraping by but they vote in the interest of corporations and against themselves because free enterprise dammit and someday theyll be rich too and not want to pay all those pesky taxes or theyve gotten their head above water and are middle class so either a well i did it so can everyone else they dont need welfare or b i work my ass off to make ends meet and put my kids through college im not paying any more taxes to benefit people poorer than me usually both before reddit eats me alive yes this is only one demographic of people yes there are socialist leaning and capitalist leaning people on both sides of the party line yes a lot of it is perpetuated by corruption and ignored by people or overshadowed by other issues rather than being blatantly voted for
LifeProTips,not_removed,is it too late to change our minds i hear britain is looking for a new relationship

LifeProTips,not_removed,pay and professional development
LifeProTips,not_removed,why explain this tactic on reddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,im trying to understand this tip but the language barrier is somehow bothering me could you elaborate with an example
LifeProTips,not_removed,the last part was very well put and empowering loved it thanks for the tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is known as socratic argumentation and in addition to debates it does work tremendously well as a general communication strategy ask lots of short openended questions and contribute strategically to advance goals or just the conversation appearing earnest is definitely a must in all circumstances in debates you replace the back and forth argument with a discussion of your colleagues misunderstandings you can socially align yourself with them while whittling away at their viewpoints i always considered this approach to be handing them rope till they hang themselves the only times i find this approach antagonizes people is when those people are being intentionally dishonest the difference between getting to share what you know and having to think something up that makes this conversational approach a valuable social cipher as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,works really well when debating with many extreme liberals whos arguments tend to be fueled mostly by personal opinions and high emotion content im not by any means a die hard conservative but more of a libertarian so im not just being biased here either
LifeProTips,not_removed,this post reminded me of my bankruptcy prof who was also a sitting judge at the time someone would ask about a scenario a little different than the text and the prof would ask something like imagine your the debtor or creditor or trustee what would you argue essentially turning the question back to us and adding nothing to the discussion people just stopped coming to class
LifeProTips,not_removed,very well put its rare to see such an articulate and well written post
LifeProTips,not_removed,this seems like more of a tip on how to piss them off further and make any onlookers think youre an asshole than an attempt to deescalate an emotional person if anyone wants a real lpt dont get off on causing someone elses emotional stunt it makes you look as immature as they do
LifeProTips,not_removed,how do you feel about his tactics
LifeProTips,not_removed,why
LifeProTips,not_removed,very interesting i wasnt aware of its socratic background i work in sales and only recently realized how much overlap this technique has with salesmanship the key of course being to keep a prospect talking
LifeProTips,not_removed,at the risk of getting partisan herethose on the left certainly do tend to more guilty of this than others largely due to the emotion factor no matter what your case is emotion should be subtracted from it
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the point here this is meant to address arguments that arent reasonable enough to merit a traditional exchange of points and counterpoints this is a tool to address jet fuel cant melt steel beams or the earth is years old type arguments i dont even enjoy debating people like that much anymore but when i do its fun to yank the cognitive carpet out of from under them
LifeProTips,not_removed,tips fedora
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah if you have the right point of view on a subject but are a little too passionate about it being emotionally baited while asking to elaborate more and more youre bound to make a mistake having that mistake jumped on regardless of how relevant it is to the argument is not a counter argument its a logical fallacy by that other person now on outrageous claims for example global warming not existing this works but i used to have a friend who used this technique in every argument even if he was wrong or right
LifeProTips,not_removed,what are tactics
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a science teacher this is a core pedagogical method too its much easier to get people to learn something once they realize they dont know wtf theyre talking about good way to hit on people too having someone ask you questions and genuinely listening is very selfaffirming and endearing keep a prospect talking
LifeProTips,not_removed,why are the tactics significant
LifeProTips,not_removed,yea i think half the battle is getting them to realize how flawed their argument is in the hopes they quietly rethink it afterward
LifeProTips,not_removed,wrong time to walk out once a person knows they dont know something and should they are very open to suggestion and direction a few more questions leading them toward looking at things your way then walk out this way they get started looking at things a new way and you can let them quietly rethink things just pointing out flaws without giving some scaffolding for future development inst going to affect opinions in the long term theyll ignore you and your conversation and settle right back to what they believe
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a good point i suppose i just always assume that nobodys mind is ever going to be changed in the course of a single debate but i think youre correct here
LifeProTips,not_removed,i suppose i just always assume that nobodys mind is ever going to be changed in the course of a single debate not with that attitude
LifeProTips,not_removed,better write it down i keep a notepad app on my phone for this exact reason
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like to make it into a song i taught my kids our phone number when they were small by singing it to the camp town races tune
LifeProTips,not_removed,the point of this lpt is to avoid this exact step
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok so fair warning this book is full of hippy nonsense but there are a few good nuggets in among the horse apples theres a great chapter about this in by martha beck she calls it the inner lizard its rooted in the human fight or flight reflex and here is the basic for dealing with it down at the bottom of the page
LifeProTips,not_removed,im going to lose everything is just a thought you dont have to believe it you dont even have a way of knowing if its true its a prediction of a possible future most of those turn out to be mistaken does believing it help you in any way does it make your life better when youre thinking that thought how do you treat the people you love how do you treat yourself who would you be if that thought was no longer available to you what would you be doing how would you be feeling how would you treat yourself and those around you without the thought can you see a reason to let the thought go dont work at letting it go just see if there might be a reason to let it go im not going to lose everything could that be just as true
LifeProTips,not_removed,it sounds like your anxiety is pretty intense i think you should see a therapist and he probably will be able to prescribe something that can help
LifeProTips,not_removed,take more vitamin d idk im the same way i literally feel like im being eaten from the inside out i can say spending as much time with friends and family really helps me
LifeProTips,not_removed,just remember it only took you this long to get this far and you didnt know what you were doing even if you lose everything youll get it back faster next time you also cant lose credentials and past experience as in work experience also playing rust will help you get over this in no time
LifeProTips,not_removed,i got the same worry i cant help it but dont let it stop you from living life with them and enjoying their presence try being more grateful and kind to your loved ones every moment with them every day is a gift realize that before its too late bro
LifeProTips,not_removed,read the stoics i recommend starting with meditations by marcus aurelius the general takeaway is nothing matters because we all die anyway lol but its strangely soothing
LifeProTips,not_removed,the world is full of sorrow the root of sorrow of is attachment this simple phrase answers the most important questions in the world no attachment no fear no attachment no anxiety
LifeProTips,not_removed,become a stoic all things will be lost eventually it cannot be helped accept this and cherish the time you have
LifeProTips,not_removed,sell everything so that you dont have anything to lose
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry for posting twice but it reminded me of a joke hope you laugh a husband died the other day he put a ring on
LifeProTips,not_removed,ill definitely check that out today thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is some deep stuff thanks for your input
LifeProTips,not_removed,these are great questions to ask ones self appreciate that
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think this should be the second option if trying to overcome this on his own doesnt work out people are too quick to medicate sometimes and that stuff has serious side effects
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed emphatically life is as life is once you accept the fact that everything is momentary a grater acceptance of the beauty in the perceived flaws dissipates
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not sure how this makes me feellol
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol i dont care about my belongings its my family and career mainly
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,this pattern of selfinquiry is described in byron katies book loving what is four questions that can change your life i found it very helpful
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree i dont want to take medication if i dont have to id love to know some other alternatives before taking that route
LifeProTips,not_removed,for the anxiety outside of medication i recommend mindfulness meditation and other tricks under dialectical spelling behavioral therapy also my counselor says the things most important for mental health are water nutrition and sleep yes sometimes mental health issues do not necessarily indicate a mental illness nor do they necessarily have to be treated with medication although for some like myself medication is an absolute necessity often when someone gets psychiatric medicine the first one either doesnt work or it causes side effects everyones body has a unique chemistry and what works for one may not for another if necessary it is important to keep working with meds even if you have to change them several times before finding a good one
LifeProTips,not_removed,therapist and psychologists and psychiatrists dont always go medication route i have a friend who is on meds and therapy and she was just doing therapy first while she did end up having a problem bigger than she could handle without some chemical help they gave her a lot of great tools to control her anxiety without those the pills honestly wouldnt help that much ive been in her life for years and most of her journey to get better and the difference its made for her is incredible i really recommend going to one and if you dont feel like they take you seriously find one that will a lot of communities have low cost counciling services if your insurance isnt helpful tldr professionals have toolkits for you not always meds
LifeProTips,not_removed,great info thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt march has days
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt it is march in some places in the world
LifeProTips,not_removed,today is march at least est tomorrow is april
LifeProTips,not_removed,great prank everybody
LifeProTips,not_removed,there could be many reasons why this happened none of which would be easy for anyone on reddit to understand when theres just one paragraph of text but more important is that it really doesnt matter everybody has offweeks it is probablynot the first week of a worse version of yourself except if you now focus on it too much and get nervous the next time you pick up a violin selffulfilling prophecy et cetera all will be right probably
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had off years lol dont let it to become psychological and jinx yourself or it might turn into a month
LifeProTips,not_removed,if its just a week you could be starting to get sick wash your hands more often nearing excessivity i also suggest drinking a lot of watergatorade and eating a ton of fruit pickles or sauerkraut to help with defecation its not glamourous but it helps with things to that effect if it gets worse hit up a doctor above all else just try to feel good everyone has bad weeks
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt worry about it ive had a really off week too heres to next week ay
LifeProTips,not_removed,stay positive eat healthy and drink water youll be alright its just an off week
LifeProTips,not_removed,focus on the activity of what you are actually doing not the fact that you are not good at it if you are in school and you are learning a new subject and just think oh jeez i have no idea what he is talking about then you will never learn anything it is when you actually start listening where you can pinpoint when the actual learning started
LifeProTips,not_removed,take some time off if possible days sounds like you may be on a soccer team andor in a band so that can be tough but a break makes a big difference a lot of time we begin to fail because we overthink or try to force improvement in our muscle memory which is all music and sports are we often think that the worse we are doing the more we need to practice which although true to an extent can sometimes end up reinforcing badlazy habits take some time off let your fingers and feet relax for a couple of days and they will come back refreshed and ready to go
LifeProTips,not_removed,its okay this happens with me every now and then i just try to do things more carefully and keep an eye out for trouble and avoid it
LifeProTips,not_removed,have you been looking at your httpwwwbiorhythmcalculatornet keep practicing
LifeProTips,not_removed,no drugs and im a male i live around sacramento in cali no supplements either
LifeProTips,not_removed,ex talking to hr ryan always shoots down my ideas in meetings and never even considers my proposals i think he has a personal issue with me vs the way ryan shut down my budget proposal at todays meeting without considering its merits leads me to think that he has a personal problem with me
LifeProTips,not_removed,to get someone to do or think what you want them to think provide evidence to allow them to come to that conclusion although biased by themselves it puts them in a position where they feel the need to prove they are right for coming to that conclusion
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed would also suggest shortening to never exaggerate
LifeProTips,not_removed,hello uthemagicalyang thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons medical tips including practicing medicine eyevision skin care dental advice dietnutrition birth control sex tips and mental health if you would like to appeal this decision httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetorlifeprotips do not repost without explicit permission from the moderators make sure you rlifeprotipsaboutsidebar before submitting thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,actually it sounds like youre a normal healthy person but the resolution to fear is not the idiotic no fear bullshit you read on beverage cans or hear about from pseudo brave athletes no you need to accept the fear dig into it roll it around a bit taste it give it a lick and tickle then realize that fear is a valuable friend and a good ally fear is natures pause button telling you hold up think about this for a second once you come to accept and understand that its natures way of telling you whoa this could be bad its much easier to work through fear train the fear out of your reactions and move on thats the key really acknowledge the fear understand that its doing its job then working with and through the fear using your hopefully big brain training is all about learning to react appropriately to events while under stress and experiencing fear this is why we train across the board military firemen law enforcement motocross etc its where courage comes from not just military but anyone who accepts and feels the fear and moves forward anyway you train and train accepting the fear until its little more than that subtle twinge a reminder to be alert this could be dangerous its how you can be getting shot at and not panic how a fireman can run into the burning building how the jet pilot flies at the edge and how an xgames sociopath can be stories in the air and land with clean britches its all about practice training and exposure the more you do a thing the more you expose yourself to the fear and make it your friend the less you will be paralyzed by fear react poorly to it and ultimately fail due to fear which is way way more common than youd think theres a reason that get back on that horse is a thing cause if you put it off fear which should be your friend becomes that fire breathing nightmare you just cannot work around so driving over was exciting when i was then a few track days later and lots of exposure that fear is gone i know what that is and the bar moves forward to or so before the edge shows up and it gets pushed back some more training practice exposure and repetition all push fear further out its still there better be anyway but instead of yelling and shouting it quietly reminds you to focus and pay attention you will reach a point where what youre doing looks like madness russians in high places anyone to most people but is pretty basic day to day stuff to you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think thats a healthy fear keeps you alive longer that said if youre concerned about fear of failure that is a different thing than being safe give yourself permission to fail not get hit by a car i may be presumptuous in thinking that youre ok with wearing protective gear and practicing in a safe context once youre skilled enough you can graduate to other contexts
LifeProTips,not_removed,also if you go around the end of the sale week they have vegetables and fruit for cheap never had a problem with their quality as long as i used them in days
LifeProTips,not_removed,my neighborhood supermarket has bakery items on discount right before closing time never heard of an early morning discount
LifeProTips,not_removed,same with meatbread even if you dont use it right away freezing it works well too
LifeProTips,not_removed,or if you cant eat them right away just freeze it
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds like youre trying to do too much and spreading your energy on friendships too thin accept that old friends can move on its very natural in life to lose old friends particularly when someones status changes such as they have kids get married get a job that really consumes them or move away this will continue to happen until and past you retire second comes the point that friendships shouldnt require work if youre motivated to keep in touch with them youll keep in touch with them if theyre motivated to keep in touch with you its vice versa it shouldnt feel like an obligation but a pleasant activity sure theres a certain civility in staying in touch but if youre talking to dead air or you really dont have much in common again its okay to let the friendship slide with good memories rather than a slight bitterness that you couldnt hook up and move on most people only have room in their lives for a few close friends and the ones that reach out to you as much as you reach out to them are often the best concentrating on those and taking advantage of opportunities to contact the others when they come up naturally such as through sending christmas cards will help maintain a balance and finally acquaintances are certainly okay too not everyone has to be your friend
LifeProTips,not_removed,these new inventions called phones allow you to talk with people even when you cant see them
LifeProTips,not_removed,you should get skype or oovoo or something of the sorts to keep up with them
LifeProTips,not_removed,it shouldnt feel like an obligation but a pleasant activity thanks i always feel like a bad guy for not putting my effort into a relationship i like you use the word pleasant activity to replace obligation really while the later makes me feel like something i have to do out of my guilt the previous one does not only makes me feel like its something i want to do but also something that i can enjoy and cherish because its not so common in short i used to think maintaining a relationship is like having a daily meal a task you must do everyday but now i feel like its more about having a fancy meal at a high class restaurant you dont have to do it often but every single opportunity is a great and joyful experience thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,glad you appreciated but that being said things change if theyre a friend thats going through some sort of a bad time then some effort investment may be necessary
LifeProTips,not_removed,not much else you can do in that situation im afraid ive been in a similar situation just make sure he knows youre there if needs you
LifeProTips,not_removed,call him every day even if just to bullshit
LifeProTips,not_removed,be available even when it is inconvenient and uncomfortable people do and say the strangest things when they are hurt listen sometimes no advice is needed best of luck to you your friend and their mother
LifeProTips,not_removed,what i am advising is only for a very close friend none of this would be appropriate otherwise what helped me as my dad lie in a comma with death near was my closest and very long term friend took me to inane no thought involved or required silly events nothing serious and nothing particularity great or outstanding just no thought silly stuff let one get ones mind off of things she took me and my kids to chuck e cheese we had never been before and it was stupid but it was still the exact right thing also my wife took me to see that dumb no count movie ted stupid yes but i giggled myself all through it nothing heavy or thought provoking was the key it gave my mind a much needed break my friend drove a long distance just to take me to a chuck e cheese and it was brilliant
LifeProTips,not_removed,im sorry but this is not a request for a lpt but a specific situation maybe try rself or a similar subreddit beat of luck to your friend op
LifeProTips,not_removed,doing all the homework problems in the applicable chapters even if they arent assigned
LifeProTips,not_removed,get off reddit and read works every time of the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,write down everything your prof says in a lecture then no more than a few hours later rewrite it for clarity expanding on what might seem tricky the evening before you test reread your edited notes if the prof tests from his lectures they usually do youll ace it every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,weed or intercourse maybe both
LifeProTips,not_removed,teaching others especially people under your cognitive level that way they ask simple but interesting questions you learn more each time you answer
LifeProTips,not_removed,find a workplace where you wont get distracted easily libraries are fantastic because its quiet and everyone else is doing work so you might as well be productive
LifeProTips,not_removed,personally i found studying before bedtime or a nap can really help cramming a day or so before was always my method but i heard in college that sleeping is what helps create long term memories because of that i began to study before getting ready for bed study again as soon as i got up in the morning and again right before the test or exam i know this doesnt work for everyone but maybe it helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,personally i listen to a study playlist and take breaks often also beginning to study as early as possible works great and makes it much less stressful
LifeProTips,not_removed,setting an alarm for min and a min break works for me teaching others also helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,set a goal or aim of your life then plan gradually preparation for it discover the recommended steps for study work the student feeling mostly an open greenery fields with a set of study materials and a good team to group discussions to develop their skills and an important is to participate in sports practice it daily before sunrise or evening in the fresh air and keeping or arranging books is an art if you keep the books your way when you reaches the feeling of yours more interest to study value the books
LifeProTips,not_removed,what time of day are you able to focus the most for me it is in the morning right after breakfast i do my hardest subjectsrequire most amount of energy at that time when im at my peak in the afternoon or later at night i work on lower energy tasks
LifeProTips,not_removed,learn how you learn thats the fastest way you need to learn what works for you and build on that over time telling you what works for me may be enlightening but you may be really different for instance i like to skim through textbooks or materials ahead of time then when i reread it i like to start from the middle or skip the first at least also i dont take or keep notes i listen and think about the material in class i make direct connections to the material like oooh yea my friend once said turtles were made to burrow that method helps me remember the material in class if i get bored i read the textbook or do the homework class is super focused for me and if i need to do homework outside of class i like to go somewhere busy to give me that same sense of urgency another secret is if you have a hard topic or project or anything the next day plan prep the night before it could be as simple as putting out clothes for the next day packing your bag or googling the topic to frame the information basically i frame the information familiarize with the terminology then customize how my brain catalogs the information by connecting it to things i already understand keep in mind if you start a topic that you are totally new to like organic chemistry give yourself a long time horizon to familiarize yourself with the topic so start looking up terms formulas etc like a week before starting your official learning then once you start learning go easy on yourself your first run through will be almost all wrong but that small sliver of knowledge will be like a thread to create a solid knit for your education foundation i say learn how you learn there are a lot of great resources on how people learn making suggestions that may help you see what niche of learning style you may be
LifeProTips,not_removed,i can confirm weed works
LifeProTips,not_removed,recently found out it has a name httpsenwikipediaorgwikipomodorotechnique
LifeProTips,not_removed,ssssssssh gifting loud toys to children is the most socially acceptable passiveaggressive way to cause misery to their parents lets not mess that up
LifeProTips,not_removed,just wait until they get into remote control cars and start leaving them on stairs or you get the call from mrs lanster nextdoor because your kids camera drone was hovering next to her teenage daughters bathroom window again as you extricate yourself from the messy pile of your own limbs at the bottom of the flight that you just fell down or try to convince the cop at your door that youre confiscating the drone and it wont happen again youll look back fondly on the days of fisher price
LifeProTips,not_removed,so much this why cant the toy makers include a sound off switch or volume control
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont have children and bask in the glory of silence
LifeProTips,not_removed,i actually do this with my phone watching videos even on the lowest volume late at night is stupid loud
LifeProTips,not_removed,super glue works wonders too and a pair of pliers
LifeProTips,not_removed,a hammer works so does silicon adhesive filling the speaker vents
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,we were born to be enemies
LifeProTips,not_removed,because your kids camera drone was hovering next to her teenage daughters bathroom window again i dont know whether id be disgusted or proud of my kid for that
LifeProTips,not_removed,costs money which interferes with profits and gives something else on the toy that might break
LifeProTips,not_removed,loud toys save lives
LifeProTips,not_removed,put a little dab of glue into the speaker grill rub it around let dry soooo much better now
LifeProTips,not_removed,why not just cut the speaker wire
LifeProTips,not_removed,hands you parent of the year award
LifeProTips,not_removed,adult level master
LifeProTips,not_removed,you monster
LifeProTips,not_removed,what youd do is youd yell at your kid to never do that again and then when he leaves all mad because youre confiscating his shit give a knowing nod and wink to his mom five gets you ten shed smile back
LifeProTips,not_removed,no need to get all hostile some powered toys do more than just produce sound
LifeProTips,not_removed,monday mine is always on monday
LifeProTips,not_removed,unfortunately that just how life works its tough to keep those relationship going especially after you get older however i am firm believer that when one door closes another one opens its important to cherish the past but not to hold on to it
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah ive had this recently im approaching my and a lot of people who i thought were friends have pretty much falling by the waist side threw no fault of my own i got tired of being the only one making plans and getting the group together so i stopped because it didnt feel like a real friendship i never heard from them and still havent for months i guess i agreed with the top comment one door opens when others close never give up on people who could potential be a great friends
LifeProTips,not_removed,as i read your story it made me reflect on my friends since grade and now were almost so many tragedies have happen and deaths bdays lifes important events having kids etc its good to be there when you can my best friend just found out she has breast cancer so how i can help is giving her daughter rides to volleyball and stuff sometimes we all get in stupid arguments or dont talk for weeks but we love each other when my dad died i hadnt seen my friends in forever all the sudden there was five friends at his house we were waiting for the coroner to get there which took like two hours they stayed with me as i balled my brains out and cried in his bed they helped me clean his rental so i could get his deposit back to help with the cremation just enjoy your life and friendships make time love love love good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,very true thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,same i try to gather the group together but they make excuses and say in the future without making any plans i wonder what will happen later on in life were in our early still in uni i might be overthinking everything at the moment because i am overwhelmed by school at the moment thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok captain hindsight
LifeProTips,not_removed,also though make it easy for the people youre supervising to say actually no i dont need your help its a completely different situation to yours but at my work theres one supervisor who comes in always asking if theres something they can do but it often completely ruins our flow having to accommodate an extra person who doesnt know exactly what to do supervisor or not
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes when i managed people id also always ask anything you need from me before i go as i was leaving usually id wind up doing something tedious that nobody else wanted to do but it kept everyone happier
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is great can you engineer cars too i helped my sister in law replace an idler arm pulley and had to unmount the motor and jack it up just to get to the damn thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt when designing anything get feedback and input from the people that will actually use the end product before it goes into production
LifeProTips,not_removed,an intern was allowed to make these sort of design change decisions
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you want to learn about empowering employees to put in feedback read up on the toyota production system specifically the continous improvement aspect you would be interested in
LifeProTips,not_removed,totally agree you dont want to cross the line from trying to help to i want to be involved if you can do it better without me or know it better id prefer to stay out of your way and let you do your thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel your pain changing the spark plugs on a subaru led to me cursing the names of the engineers that were so heartless buddy of mine had an old audi iirc that in order to replace the ac pressure lines you needed to drop the fucking subframe he just sold it instead what a shitshow
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes in the end its mostly arbitrary placement unless youre doing something crazy its just mounting parts on a baseplate with no structural aspects besides sitting on the floor none of the system design changed just adjusting mounting dimensions moving the motor doesnt affect anything as long as the change is within the couplerkeyway specs which it was
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks for the reference ill definitely check it out
LifeProTips,not_removed,goddamn sounds like selling it rather than fixing it was a good idea

LifeProTips,not_removed,ex talking to hr ryan always shoots down my ideas in meetings and never even considers my proposals i think he has a personal issue with me vs the way ryan shut down my budget proposal at todays meeting without considering its merits leads me to think that he has a personal problem with me
LifeProTips,not_removed,how on earth would it make all the difference in the world i will text my friendsfamily to make sure its ok to call them but i might not want them to call me right at that moment

LifeProTips,not_removed,if you say can you call me it means to call right away if you say can you call me in a few minutes it means call you in a few minutes
LifeProTips,not_removed,ranging from my parents to girlfriends it shows that yes you can talk on the phone but also you want to thats a huge difference from just yeah i dont have an option just remembered this hilarious video replace come over with can i call you
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe were understanding ops differently i see it as me hey usqrlchez can i call you ops lpt seems to say you should call me right back and not just text yes maybe i am sitting on the toilet and will call you when i finish my sinful business
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont text me from the toilet but seriously op is being overly dramatic with saying all the difference in the world
LifeProTips,not_removed,what happens if your phone dies would you have to wait until you got a new phone
LifeProTips,not_removed,not necessarily when you turn on on some services they will give you a list of backup codesoffline tokens usually that you can use in the event that your device is lostwithout power most services that offer two factor have an option to remember this device so you dont have to input the token every time or for at least days some services note your usual pattern of logging in from a particular ip address and computer and wont issue a challenge unless you try to login from another locationdevice
LifeProTips,not_removed,rpersonalfinance
LifeProTips,not_removed,find something to save up for and open a new bank account specifically for it then make a budget based on bills you know youll have to pay out of every paycheck and with a little bit of money for incidentals or things are less essential one tip i always hear is to withdraw in cash an amount to use for incidentals each weekpay round and then bank the rest that way youve only got that limited cash amount for the week rather than the entire amount in your account
LifeProTips,not_removed,try ynab httpswwwyouneedabudgetcom
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is going to sound crazy but make a flow chart for purchases is this a personal item will you actually use this is it cheap odds are you shouldnt buy it is this really a grocery item is it relatively healthynutritious and will it last long if it will buy it if it wont please rethink the purchase do you really need this starbucks drink its overpriced and fattening invest in a water bottle and bring that to work with you every day instead honestly as long as you ask yourself these questions and think about them rationally while youre shopping then youll purchase less crap save money im not saying you should never spend anything and just save save save but it does help to have some sort of weekly or monthly goal after getting your paycheck decide a certain amount of money to put in your savings ie budget your money this is the most basic financial habit divide up your money on what youll spend it on bills necessities personal items and savings keep the personal spending small
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont form bad money habits
LifeProTips,not_removed,his book total money makeover changed my life
LifeProTips,not_removed,would reccommend and read their wiki
LifeProTips,not_removed,like what your necktie size a business card is intended to communicate everything required to contact you thats its purpose if youre writing additional information on it just because you want to impress youre going to look weird because its not standard practice yes if you have a specific purpose for that additional information examples might include if youre going to be available to respond on a certain date for the next interaction no as a general guidance
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think the idea is the make it more personalized so theyre more likely to contact you many people have piles of business cards of former acquaintances theyll never read

LifeProTips,not_removed,the would seem to be an appropriate countdown track
LifeProTips,not_removed,nah itd sound like youre covering up the sounds of murder or playing it as you cried yourself to suicide
LifeProTips,not_removed,rshowerthoughts
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats only if you are solely playing the intro from of beethoven
LifeProTips,not_removed,better than most
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think thats because most have never been properly exposed to it
LifeProTips,not_removed,what about classical from within the last years
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work at an it helpdesk and i say this a lot when you answer a call and ask someone some basic information and you can hear them making deep sighs you know its going to be a fun client to deal with i try and shift the hate as much as possible by saying things like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i was a waiter i use to say sorry about your weight they never knew
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt when working in retail quit and never look back edit for real just get a job at a bar or as a waiter or something every job is gonna suck on some level but theres something about being around those plodding meatbag consumers all day that will make you want to rip your teeth out
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry for your patience ii mean thank you for the wait damn it
LifeProTips,not_removed,what you really want to do is poke them in the chest and say screw you buddy you can wait longer and then chug a beer in their face
LifeProTips,not_removed,at a funeral dont say sorry for your loss because its a very negative phrase sorry implies that the deceaseds demise was the fault of the speaker instead say thanks for inviting me to this little shindig while drinking red wine out of a diet coke can
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank god i dont work in the service industry anymore i hate people trying to micro manage my language
LifeProTips,not_removed,say what ever the fuck you want working in retail you dont get paid enough to get that much of a fuck
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive unfortunately worked and supervised retail stores before and customers arent going to fall for this op the type of person that gets upset about sorry for the wait is also the type of person that will get upset by thank you for your patience dont thank me hurry up and fix it no thank you for wasting my fucking time if you have time to thank me then get me what i asked for etc people that think these types of fake courtesies works on customers has likely never worked in a busy retail store
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree maybe in general it has a better effect but personally i much prefer something like sorry about the wait its much less formal and i find it more relatable thank you for your patience sounds like that person was forced to say that by whatever company they worked for ive never been offended either way and it doesnt make much difference at all to me since ill only be dealing with that person for minutes at most
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt never work in retail
LifeProTips,not_removed,i fucking hate customers so fucking bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just use both
LifeProTips,not_removed,im sorry but not apologizing in canada could lead to execution
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt if the customer is an asshole and wants a piece of shitty furniture make them wait minutes and bring the most damaged box you have fuck retail
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive always found the phrase thank you for your patience condescending if im made to wait because of the servers fault i would want an apology rather than a vote of thanks maybe im being a bit too harsh edit wow this blew up couple of things i would like to add its not my fault it is x persons fault why should i apologise when i go to an establishment and one person steps up to serve me for me that person represents the establishment it should not matter to a customer whether theres a large party at the next table or whether the folks in the kitchen are slacking off or whether the delivery truck is impounded or whether the flight is delayed because of the ground crew all a customer sees is that they have a representative of the establishment it sucks to be that representative in that momentoftruth which is a legit concept in retail marketing sure but thats how retail businesses work busy times of the day yeah if an establishment is unable to scale up to demand they should not offer service in such windows to the late customers service is offered with an implication of a pleasant experience and if the establishment is unable to provide this experience its better to push the customer away beforehand than leave the customer fuming having said that ive personally never held the establishment responsible at such times the tone matters yes of course it does even so a sorry in any tone is better in this situation than a thank you in the same tone sorry accepting blame im sorry but this just isnt true
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel exactly the opposite about these phrases thank you for your patience sounds contrived and doesnt accept responsibility sorry for the wait is what an honest person would say
LifeProTips,not_removed,speaking from my perspective in the southtexas people will be rude regardless of what i say its really just dependent on the person
LifeProTips,not_removed,or in a perfect world people could stop being entitled dicks
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt in retail you arent being paid enough to give a fuck and so you shouldnt
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry is a magical word in retail this is drivel
LifeProTips,not_removed,dae feel like this just reinforces one of the biggest insecurities that almost all corporations seem to have these days no one ever admits fault takes full responsibility and owns up to their mistakes
LifeProTips,not_removed,id disagree it sounds less personal and more robotic
LifeProTips,not_removed,it might work on average but honestly id be more annoyed with thank you for your patience than sorry for xyz the latter is acknowledging that there actually was a problem the former is not only ignoring that completely but is assuming that a i actually have patience and b that i must have given it to them because they deserve it hell no
LifeProTips,not_removed,people arent paid enough to give this much of a shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a customer i feel thank you for your patience is condescending and sorry for your wait implies empathy
LifeProTips,not_removed,agree with others thank you for your patience reeks of automated systems that keep you on hold and it triggers me in any context now
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting only negative responses too this ive actually found this to be true working in the service industry for years i do however think it depends a little on the situation if i wasnt doing my job properly and communicating to my customers before they got to the point of anger i would apologize if i was insanely busy and got to them as soon as humanly possible and let them know that i would help them as soon as i could i would thank them for their patience genuinely
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i worked in customer service i always said thanks for your patience but it was because im an angry mean person and i didnt care enough to be sorry i work back of the house now
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes we make people wait just to fuck with them thank you for your patience heres your order
LifeProTips,not_removed,i despise idiots like you op
LifeProTips,not_removed,no fucking way op yes that would be better to say to the average good person well your average customer at least in america is an asswipe they dont care if they are patient or impatient the customer is always right and its the employees duty to provide the service sorry for the wait if the service i provide actually takes extra time shows im taking responsibility for that that way you wont get the average american fuckwipe screaming at your ear to hurry up
LifeProTips,not_removed,i quit my retail job of years today because my manager said all part timers dont do shit and are lazy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think it depends on the context thank you for your patience only works if you say it as youre handing over their goods sorry for the waittrouble works better when they have to wait and theres nothing you can do about it whereas saying thank you for your patience in this instance could come off as slightly condescending the thank you part being premature and the your patience seeming underhandedly demanding
LifeProTips,not_removed,stop encouraging what george carlin called the pussification of society boo
LifeProTips,not_removed,years retail most in management this is a shitty tip make it personal i am sorry that took so long i have defused people that were threatening violence with that
LifeProTips,not_removed,i find this to come off a bit condescending you have no idea of the person was patient only that they controlled their behavior if you apologize for the wait it means you the business recognize the issue directly
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant be the only one but i see sorry for the wait as them saying they aim to serve you faster next time and thank you for the patiencewait as this is are bog standard speed deal with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,live in the uk sorry for the wait would be fine thank you for your patience would be a little condescending too much customer sounds fake and can make people uncomfortable
LifeProTips,not_removed,in the downward spiral of this sub this is possibly one of the worst lpts ive read in two years we are all dumber for having listened to you and i have now filtered out this subreddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i partially disagreeif you can convey and command empathy its better to say sorry for the wait or just sorry in general yes it is negative the customer is likely feeling negative about their situation and sorry conveys understanding of that and guilt people dont generally attack the wounded they go for the defended appear wounded when you say sorry convey your own pain in the fact that they waited or in any situation you are apologizing for and theyll see that as you being wounded its why i often beat myself up people usually see how hard im taking it out on myself and theyll hold back their own punches
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a dealer at a casino were told explicitly to never say sorry to a player or anything like that there are a few exemptions it implies responsibility for whatever happened bad cards dice roll drink service whatever by saying sorry youve now taken ownership of that mistake when in fact we really had nothing to do with it that aside it helps to retarget their frustrations elsewhere away from you i see now you addressed this taking responsibility for something you didnt directly cause is a good way to have a terrible time at work when someone gets mad
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is bullshit you think people are that stupid if you are fucking them you cannot just change the words sounds like you work for verizon thank you for your patience idiot
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt people who are miserable are gonna be shitty no matter how you try to life hack them
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have never apologised for a customer having to wait in a queue they want to complain fine head office maybe then they will give us more fucking staff its not my problem the company thinks we can manage short all the time my customer service is actually pretty good but i refuse to apologise for a problem thats out of my control
LifeProTips,not_removed,never apologize fuck apology nobody gives a shit about you redescribing the situation to spin it positively youre either a positive person and its obvious in a few seconds or youre not giving people acting advice is silly you being slow doesnt mean im being patient thanking me for something i didnt give you because youve declared it youre a dickhead just give me your best estimate of when im getting what i want and piss off i dont need your philosophy of life
LifeProTips,not_removed,in retail you must always speak like you are talking to year olds
LifeProTips,not_removed,on the other hand thanking someone for their patience presumes they have been patient which might seem insulting to a person who is feeling very impatient and really wants an apology for the delay its kind of in the same league as the veiled demand of thanks in advance for your cooperation
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt suck dicks for money its fast and profitable
LifeProTips,not_removed,working in retail long enough that i dont give a fuck about the customer
LifeProTips,not_removed,better advice dont be a douchebag customer shit happens and a lot of people are trying to do a good job beyond what you know is going on and mistakes will inevitably happen its part of the business if you find a mistake in your order dont take it out on the staff youre ordering fast food they made a mistake its ok people make mistakes the staff will almost always immediately correct the mistake if youre nice about it the additional minutes to correct the order wont impact your life at all youre ordering fast food
LifeProTips,not_removed,do not do this its a typical response from firing call centres every time u hear it i get angered because its so insincere
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive got different feeling about this when hearing sorry for the wait i feel like you are accepting your mistake you are apologizing for the caused trouble and its okay thank you for your patience makes me feel something like how do you know i am going to be patient if this takes too long i can also go search for a better restaurant shop or whatever i guess it depends if you say it during the wait or after the wait if after then yeah maybe the second option is better
LifeProTips,not_removed,this also works on some children for example if kids have to wait their turn you can sometimes shut down complainers by saying youre being so nice by letting soandso go first thank you for setting such a good example and being patient its often a total bs guilt trip but the kid sort of gets nudged back into remembering how they ought to be acting and its more pleasant than constant reprimands and punishments
LifeProTips,not_removed,nope i just say how can i help you and get on with it if they complain about waiting i straight up ignore it and move the conversation along i dont have time dont get paid enough to hear you fucking bitch
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless your british in which case you absolutely must apologise about everything everyday to every person you meet even if youve done nothing wrong its simply the british way it would be inexcusable to act in any other way and any other action must be met with the extreme use of tutting and slight head shaking
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt you can often replace sorry with thank you for so many situations in general
LifeProTips,not_removed,everytime i read these i just think yeah theyll give up on humanity when they realize what bs that is
LifeProTips,not_removed,what i do is just dont apologize for something that is out of my control and then i just start serving themtaking their orderwhatever no need for pleasantries all the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,until you get the person whos like omg wtf you cant even apologize i want to talk to your manager im suing
LifeProTips,not_removed,this goes for much more than just retail you should always spin anything into a positive if its possible focus on what you can do for the customer not whats gone wrong so far
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is practiced in professional business environments everywhere negativesin this case sorryare replaced by a positive or thank you this is bullish behavior and can get you far when dealing with upper management instead of using negative sentence structure which shows weakness you use positive structure which shows strength it may not be noticed consciously but subconsciously they pick up on it and the little ranking ladder in their head bumps you up a bracket which can open a world of opportunities
LifeProTips,not_removed,working at chick fil a which most of you know is prided on being very nice to customers we learned to not admit fault for things out of our control rather focus on fixing the situations focus on how youre making it right sometimes if we did make a mistake a short apology is in order sir we apologize for our mistake on your order but let me get those fries for you so you can be on your way etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,i understand your frustration
LifeProTips,not_removed,the essence in your lpt is that sorry for the wait is focused on you while thank you for your patience is a compliment to the other person
LifeProTips,not_removed,i also find underpromising and overdelivering is a great way to get noticed in the workplace too eg ill have that report to you by closeofbusiness then you submit it earlier than you said
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt treat the customer the way they treat you within reason you act condescending thats what you get im not your slave im not your bitch im human you get what you give
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt just dont be cunty to each other
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah no people who are angry about waiting are going to be angry no matter what you say
LifeProTips,not_removed,tough crowd op sorry
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you take responsibility for everything youre gonna be miserable not really you have to be a tough brute to not be phased by customers s but seriously people get mad at me all the time this lady tried to pay with a check and our server was down to validate the check and she got pissed off at me for it i didnt cry about it i thought about it for seconds then moved onto the next customer and had a nice conversation with them mean customers very rarely ever push mybuttons the only time i can think of it is when i was new to cashiering so i was still learning and i had to go ask how to redeem a store credit so i said im sorry just one moment i havent been trained how to accept store credits these two hispanic ladies had a youre fucking stupid tone and said oh my god just push the button and scan it then they started talking shit in spanish thinking i wouldnt understand it btw they were wrong its more than just pushing a button to accept a store credit so they were unnecessarily rude and wrong they pissed me off but other than that rude customers dont really bother me
LifeProTips,not_removed,this reminded me of the part in martin amiss money where the sign thanks the narrator for not smoking i hate that i mean its a bit previous isnt it dont you think i havent not smoked yet as it turned out i never did not smoke in the end
LifeProTips,not_removed,in addition to this switching is that all with is there anything else i can help you with has led to more interactions which leads to potentially more sales and generally a happier customer at the end of the day the former has a negative implication because it has a subtle tone of finality whereas the latter has positive implications as it engages the consumer to say something other then yeah thats all
LifeProTips,not_removed,you actually sat down and wrote all this up something inside you compelled you to type all this out for the internet
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh fuck off if someone wants to have a problem with you theyre going to have a problem they dont give a fuck what you say
LifeProTips,not_removed,false apologies are so frustrating on my daily commute to work we have hour delays at least once a week and the announcer always apologises for the delay if the train company were sorry they would improve the service theyre not on the least bit sorry
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds like nonsense an american would say and as someone from the uk i know this and it would annoy me if i heard it from someone serving me frankly im glad theyre sorry that i had to wait and im grateful for their apology rather than the assumption being made that me being forced to wait is because ive been patient i havent had a bloody choice an apology isnt necessary because im a grown up but it would be nice to hear
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt if youre working retail youve already made several grave mistakes in life
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt chew your food
LifeProTips,not_removed,saying sorry for the wait may be taking responsibility but it also implies you are responsible if the wait is due to reasons you have no control over saying thank you for your patience is a much better approach
LifeProTips,not_removed,the customer is always right no the customer is always wrong and a dumbass
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt when heading into a retail establishment acknowledge that the employees are most likely underpaid and overworked when you get upset about your coffee taking too long internalize that you are a bad person and make some changes to your life
LifeProTips,not_removed,i never apologized while working in retail unless something was actually my fault the last thing i need is the customer blaming me for something out of my control
LifeProTips,not_removed,will someone test out sorry for your patience for me and let me know how that goes thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,or people can just wait for their coffee and accept that if they dont have the time to wait for it to be made then they should have showed up earlier or not at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a waiter i know that the struggle is real when dealing with customers that dont want to really deal with any inconveniences i work at a really busy restaurant and before coming in and waiting for a table and sitting down customers should also be aware that we are busy the service wont be the same when compared to a moderately busy day but we as staff try our best to accommodate each and every customer the one time i told a customer sorry for the wait was the time that my table went up to my manager and told him about what happened i totally agree with op it makes sense that the client would think that i made a mistake and that i felt the need to apologize may i add repeatedly saying thank you for your patience on the other hand is much more productive letting the customer know that you havent forgotten about them is always good but many times you will deal with very rude people that arent willing to understand your situation as a service provider its very hard to provide fast and efficient service when you are under pressure id prefer a busy day over a slow day anytime because the time goes by relatively faster five hours feels like one to me on a busy day
LifeProTips,not_removed,its funny but when people say thanks for your patience my first instinct is to reply what choice have i got in the matter shut up and fucking deliver
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a manager at a star hotel and i tell my staff that saying sorry for the wait is the correct response if theyve been queueing up for a while nobody asked them to wait and we have to show empathy towards them for the wait they endured it is ok to say thanks for your patience if youve already spoken to them and have stepped away to do whatever you need to do though i guess the policy will vary from company to company however i feel that showing remorse for their unexpected wait is far more professional than saying thanks for something nobody asked you to do
LifeProTips,not_removed,look at all these people arguing with this as though this isnt a longestablished method of influencing people its a tactful way to establish an expected standard of behavior without being demanding its been done forever and it does work ever seen a sign that says thank you for not smoking same concept
LifeProTips,not_removed,my sister and i used to work at a retail store together we invented this game where we would say sorry about your weight to all the overweight people who came through the line
LifeProTips,not_removed,two backpackers sitting back to back to prop each other up while both pooping
LifeProTips,not_removed,as an awkward human beig id probably think to say it and fuck it up with sorry for your patience or something similar
LifeProTips,not_removed,meta lpt never apologize for something youre not actually sorry about unless youre canadian
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt try not to be a cunt
LifeProTips,not_removed,this sounds like a page right out of apples top secret retail training
LifeProTips,not_removed,i prefer sorry youre an inpatient prick people need to get their shit together if waiting in line to order coffee at a place that they know is busy and they still choose to go to is upsetting
LifeProTips,not_removed,or how bout people take the time to realize im just as pissed things are going slow as they are and we stop coddling everyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,ya i still like sorry for the wait
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have to say regardless of tone i absolutely hate when people thank me for something i never agreed to id prefer you apologize ill at least keep talking to you as youve shown regret for something outside of your control as opposed for thanking me for being inconvenienced
LifeProTips,not_removed,after about years in retail my conversations started going like this this is cheaper on your website yup this line is too long that happens
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess im the only one but i always say thanks for waiting it doesnt presume that theyve been patient but im also not apologizing for something i have no control over asshole customers will be assholes no matter what you say to them and then they wonder why nowhere has good service
LifeProTips,not_removed,itt people who do not know the difference between apologizing for ones actions and providing empathy for something that is out of everyones control you can legitimately feel sorry for someone because they had to wait for their service however you can never assume someone waited patiently
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have work in retail for years been a sales associate to being a assistant manager and currently store manager i literally now hate the public peopleon my days off if i step out of the house and be around public people for more than an hour i start to get annoyed and just go home im sorry to sound so negative but damn there are a lot of entitled people out there those are the people i hate the most when i go to retail store to buy things i dont give the employee a hard time because i am one of them so if you all work in retail please be nice to those employee at your local retailers unless they are a complete asshole for no reason
LifeProTips,not_removed,this doesnt work on me im thinking i am not patient right now it makes me feel like theyre not owning their mistake
LifeProTips,not_removed,replace this with wtf do you want or i dont give a shit how much money you spend here it puts the customer in their place right away they can see that they have little or no leeway
LifeProTips,not_removed,i liked doing this when i waited tables because if they replied with anger they were basically saying but im not patient
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt when shopping be nice to the person helping you and you are more likely to earn extra discounts or get that deal you thought you saw if you are rude i will not change any prices nor apply the weekly coupon
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt to customers be patient workers are people just like you empathize with them as they are also trying their best to get out of this uncomfortable situation fast as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,some of you are right that many customers will not react well no matter what you say some will be patient no matter what but there are some in the middle who will not realize how this positively affects their perspective of the situation further the greatest effect this will have is on you it makes a world of difference saying thank you all day rather than apologizing it doesnt help saying it once or twice try it a week a month if you can see if you can tell a difference in your outlook on the customers go luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,this will probably get buried but i wanted to add my two cents here it really doesnt matter what you say in these situations i find that its far more effective to treat customers especially frustrated ones like individuals be honest with them dont provide any excuses unless asked focus on the solution and not on the problem when someone is upset about waiting for a coffee during a busy day take a second and address them directly and say heres your coffee sirmaam is there anything else i can do for you then provide them with a second of serious attention people dont care about your reasons for the lag and they dont care about your preemptive apology if they show frustration and reference the wait then you apologize and wish them a great day this shows respect it shows willingness to help and it provides them with direct undivided attention you cant fake honesty and empathy you have to show it to them it doesnt matter if you actually care or not see it as a strategy of deescalation and the quickest route towards finishing that interaction and moving on
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use i appreciate your patience everyday thanks begs for a youre welcome good lpt though
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for your patience is a magical phrase it makes the customer feel like he or she is being paid a compliment part of the brain says you know i am a very patient person im glad someone finally noticed
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont say sorry for the wait because im fat and dont want to give any mofo the chance to change it to weight and use it against me customer service face would crumble and wrath would be unleashed and i just dont need that kind of trouble
LifeProTips,not_removed,i find that condescending if you are busy and i hav been waiting dont waste both our time with fluff unless i bring it up which i usually wont unless you personally say ignored me in an empty room
LifeProTips,not_removed,i absolutely hate it when people thank me for giving something i havent given if i havent given you my patience dont thank me in receipt source i work in retail
LifeProTips,not_removed,totally wrong youre presuming the person is being patient when in fact hes been silently cursing you while youve made him wait apologizing for the wait is the least you can do better still offer him something free for his next visit assuming youre lucky enough for him to come back so wrongheaded you are
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont thank me for my patience when you never asked for it seriously fuck you at least apologize for the waittrouble
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a top lpt especially useful idea when working in emergency department or any situation where the customerclientpatient has had to wait for an amount of time that would warrant the comment i find saying thank you for your patience is an assertive appropriate acknowledgement of the wait time that starts and ends in the same sentence without sounding like an invitation for them to launch into a tirade about how long its taken i dont like to say it but in this case apologising for the wait is often seen as a sign of weakness its seen as you acknowledging a problem that needs to be fixed and is thus an invitation for the customer to give you helpful hints or let loose if they are so inclined
LifeProTips,not_removed,couldnt diagree more when i feel wronged i want it acknowledged and i want to be apologized to i dont want to be thanked for being wronged like a pat on the head to a child it wasnt my choice to be patient you put me in a position where i had to be patient i really couldnt disagree more thank you for patience is extremely frustrating to hear this is terrible advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,so many selfish dickheads
LifeProTips,not_removed,honestly i rather quit than deal with impatient snobby people not worth the my state
LifeProTips,not_removed,i stopped saying sorry to customers a few years ago first of all im not sorry secondly whatever is wrong is most likely not my fault anyway so fuck off have a nice day
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt when working retail have a look of absolute i dont give a shit barely concealed followed by an empty platitude because you dont get paid to listen to some fucking soccer mom bitch that her target flip flops wore out after a month
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work in fast food and i guarantee neither i or the customer gives a shit what i say
LifeProTips,not_removed,i swear out of things the frontpage from this subreddit are just dumb as a customer i would much rather hear sorry than thank you in these situations when you say thank you its like implying that i chose to wait if you are going to make me wait extra at least show me that it wasnt your intention and you feel bad about it saying sorry is a way to do that screwing up in a way that affects me and not showing sincere regret about it is just an indication that you will continue to do that and make me less likely to rely on you this is true with companies and with people
LifeProTips,not_removed,itt people you dont want to encounter when working retail
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think the vast majority of people have become so desensitized to soft speak like this that its become all but useless taking a phrase people hear every seconds while waiting on hold on the phone and expecting it to come across as heartfelt and genuine in person isnt realistic heres a lpt if you want to sound heartfelt and genuine use your own honest wording not a precanned phrase someone suggested on the internet
LifeProTips,not_removed,two other tips from a former retail worker okay great is a synonym replacement for fuck you if you roll your eyes really slowly it looks like youre thinking
LifeProTips,not_removed,it works perfectly because when they arent actually being patient you can say it with dripping deadeyed sarcasm and its more of a specific character indictment than a sarcastic apology
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck all the twats who think its condescending in fact fuck all the twats who have a sensitivity to things they find condescending
LifeProTips,not_removed,i much prefer to hear sorry thanks for your patience really pisses me off because it implies that im alright with my time getting wasted id honestly rather hear nothing at all at the point of either of these being appropriate since neither of them are sincere at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,it definitely makes it harder to complain saying thank you while sorry opens a door for complaints thank you for your patience is brushing off my issue and while i wont bitch ill be leaving with a sour taste in my mouth this works good for the worker bad for the business
LifeProTips,not_removed,i appreciate your patience
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to say that too usually sarcastically but it helped even then
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did that a lot when i served i worked at a steakhouse near a baseball and hockey stadium seperate stadiums and so dinner rushes were basically crickets bam sat at once crickets in two hours however i used i appreciate your patience saying i appreciate puts them on a pedestal because theyre doing you a favor by being patient theyre such good customers self pat but if i was going to apologize i would say i apologize instead of im sorry this might be regional but i live in toronto and since yeah we say sorry a lot in canada i apologize is more sincere and personal
LifeProTips,not_removed,rtalesfromretail
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive said i appreciate your patience for a long time because when my coworkers say sorry about your wait my brain likes to hear it as sorry about ypur weight my brain is a smartass its also really fun to tell the least patient people how much you appreciate their patience
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends on how long its been if its really long a sorry would be better
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to wait tables in a midrange american steak house in suburban california most of us averaged just over of sales in tips one of our best waiters however averaged under because he would apologize almost every time he talked to a table in his mind if he felt he shouldve gotten there faster or the drinks or food couldve come out more quickly they deserved an apology even if they were fine andor hadnt noticed problem was it implanted in the customer a feeling that something was subpar even when it wasnt it was a habit hed gotten into that he couldnt break and it cost him thousands each year
LifeProTips,not_removed,interesting this is pretty much word for word although i think that many people have independently figured this out through the years other examples might include matt thank you for giving me a second chance matt thank you for your understanding i am grateful for a friend like you that has been so understanding of my recent shortcomings you can also follow up these suggestions with sincere questions for that individual eg thanks for your patience do you have any suggestions about how to get to this part of town quicker
LifeProTips,not_removed,this also applies to nursing sigh
LifeProTips,not_removed,also works great for call centres
LifeProTips,not_removed,my stock response to all of those platitudes is no worries because seriously minutes in line isnt going to kill me even if it is next to that guy you know the one
LifeProTips,not_removed,and it also makes you sound confident ive found that it works in many situations
LifeProTips,not_removed,also i like to say as it turns out instead of unfortunately
LifeProTips,not_removed,it also helps to add an attention grab hey really thanks for your patience we really appreciate it when were so busy its similar to sorry about the wait were trying but with the positive connotation
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive noticed this helps in my call center job especially when i really mean it its not like i want you to have to be calling in and asking me questions i dont know the answer to when theyre patient it makes me less on edge helping me to work efficiently as possible you people are vicious be respectful and representatives wont get so anxious just giving you the run around or whatever answer you want to hear causing you to call back because they cant think sttaight with you screaming in both their ears just ugh thank you for your patience when you have it it is greatly appreciated
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive always used sorry for the wait and people are usually cool with that im accepting responsibility for their wait time and apologizing for it taking so long
LifeProTips,not_removed,me it helpdesk how can i help you them im not able to log into the website me okay what message is it showing when you try to log in them sir i am not a computer person so i dont know me do you know which web browser youre using them i dont know what that is me okay when you want to go on the internet do you click on a blue e or a multicolored circle or them sir i already told you that i am not a computer person youre refusing to help me so im going to hang up

LifeProTips,not_removed,all you gotta say is i just work here
LifeProTips,not_removed,while it can suck i started a retail job earlier this year and ive gotta say ive changed quite a bit its helped heaps with my issues with talking to people in general
LifeProTips,not_removed,just quit a retail job after years this is the real lpt here
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked retail for a cumulative year and a half which in the grand scheme of things isnt that much and yet almost a year after leaving i still feel like theres a piece of my soul that im never getting back oh well at least i got the hell out of there before it totally destroyed my humanity
LifeProTips,not_removed,go do some manual labor sounds worse but it isnt

LifeProTips,not_removed,i did concrete roofing paintingdrywall motivation for higher education now i work with my brain more than my body it pays more and doesnt hurt as much
LifeProTips,not_removed,as walter white would say youre goddamn right
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was in retail management for years worked at various different business now for the past few years ive shifted career to a cubicle office and never been happier
LifeProTips,not_removed,are you fucking sorry
LifeProTips,not_removed,ihave actually done this pretty much exactly as you did here it was pretty awkward and it made the customer all the more pissed especially when i tried to laugh it off
LifeProTips,not_removed,patience thank you for the damn
LifeProTips,not_removed,as always the real lpt is in the comments
LifeProTips,not_removed,how would i go about chugging a beer in someones face or do you mean that i should throw the can down after i finish and shout in your face edited for autocorrect chicanery

LifeProTips,not_removed,canned wine i love me some canned wine
LifeProTips,not_removed,the real life pro tip is always in the comments
LifeProTips,not_removed,if there is no red wine to be had a pan galactic gargle blaster or a little of the old janx spirit will do just fine
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry is usually the same as i apologize except at a funeral
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,i will never work for another company that makes you use phrases or words when speaking to the customer fuck that it always made me feel like a robot
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank god praise the lrd for their great mercy in allowing i this humble helper dont work in to not be presently engaged with the service industry doing the utmost to make you smile today i this humble helper hate deeply appreciates people treasured customers trying to graciously taking the time to improve micro manage my language the selection of words flapping out of this useless mouth
LifeProTips,not_removed,seriously it gets to a point where you really just have to stand up for yourself and not take it in the ass treat the nice people nicely and the ones going insane not so nicely worked in part time retail all throughout uni and never got canned or complaints for doing so
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would agree other than the fact that some people make careers in retail and standing out as an exceptional employee who is conscientious of things like this increases that persons chances of getting promoted to a less soulsucking role in the company i only worked retail for three months before i was offered an assistant manager position simply because i acted like i actually cared about the job and made a genuine effort to help customers while my colleagues just didnt give a shit and it was obvious to everyone thankfully i was able to find a job that i get a lot more out of than assistant management but for some people thats a viable path
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did years in restaurants and bars saying im sorry i screwed up solved the situation of the time when you take the blame the customer has no where to go but say thats ok
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was hoping id find a comment like this here this is really the truth i work as a cashier at a grocery store where our customers are primarily older and while some of them are sweethearts the ones who get upset about waiting in line for more than minutes during a rush are the ones who will be the least likely to accept any kind of apology the rude customers can be so mean and theres no way to make them happy
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is exactly my experience though occasionally you get the superpolite types who will spend a couple of minutes telling me that theres nothing to worry about theyre definitely not in a rush they can tell were really busy and theyre just so glad someones there to give them a hand i appreciate that but im in trouble if i interrupt you and im in trouble if i let you keep talking too long
LifeProTips,not_removed,my favorite after explaining to an older customer that no we could not run an extension cord across the service desk for her to charge her electric wheel chair though we were willing to let her plug it into an outlet elsewhere in the store but she couldnt do that cause someone would for sure steal it i try to close the conversation by is there anything else i can help you with and a smile to which she yells at me while very slowly driving away in reverse hell no you didnt fucking help me to begin with two managers were at the customer service desk with me and the more senior one just goes man even i would not have been able to stay that calm with that woman ahh retail and old people
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey something i can chime in on it the customer is going to get upset they will do it no matter what but what op suggests works on the people that arent straight up grumps but those who do have to wait i find times out of when i thank people for being patienct they let me know it wasnt a big deal oftened followed by a have a nice day of sorts i usually work drive through window where as when i would say sorry about the wait they tend to have a more yeah you should have apologized feel to them like i said thiugh if someone is going to be upset with you they will do it anyways as those are the people who will no matter what but it makes all the interactions with other customers go smoother which is always a plus
LifeProTips,not_removed,some people are going to be upset either way some people are going to be happy either way its the people in the middle that might be tipped the right way because of this not everyone who is upset will say something mean this phrase can keep someone from going home and writing a nasty review or can bump a tip up a bit ive been a bartender for years positive phrasing is everything yeah this one phrase might not turn everything around but having an entire lexicon in this direction will if youre more positive youre customers will be more positive
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work at a convenient store and were supposed to have two people running the registers we also have a drive thru we also have to clean the parking spots the drive thru spots our pumps make sure the fountain areas are perfect and cooler is clean and stocked while working with one other person in a busy convenient store we also cant have overtime so when one of us leaves to go and try to get our half of the shit cleaned and stocked the other person has to handle the drive thru which is fucking crazy busy at all times and the front registers which both can get backed up very easily people will be assholes no matter what you say to them if they have to wait more than seconds even though they know youre the only one manning the registers with a line of cars in drive through and people in the store they will get pissed off let you know you can be as nice as could be and hand them and theyd still have their fucking piece of shit attitude its bullshit and i hate my life and i want to die
LifeProTips,not_removed,the worst part is lots of times employees get more talks about these bs details than they get about how to actually do their core job
LifeProTips,not_removed,if the wait is long enough thanking them for their patience might piss them off because perhaps youve worn out their patience if its taken a reasonable amount of time fine but if not then an apology is better than a thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,this i worked in a seasonal job selling christmas gear and a customer snapped at me because i told her i couldnt finish her order ahead of the others ahead of her when the next person showed up for their shift i told her i would work on hers skipping my break and she waited the extra minutes took the finished order and then bitched about me while i stood there
LifeProTips,not_removed,same its like theyre reading a script id much prefer a poor frazzled apology than a robotic script
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree no matter the tone at least for me thanks for your patience sounds fake and with sorry for the wait i can reply with its okay it looks like youre busy or i hate computers too or whatever is appropriate and carry on making us both happy of course i also realise im atypical i try to go to places that arent gonna feed me bullshit and that arent going to expect bullshit from me though thats the best way
LifeProTips,not_removed,this as a costumer if someone says to me thank you for your patience after theyve clearly made a mistake my immediate reaction is what patience do i look like ive demonstrated patience here stop thanking me and admit you messed up alternatively if someone starts with sorry we made you wait this was our mistake then all of a sudden the anger melts the natural gut reaction is aw thats ok it wasnt that bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,lets not relate the if you treat people in common circumstances like they do in retail there will not only be a fight there will be thunderdome
LifeProTips,not_removed,are humans this programmable why not just have a robot saying sorry on loop the whole day
LifeProTips,not_removed,will defuse whatever anger they held toward you for the long wait time nope assholes are always going to be assholes no matter what a decent person wont even be mad in the first place they might be irritated at the situation but they wont be mad at the person
LifeProTips,not_removed,i see a lot of myself in you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like to throw a go fuck yourself in there somewhere too just to keep them on their toes
LifeProTips,not_removed,are you fucking sorry
LifeProTips,not_removed,execution of passive aggressiveness displayed to close friends about the situation in the moment the customer will usually apologize to you eh disclaimer i live in canada
LifeProTips,not_removed,its service like that that makes people act like assholes and think csrs are useless douchefucks
LifeProTips,not_removed,please hold the line your call is very important to us
LifeProTips,not_removed,hell no i work at a popularbusy restaurant and i never say sorry for waiting if its my fault sure ill say sorry but if its situational or were slammed on a random night i always say thank you for your patience if you choose to come to our busy restaurant thats on you if you want to complain or hear a sob story ask for my manager dont even try to get on out of me i work my shift to the best of my ability and im not sorry for that at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if its not the servers fault it sounds as if the situations op is describing are more a matter of heavy traffic rather than anyone being at fault
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for your input
LifeProTips,not_removed,you assume its their fault and you focus only on yourself when the server has to focus on many people at the same time have some patience
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i particularly do not like thank you for your patience because its not as if i had a choice and it feels like im being told i shouldnt be upset about the wait as if i have to patient in that scenario an apology at least makes me feel like the other person knows the customer service is lagging
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use this trick a lot something to consider also is that just removing negative language from your speech is a wonderful thing not just for others but for yourself as well i try to find a good mix of being positive and also admitting some fault i like to be less formal also something like thanks for waiting on me things are a bit crazy here right now it is very important that when you say this you make your body language and tone project now its your turn and you have my undivided attention and concern or it means nothing dont say this and then start to rush them or look distracted joke laugh smile take your time as best as you can with them
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree completely i work in tech support and im pretty well liked and i think what really helps me is the fact that im truthful and genuine sometimes crappy stuff happens and people appreciate you being direct and honest with them
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone working retail i dont apologize for your wait because of the time its not my fault im not apologizing for something im not responsible for
LifeProTips,not_removed,if its busy then its not the servers fault someone literally thanking you for sitting patiently like a normal human being isnt condecending
LifeProTips,not_removed,times out of its something out of their hands its usually pretty easy to tell when they are at fault in which case i tip accordingly the big one for me is ignoring my table because theres a huge party that all the servers wants to cash in on
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree completely thank you for your patience is assuming that im being patient rather than just waiting for an opportunity to rip your head off for making me angry
LifeProTips,not_removed,came here to say this if its busy and they have a lot of tables and such then im not angry or annoyed but if i can see them in the kitchen doing nothing and its their fault im waiting so long then no i dont have any patience for them to be thanking me for
LifeProTips,not_removed,neither are offensive on their own its having to wait thats offensive when you apologize to a customer youre giving them permission to be annoyed when you thank them for their patience youre disarming them by giving them credit for doing something positive that moment of disarmament is usually time enough to distract them away from feeling annoyed and to allow them to get what they came for
LifeProTips,not_removed,i say both i am sooo sorry for the wait and then if possible thank you so much for your patience have a wonderful rest of your day something to that effect
LifeProTips,not_removed,the point is to throw you off your game as a customer and force or at least sway you to chill the fuck out and be pleasant back but this was for retail not restaurants when i brought food late because i forgot to punch it in i would just blame the kitchen happened probably times in years and only once did the kitchen actually lose the chit blame the kitchen now its me and the customer against the world instead of each other
LifeProTips,not_removed,came here to say i find it condescending too
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe you are
LifeProTips,not_removed,i definitely say it as condescendingly as possible and i always say ill see what i can do with as much apathy as i can summon telling customers to get fucked in companyapproved ways is practically the only joy of retail
LifeProTips,not_removed,in retail i genuinely do feel bad for a customers wait and appreciate them sticking around and i still say something like thanks for being patience and shortly explains why there was a delay
LifeProTips,not_removed,seriously this is the kind of thing you would hear at some awful corporate training on how to sound like a scripted insincere serverbot
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work in retail and always say thanks for your patience im not apologizing because its not my fault there were a dozen people in line in front of you i get paid to ring things out and dont get paid enough to kiss peoples ass
LifeProTips,not_removed,nope an honest person who worked retail may say you screwed up for coming in during peak hours and deserved to wait but i can help you now
LifeProTips,not_removed,that assumes its always the fault of the person saying the phrase if a shop is overly busy and the workers arent slacking off thanking someone for their patience is the more appropriate thing to say and is going to be the case more often id say
LifeProTips,not_removed,aesopian business speak conflict mediation training makes this stuff flow out of people it exists for manipulating people and outcomes
LifeProTips,not_removed,its a veiled demand its basically saying were very busy as im sure youve noticed please dont be a cunt to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,well then thank you for your patience it is
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually mixed the two to make thanks for waiting seems way less robotic
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup this is my route more simply short wait thank you for your patience long wait im sorry for the inconvenience would you like some bullshit
LifeProTips,not_removed,most people here havent seen good customer experience i guess there should really be a subreddit for professional retail pro tips like these
LifeProTips,not_removed,the thing is almost every time the person who you want to apologize to you couldnt have done a damn thing to decrease your wait time i work in retail and never say sorry for your wait because youre in a store stores get busy not my fault youre free to leave if you feel like youre being treated unfairly
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like the way you put that im not sorry because its not my fault but i do appreciate you not bitching
LifeProTips,not_removed,so you want the server to pretend that they made a mistake just so that they can own it to make you feel better lol get real
LifeProTips,not_removed,its a mistake that they are busy and you had to wait a little bit please
LifeProTips,not_removed,i came in here to say this i would only thank somebody for their patience if they clearly displayed patience outwardly otherwise it feels kind of patronizing they dont really have a choice in the matter many times and oftentimes have a right to voice displeasure with something saying thanks for your patience is presumptuous in that its mitigatingundercutting their right to feel slighted or voice displeasure
LifeProTips,not_removed,geez is this an american thing in canada saying sorry isnt an admission of guilt or you taking responsibility its more of a no hard feelings thing someone bumps into you both of you should say sorry because that means both of you are not hostile towards one another
LifeProTips,not_removed,legit curiosity have you ever worked retail
LifeProTips,not_removed,i mean if you stayed after seeing there was a wait you did choose to wait
LifeProTips,not_removed,trust me every single cashier salesperson call centre rep would love to plainspeak to their customer but idiotic corporate demands you follow scripting if you dont follow the script or refuse to parrot you get negative performance reviews regardless of how much youve actually helped a customer this is one of the biggest reasons why turnover is it frustrates the customer too i worked call centre for an answering service for companies for comcast bastards sunlife financial and for a public utility before i became an analyst management you want to keep your best agentspeople instead of giving them a script and turning them into an ivr teach them why things work better by doing x vs y get them vested in solving problems and actually helping people they will stick around when they feel like a valued knowledgeable resource and not just a manual ivr about to be replaced
LifeProTips,not_removed,on behalf of everyone fuck you
LifeProTips,not_removed,this hit to close to home man okay i apologize do i have permission to connect to your computer them yes please do something me fixes stupid issue them ohhhhhhh well i could have done that thats easy me aghhhhhhhhhhhhh
LifeProTips,not_removed,worked for time warner cable call center and got these calls often of course ill also get the calls like i was in it for years i know what im doing i know something is wrong so cut the bullshit and send me a tech me i understand sir but i just need to make sure youre trying to connect to the right wireless network idk wtf my network name is me its on the bottom of your internet modem theres so much fucking letters and numbers how the hell am i supposed to know which one always gold when they realize theyve been connecting to the wrong network
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats why you first check everything you can on your side before asking the technical question i see you have x subscription with us it looks like its active i will check your modem your modem is connected with us sincd x time and has good value then you ask some questions as easy as possible dont ask right away about error messsge and browser what people hate is to feel stupid so if they cant answer the first two questions you ask thats how they are going to feel
LifeProTips,not_removed,just finished a shift as digital support for a bank me okay when you want to go on the internet do you click on a blue e or a multicolored circle or you have no idea how often i ask this gave up and get them to go on whatismybrowsercom now haha edit cant format apparently
LifeProTips,not_removed,i believe it i dont work in it but we had a client call and ask how to get his email on the computer because he opened it up on his phone
LifeProTips,not_removed,i once had someone call our support line and the problem solved itself during the seconds i was on the phone literally itself i didnt even do anything and customer just said whoa now it works thank you you saved my day couple of days later i got an email from my boss telling i got really good feedback on a ticket i didnt do anything but i didnt have the heart to tell
LifeProTips,not_removed,rtalesfromtechsupport seek help and support of others in the same buisness dont blow your brains out with a shotgun
LifeProTips,not_removed,and im sorry about your shitty chinstrap beard
LifeProTips,not_removed,perfect
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always ask my customers if they would like coke diet coke or dr pecker
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you bring me a chicago dog and a lemon slush with extra rainbow candy you can flat out tell me to go fuck myself and ill still tip percent
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked at sonic for two and a half soulcrushing years there were so many times i envisioned stumbling and throwing a tray of hot foodice cream into somebodys window
LifeProTips,not_removed,i imagine you bringing out a rack of brontosaurus ribs like in the flintstones intro but it doesnt tip the car over because the driver is fat
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i worked at a pizza place a pizza was ordered like this times edit i do want to add though i doubt it that it could be a regional way of ordering pizza that i never encountered
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to enjoy saying jibberish that sounded somewhat like english ie instead of have a happy new year id say habba habba who here or have a great night would be hamma hake nike and seeing if they noticednone of them ever did or at least never commented the tiniest things we used to do to not completely hate our job x
LifeProTips,not_removed,what does that mean
LifeProTips,not_removed,people suck
LifeProTips,not_removed,been in retail years stockholm syndrome has kicked in
LifeProTips,not_removed,finally got out of retail i apparently have labor day off what is this
LifeProTips,not_removed,service industry here to check in its like retail but they decide if you get paid or not
LifeProTips,not_removed,let me go get the manager hell straighten this out go in back room clock out and leave
LifeProTips,not_removed,the scapegoat is over there please speak with him
LifeProTips,not_removed,like i make minimum wage why do you think i pull the strings
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think its a great experience that everyone should have at some point and it certainly helped me develop in many ways after years though and getting stuck in a low tier management position i have severe anxiety just thinking about the job
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a man who was very shy as a kidteenager i think this is more of the effect of entering a workplace where youll be speaking to strangers every day retail helped a bit but what really brought me out of my shell was a few months in doortodoor sales would absolutely never recommend it but man did some personal growth occur in those months take every shitty situation and use it to accumulate more skills and youll go far in life
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hit years tomorrow september and filing my resignation next week
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had over years in retail you dont get your soul back however i am seeing that slowly i am starting to enjoy holidays again christmas was ruined for me for a long time
LifeProTips,not_removed,i mean for me its told me to never trust a white dude with a flat brim hat cus hell steal your shit old asian people hate you black dudes just want the best sale you have and brown people already know the deals and are just testing you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i realized from working at pizza hut that a lot of hispanic people order stuffed crust my boss had said it and i was all dudethats racist af now i tell new employees and the cycle continues to be fair though stuffed crust is pretty awesome
LifeProTips,not_removed,why the fuck would you even believe any of those stereotypes to begin with
LifeProTips,not_removed,my mom worked in a primarily russian neighborhood in retail management so she always had to deal with the worst i could never talk her out of her discrimination she was a sweet woman in general but held russians in very low regard
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my experience doing landscaping that involved moving logs and carrying heavy packs of weed killer through the woods in degree weather was way better than a day stocking shelves at target
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont know i started work at an amazon warehouse this week and scanning packages for hours straight feels like the definition of torture at this point
LifeProTips,not_removed,i spent about nine months rewiring an entire hospitals hvac system by myself it had its ups and its downs but when i start reciting the lyrics to just to keep myself sane its probably not healthy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i didnt mind loading trucks and sorting packages for fedex but i quickly realized why men are so prone to dying earlier in life and dealing with gimp legs and fucked up backs overextended my shoulder and these assholes thought putting me on easy sort would be good enough to heal up because my arm is totally going to heal when im sorting fuck knows how many packages per minute at random size and weight climbing in and out of trucks had my knee fucked for nearly a year after i quit gained a shit ton of weight from the muscle mass i put on working there gained more in fat after i quit and couldnt run for exercise like i did before working there i liked working there far more than most low wage jobs ive worked i wouldnt do it again though i dont know how to take care of my body well enough to compensate for that
LifeProTips,not_removed,as is this comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,if the robots can cook and then cool to acceptable eating standards samples at costco i say go for it its time to pull ourselves out of this minimum wage economy weve been living in for the past or years flipping burgers used to be a part time job for teenagers not a career goal for illiterate adults
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah you like that you fucking retard
LifeProTips,not_removed,you wouldnt download a can
LifeProTips,not_removed,th that was a glass mug
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres not enough salt in the world for her
LifeProTips,not_removed,they also did it to try and stop shitty customers from tearing you a new asshole i used to be a manager in a call center for an american company i live in canada or officially just north of buffalo because saying i work in canada makes you all irrationally angry as if it somehow is going to change how much i can help you in that field customers are shitty assholes that are going to make you cry just to try and get ten dollars off their bill if you give them even a second to think that something is directly your fault youre fucked and they will rip you apart that language is made to make people less angry yes its condescending but if you yell at me after i thank you for being patient it makes you look like an asshole so you wont do it nobody gives a shit if you get mad in your head go for it were the ones trying to help customers as long as they keep their mouth shut and let us do our job without being rude mission accomplished
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work for a software company when i started our head of client services insisted we couldnt say bug when talking clients we couldnt say issue either we werent supposed to use any negative phrasing when discussing problems with our software fortunately as a programmer i dont have to speak to clients often but i felt like a huge jackass whenever i did for instance client calls because of a bug were actively trying to fix a human being would say yeah thats a known issue were working on it no ill call you back when its fixed whoops cant say issue working on it or fixed because those all imply something is wrong instead wed have to say something like yeah we know about that ill call you back when i have an update this made it insanely difficult to help people because there was no way to confirm that yes that behavior youre seeing is indeed not how its supposed to work and we need to fix it the result was this rule got ignored in practice pretty often you just had to make sure you were out of his earshot if you were talking to a client on the phone because hed chastise you for breaking it thankfully he left not long after i started and that inane policy left with him
LifeProTips,not_removed,really thats just good advice for life your job shouldnt have any impact on how you treat people or how you expect to be treated
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive only been in retail months and i already do this one day on my way to work i saw a horrific accident where the car tumbled ended up upside down and the pet dog was thrown from the vehicle i gave no fucking fucks about whatever material possessions people threw temper tantrums over that day literally none its not important im a human being not a fucking soda machine life is more important than instant gratification
LifeProTips,not_removed,same if someone is an arse i just give them their answer then walk off
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive worked in restaurants for years this is my take if a person comes in and has a lousy dining experience because the kitchen fucked up their order im going to take responsibility for it im their server they can see other servers doing the same job as me they only know of one kitchen the entire kitchen staff is one entity to most guests even if it wasnt my fault im still taking responsibility for their overcooked steak people are more likely to come back if they think their server messed up versus the kitchen messing up ive also found that admitting fault even when i wasnt actually at fault led to better tips most people just want to know that you care and are trying to do better but you cant fix the assholes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did years in restaurants and bars saying im sorry i screwed up solved the situation of the time when you take the blame the customer has no where to go but say thats ok i wish more people were like you im at the doctors office the other day they were supposed to send a script to my pharmacy a few weeks ago and they never did when i went back yesterday the girls first response was why didnt you come back sooner yes thank you for somehow making this my fault why didnt you send my script over the first fucking time you said you would its been like hours and im still pissed a simple we got swamped and iwe messed up im sorry would have worked wonders i also enjoy your phrasing i did years in a restaurantlike its a prison i did years up at san quentin
LifeProTips,not_removed,mirrors my experience thank you for your patience has a patronizing undertone
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of the best things i learned working retail was to say thankyou when a customer called or came in to complain assuming they were calm at the time probably wouldnt work on someone who was already aggressive i would say thankyou for bringing this to my attention and allowing me the opportunity to fix the mistake and i genuinely meant it the customer could have just complained to every single person they ever meet about our mistake causing damage to our reputation but instead they came to see me about it i was able to fix it and often go above and beyond their expectations meaning that they are actually more likely to return
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked in a restaurant all throughout college and ive learned there are only two types of old people sweet and friendly and rude assholes by that age youre either happy or miserable about the life youve lived
LifeProTips,not_removed,of the people i met while working at retail chains were regular nice folks the angry at life and all things alive customer is what makes retail one of the worst jobs out there worst part about it was how corporate would enable these types of customers if you didnt dedicate all of your staff to helping this one insane customer and they left some bad feedback you can be sure youd get a call from the district manager about it ops comments really remind me of how corporate views the world they think people can be easily swayed by smiling and saying thank you or giving them rewards points that they dont want people wouldnt hate working retail if things were that simple
LifeProTips,not_removed,always remember those customers come in looking for a fight they had a bad day theyre looking to pay that shit forward and guess what you happen to be the first fucker in the crosshairs who slipped up in the tiniest possible way you cant reason with these folks you just need to get them to shut the hell up and get the hell out of your store theyre getting mad about stupid shit like things that are built into peoples muscle memory i work in food retail thats not a reasonable thing to get upset about i want a turkey bacon ranch with no ranch sorry random customer i accidentally put ranch on your sandwich and were getting it remade well have it out in just a few minutes customer blows the fuck up this is a great way to have me come over and drain any satisfaction you might have gotten from this encounter right out of your fucking brimstone heart sorry sir or mam but fuck you if you think you can berate my employee for accidentally putting ranch on your turkey bacon mother fucking ranch sandwich like theyve already done fucking times in the last three hours and now you have to wait extra minutes bringing the total number of minutes to max i get that employees should be responsible for screw ups but thats my job and not yours i know whats going on i knew that the turkey bacon ranch needed to be remade i was personally overseeing it two minutes before you looked up from your phone and decided your minute wait was long enough despite the fact that you have no concept of how much time has passed because you werent paying any fucking attention to anything or anyone but yourself i know if this is a recurring issue with one or more employees i know what the hell is happening you dont have a fucking clue if you did you probably wouldnt be a patron at a store that makes mistakes all the time so youd know that it was a small likelihood and you happened to draw the short straw today they like to say the customer is always right but my most successful training tactic for someone learning register is to tell them the following you should assume that the customer has no clue what theyre doing and is completely oblivious to things that you would consider obvious assume that theyre doing literally every single thing wrong and do your best to get the order accurately if that means more questions than youre comfortable asking then you need to get over it tldr customers are fucking retarded so if you keep that in the back of your head as a factual condition as opposed to a frustrating and condescending bit of happenstance youll be far less tense at the end of the day also you guys after rereading this i feel like i might have some pent up aggression about my job
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i worked at subway as a teenager i had a lady throw a sandwich at me because it had a little tuna on it then she told me to remake it fuck that lady
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah ive noticed it too not just in retail but i work in customer service centrelink which is australian social security if theyre gonna be mad its gonna happen but people do like being thanked of the people say something like oh thats okay it throws them off sometimes too by starting positively they are less likely to be negative delivery is everything though sincerity is key
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh so youre one of those customers
LifeProTips,not_removed,stop thanking me and admit you messed up more than likely it was the manager who messed up by not scheduling enough people or maybe you came in during a busy time either way that doesnt warrant an apology from the server or cashier if i had a customer like you i wouldnt say thanks for being patient or sorry for the wait i wouldnt acknowledge your anger in any way if youre gonna have that kind of an attitude and insist that anything that goes wrong is my fault i dont really care if you get angry or not
LifeProTips,not_removed,it depends a long line or big complicated order are not the shops mistake would you feel the same if there was just a long line or a customer had a return or some other reason that is not their mistake
LifeProTips,not_removed,youve offered two problems but zero solutions you say not to say thanks or sorry but to express regret i cant think of a statement for regret that isnt sorry i do mean sorry sorry that we didnt have more staff sorry that our system isnt more efficient sorry that everyone came at once i can be sorry that something happened even if its outside of my control im sorry that your dog died im sorry that this tour im guiding is being ruined by rain
LifeProTips,not_removed,what was that oh i said good luck yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree only because it implies that the business did something wrong waiting is not necessarily something wrong to apologize for patience though always a great thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,this brings back such angry memories
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think we have conflicting understanding of what sorry means i dont use sorry exclusively for taking blame i also use it as an expression of regret when i wish the situation were otherwise even if i didnt cause the situation even if theres nothing that couldve been done its more like saying im sorry to hear about that when a friend relays some bad news that they got
LifeProTips,not_removed,as the waiter you are the representative of the establishment to the customer if a busy night translates to bad service the establishment is not wellrun enough to adequately cope sat too many customers at once or made other mistakes you are not personally apologizing necessarily the team as a whole is
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree i worked at a chain and at a small family owned place chain had waits of friggin hours on weekend dinners and family owned had like hour waits for weekend brunch wait times are told when you enter and put your name in so you know what youre getting into what i will say is that at least of the people who waited would not be crazily upset or condescending when i came to greet them yes there were people who were but theres always a shitty minority when dealing with the general public i found it to be a really fun part of the job to make sure that they had a good time while i was taking care of them crack jokes spend a little extra time going through the menu with them if i had the time do little things to make them feel special most of the time itd be alright and for the others that left pissy well whatever your dinnerbrunch sucked but i tried man
LifeProTips,not_removed,extremely well said
LifeProTips,not_removed,devils advocate regarding the coming to my restaurant when its slammed you should expect to wait comment a decent establishment should be able to handle a sudden influx of customers especially if its an expected influx such as a popular restaurant on a friday night sticking with the restaurant example service shouldnt decline because of a busy night but maybe the wait time to sit down will increase which is perfectly fine and should be expected but once you sit down and the service turns to shit because its a busy night well to be quite frank thats a shitty restaurant
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly this is why companies put in place stop words customer came in on a busy night why should you appologize for that and make it seem like you owe them something more
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry doesnt mean that youre personally responsible its just an indication of regret
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup after working several years in a restaurant i know that a long wait can be due to any number of factors the kitchen has to restock the cooks are shorthanded that shift the pos system that servers use to ring in orders is down crazy dinner rushes etc etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think that is the valuable lpt here this is a tip for the server by saying thank you for your patience you are demonstrating an expectation of positive social behaviour in a difficult situation not everyone can be served first we have to wait our turn im currently teaching this to my five year old at the end of the day the server knows hopefully that they did their best even though it may have been tricky and they may have not always succeeded expected reasonable reactions from those they were serving and can walk away confident in their own behaviour whether or not others respond respectfully is out of their hands but behaving with kindness and offering someone else the option to remember to do that allows the server the ability to walk away from that shift detached from the actions of inconsiderate people
LifeProTips,not_removed,saying sorry is not just about admitting fault for example when someones family member passes you say sorry for your loss because you want to express your sympathy and want to share your compassion for the hardship theyve encountered its the same thing when a customer had a long wait or a bad meal or whatever you saying sorry does necessarily mean your admitting that you caused the thing that made the customer upset it can just mean that you see the circumstances the customer is in and you feel sympathy toward that circumstance
LifeProTips,not_removed,tfw i get a customer that complains about the wait time when its on a sunday you could literally pick no better time of day to come in and order dont complain about the wait because you chose to join during rush hour like dude i know things are slightly slower than normal what do you expect when we are getting swamped in the back
LifeProTips,not_removed,from the waitresses ive felt with they generally hate large parties of people they get loud messy and tip terribly
LifeProTips,not_removed,but this is exactly why some people feel like its condescending youre using a particular phrasing not to convey an honest sense of thanks but in an attempt to socially engineer the response that you want thats kind of manipulative
LifeProTips,not_removed,you prefer an apology for the wait
LifeProTips,not_removed,botirl
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a customer in that situation im entirely okay with hello because i can see that there are people that i happened to arrive at the checkout in a freak rush that theres only two overworked cashiers etc i never got people needing to be reassured that they were special i wasnt great at the retail thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think the implication is that heshe is apologizing for anything but rather that they are speaking on behalf of the business stating that the establishment is sorry for making you wait it connotes an understanding that a customers time is valuable thanking someone for their patience on the other hand is based on the assumption that they have been patient it is definitely the thing that corporations tend to train employees to say as a poor attempt to placate impatient customers ultimately either phrase works as long as the person saying it means it or at least appears sincere
LifeProTips,not_removed,well if you could have done that just let me undo it and also go fuck yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had a patient one time who had cut off all four fingers on one hand and while he was calm and cool about it his family was going crazy his daughter was flailing around in the street like a magikarp completely inconsolable and frankly we were more worried about her than him when we got on scene he had already put his fingers on ice and bandaged his hand and stop the bleeding we transported him to the hospital with his daughter who had managed to calm down enough to speak her exact words thats it thats all you guys do i could have driven him
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i used to work for dells tech support i would answer that response by jokingly saying i could put that back the way it was and have you take care if it then followed by a friendly customer service laugh it would always get them to take that back its the small victories
LifeProTips,not_removed,so a question as someone who frequently talks to an it help desk who happens to be a fairly computer literate kinda guy when i call you would you prefer that i tell you all the precautionary steps ive taken i tried restarting ipconfig in cmd uninstallingreinstalling ending pending processes etc or should i just wait and answer the questions as you ask them
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a sysadmin and to be fair i wish the isps would let you pick your own ssid and password if youre renting their wireless routermodem trying to tell someone to connect to instead of and the password is forces people to have to write it down somewhere just have the tech set it up on the install i realize that might take an extra minutes for the user to figure out an ssid and password but at least itll be something they can remember
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt gold how to actually talk to angry frustrated people to get everybody what they want with as little emotional violence as possible why not win
LifeProTips,not_removed,i fix sewing machines for a living and people quite frequently come back a few days after picking up their machine and yell at us for not fixing it when usually they just have it threaded incorrectly typically i give them a im sorry to hear that lets plug it in and take a look ill rethread the machine and typically theyre response is something along the lines of im so stupid or something like that i always say i thread the machines wrong all the time sometimes you just miss a part or it slips its not a big deal if you have any other questions or it gives you more trouble just give us a ring and send them off it always cheers them up because they know a skilled person screws it up sometimes too and that im not acting like theyre stupid or wasting my time ive had people come in calling me a bitch and leaving calling me dear its all about how you say what you say
LifeProTips,not_removed,imho when you call tech support that ship has sailed
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres something ironic about tech support writing cant format apparently
LifeProTips,not_removed,that would work if you had someone on the line who actually knows where to put the url
LifeProTips,not_removed,its so fucking accurate though best thing about this comic
LifeProTips,not_removed,face so beautiful you gotta put it in a frame
LifeProTips,not_removed,never met a chill guy with a chinstrap dudes always seem like they wanna fight
LifeProTips,not_removed,a chinstrap for this thin chap make that fat booty go clap
LifeProTips,not_removed,rmadlads
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre supposed to tip at sonic i didnt know that
LifeProTips,not_removed,you obviously didnt work at the brazzers official pizza place
LifeProTips,not_removed,really ive had orders for a large sausage verbatim plenty of times straight faced and sincerely from all ages

LifeProTips,not_removed,not when you sell a specialty pizza literally called sausage
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you guys not have sausage pizza ive gotten orders for a large pepperoni a large extra cheese and yes a large sausage many times
LifeProTips,not_removed,upright citizens brigade
LifeProTips,not_removed,a person can be smart people are stupid
LifeProTips,not_removed,i havent talked to one person that has worked retail who hasnt had their faith in humanity tarnished you want to see the worst in people just be in a position where youre performing a service for them subconsciously or not some people truly view customer service workers as inferior to them and it makes them turn into assholes working in retail for two and a half years has made me consciously be overly nice to all retail workers people dont realize how far a little mutual respect will go in making the world a better place that being said anybody currently in retail please make it a point to try and have a future career that isnt retail customer service oriented i dont mean that in any sort of disrespectful way im still working at lowes as a loader but nobody deserves to have to deal with the miserable side of the public for the rest of their lives
LifeProTips,not_removed,people what a bunch of bastards
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think theyre worse when they know you cant fight back
LifeProTips,not_removed,i frequent a coffee shop downtown to get my daily espresso fix naturally im familiar with the employees say thank you ect normal im a human and so are you type stuff anyways this one barista is young and chock full of random emotions as she deals with responsible life being young and school and occasionally you can see that her head is wrecked with problems or that shes over it and her eyes will be dead because some customer told her she was complete shit because there was only pumps of mocha instead of the other day she looked upset and i told her to try and have a good day and that it will get better i hope and she leaned over in what seemed like almost tears and said you dont know how much that means to me followed by a short version of how rude some people are god damn i occasionally deal with my own type of crappy people in my line of work mostly literally crazy but i cant imagine being a barista at an always busy coffee shop and dealing with that type of soullessness all day long
LifeProTips,not_removed,reading that felt so good i cant summarize the past years better
LifeProTips,not_removed,what sucks is when customers come in saying hey how are you and then proceeds to say something else or ask you for something before you even get the chance to answer why ask if you dont want the answer one of my biggest pet peeves working in retail
LifeProTips,not_removed,mean people suck ©
LifeProTips,not_removed,not if im your customer
LifeProTips,not_removed,do they then swallow or spit
LifeProTips,not_removed,certainly has
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have done this before the guy was being a real dick so i went in the back to get my manager clocked out and left he saw me in the way out i just said sorry my shift is over and went home
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm i throw service desk under the bus constantly
LifeProTips,not_removed,so very accurate
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked for quite some time and what i got from it is eveyone is the fucking same sometime an old white lady would steal shit min later a black dude later some asian teen thief were the real problem at my job no security so now i just hate everyone equally i dont care anymore about color
LifeProTips,not_removed,its depressing to hear both of you came to this rather prejudiced conclusion its not about ethnicity its about regional demographics i worked at a chocolate store in my local mall id say the population was around white black and other mostly middleclass there were definitely outliers but on average most people were respectful downtoearth and friendly enough we were in a nice area when another store needed an extra hand due to losing employees i ended up filling in for them that was a higher trafficked mall in a shadier area with both high and low income regions nearby with a few exceptions most customers were either upperclass usually white or lowerclass usually black during my four months there around of black people that came in were disruptive aggressive and generally disrespectful around of white people that came in were rich elderly assholes who acted pretentious condescending and basically treated me like a disobedient slave people are people its their environments experiences and upbringings that mold them into who they are thats why you should just judge every person with a blank slate edit typos
LifeProTips,not_removed,had a couple occasions of fighting stance with an old white man at a music shop fun times
LifeProTips,not_removed,because hes black
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to work in the fields picking weeds for hours a day in like degree weather working in retail was much better in my opinion the backpain and heat was horrible
LifeProTips,not_removed,plus at the end of the day doing that it feels really damn good to sit back and have a beer at the end of the day after stocking shelves at target you just want to sit back and slam a large bottle of hard liquor
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like how deg could be in alaska or the sahara all pretty brutal sounding though
LifeProTips,not_removed,can you wear headphones
LifeProTips,not_removed,the key to enjoying manual labor is the sense of accomplishment with an amazon warehouse theres no end its just endless monotony thats not good for the psyche try building something like a house or a bridge totally different
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive done it for a year i wouldve quit long ago if they didnt pay for college
LifeProTips,not_removed,only hours i work at amazon and scan packages for hours straight
LifeProTips,not_removed,what do you mean by rewiring and why did it take you months
LifeProTips,not_removed,well i mean at least you were already in a hospital for the stroke
LifeProTips,not_removed,costco takes good care of their employees the starting wage is higher than the minimum wage of any state in the us
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh wow autocorrect strikes again
LifeProTips,not_removed,it happens
LifeProTips,not_removed,but you cant fix the assholes yep and this applies from the customer side too if the server made a legitimate mistake and apologizestries to fix things no problem shit happens youll get a good tip anyways but when they fuck up and refuse to admitacknowledge things or just blame someone else even if its true but i dont know that then i get pretty angry and will probably reduce the tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,i try to be a good customer but thank you for your patience is condescending patronizing and presumptuous and guaranteed to annoy me much more than waiting my turn would annoy me i dont really need to hear sorry for the wait either come to think of it
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is extremely well put i worked about years in retail there really isnt any lifepro tip except try not to hate your life and everyone positivity can help you have a better day but nothing is going to help grouchy people if they decide to be dicks
LifeProTips,not_removed,grocery business right now is all about osat overall satisfaction customer experience so they come back
LifeProTips,not_removed,we had a customer punch our store supervisor he still shops here i would have banned him for life
LifeProTips,not_removed,corporate is generally a bastion of wankers
LifeProTips,not_removed,corporate likes to put a bandaid on a gushing gnarled wound
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not sure id say people disagree its just that im not a pedantic entitled asshole
LifeProTips,not_removed,med student here this is exactly how it is in the medical world legally doctors can apologize to patients without admitting guilt in other words they are allowed to empathize with patients without implying they as the doctor are responsible for example im sorry your husband died doesnt also mean im the reason he died apologing for a shitty situation is fine it shows empathy
LifeProTips,not_removed,loud nightclub yells over music do you want to dance no what i dont want to dance no i said you look fat in those pants
LifeProTips,not_removed,literally yes but there is a certain type of predator that looks for situations where they can assign blame and becomes verbally abusive hoping to get a discount out of the situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,the comment op specifically stated that they wanted an apology when the server was at fault
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup and they generally sit around for hours and they wind up being your only table for half your shift or more automatic gratuities dont really help if you could have had other tables in the same amount of time and most places dont enforce them if the customer complains about it being automatic unless its a regular customer most servers hate big parties
LifeProTips,not_removed,it just sounds more natural and authentic theyre both just platitudes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would prefer just getting on with it no need to make thigs longer with fluff
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i go to another store and i see theres a rush i usually just walk around until it dies down and every time i get the sorry for the wait line i just say no worries shit happens you were doing what you could im with you i dont get peoples entitlement to feel like their wait should be of any concern to the people behind the register if anything blame the management of the store for not scheduling enough cashiers
LifeProTips,not_removed,furthermore i dont give a shit what you say to me at a register as long as you are efficiently ringing things up and getting me out of that store the two phrases being debated are irrelevant and fully interchangeable to me because all they are is an empty acknowledgement of your awareness that im probably annoyed and already think ive been waiting too long your verbiage isnt going to help the situation i just want to get the hell out of there
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree i think saying sorry for your wait means either we the business are sorry we couldnt accommodate you faster or i empathize with the irritation of having to wait akin to sorry for your loss when you have not personally killed the person it doesnt mean i accept personal blame for this thing that i should have prevented i mean yes some people may hypothetically take it that way but that doesnt mean that you should never express the more commonly understood sentiments
LifeProTips,not_removed,does a spin i am the manager
LifeProTips,not_removed,its me the manager what seems to be the issue
LifeProTips,not_removed,certainly try to live up to your name dont you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i helped a lady that was like this exactly today she wasted an hour of my time trying to reset her password and all i got was oh i could have done this faster myself without verifying who i am yes you could thats how password reset emails work im positive she couldnt go fuck herself without calling the fuck support hotline
LifeProTips,not_removed,hahaha no the fuck you could not have ya lil magikarp thanks for sharing and for doin what ya do do you know if the fingers were reattached
LifeProTips,not_removed,it depends if you tell me what you did in detail it helps most of the time though my clients lie to me ill ask if theyve turned it off and on again and theyll say yes then i restart the machine and suddenly its working again so i do appreciate when people tell me in detail what theyve done so ill be more inclined to believe them but from my experience most clients lie does that make sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,to be fair if you were in it for years and couldnt figure that out you must have been pretty mediocre
LifeProTips,not_removed,a very sweet reminder of our common human frailty even when doing extremely simple things life is beautiful
LifeProTips,not_removed,face so retarded you need to strap a helmet on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,why
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess we could just flat out rob the place instead

LifeProTips,not_removed,i hate people but i like persons
LifeProTips,not_removed,soylent green is people
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work at kroger and my typical customers are on the opposite end of the scale from walmart shoppers theyre so wonderful and can be such a joy what makes me hate my job though is seeing the incompetence of managers and knowing their actions affect customers it kills me to have a nice old ladys day ruined because the oatmeal she was looking for is empty on the shelf and the grocery clerk is having to play butler for a manager instead of stocking shelves and helping people the thing that will make me leave retail and never look back is not the customers its the management
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive worked at home depot the past couple summers as a loaderlot associate so i feel your pain brother at least you get some muscles and a tan right
LifeProTips,not_removed,bastardcoated bastards with bastard filling
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds like someone i used to work at in a coffee shop she was a younger person who wasnt as set up and confident in life so bad confrontations with customers would sometimes spin her into a wreck and she would say the job was soul crushing funny that so many people start their work life in these kinds of jobs maybe it toughens some up but others dont have a thick enough skin to deal with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just got a halfchub reading this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did something different but with a similar effect i used to work at a call center selling cruise packages for a major cruise line company this lady called to make a change to her booking but didnt have any of the necessary information the company required to verify for security reasons she didnt have her booking number her guest loyalty number didnt know which ship she was sailing on or when her sail date was nothing i apologized and informed her that unfortunately i would need to verify at least two pieces of information in order to access her booking if i even found it with the limited information her first and last name only wouldnt cut it for various reasons on top of that she mentioned that she had booked through a travel agency and in case anyone didnt know if anyone books through an agency the information you can get directly through the actual cruise line company is very limited to protect the agencys bottom line ie discrepancies in pricing info between us and their agency etc well she proceeded to berate me over the phone saying that she was at work and wouldnt be able to access her info until she got home and whatever she needed to do was urgent according to her its you can look up my booking with my name i again repeated that due to security purposes i unfortunately would not be able to access her booking even if i were to find it with her very common first and last name she thanked me in a condescending tone and right as i was about to put her through to our customary post call survey she interrupted me with oh youll be putting me through to your survey now right i delightfully said yes definitely then instead of hitting the end call button put her on hold for about minutes before she hung up yeah i could have been fired for that but i hated that job and she deserved it totally worth it
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont forget the lpt youre supposed to say thank god my shift is over
LifeProTips,not_removed,it always threw people off then i replied with i am the manager fun times edit spelling correction thanks rikers
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont work retail but i often get angry people who want the number to my corporate office i always give it to them with a smile or sometimes offer before they can ask after they leave my office i call my boss and tell them what happened angry person gets same answer from my boss and told to have a nice day its a great system
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am a service desk supervisor and the rest of the store does exactly this and we despise you for it

LifeProTips,not_removed,headphones make any job easier
LifeProTips,not_removed,nope
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a great point i get that monotonous feeling when i see an avalanche of packages coming down the chute and i just think jesus its never going to end is it
LifeProTips,not_removed,there were nine hundred control boxes for the entire hvac system that were wired incorrectly in an eight story hospital i had to go find and correct every single one the actual process was fairly quick but it wasnt trivial and usually just finding and accessing the boxes was difficult in its own right because no one believed in writing things on paper
LifeProTips,not_removed,try not to hate your life and everyone rmeirl
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think this type of person would care how you phrase your sentence or what you say at all for that matter
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh so you think not saying sorry will stop them
LifeProTips,not_removed,tell me more about this please i feel like there is a true lpt in your comment somewhere not generally an angry guy but would go to extreme lengths for free stuff or even discounts
LifeProTips,not_removed,just wondering my son worked at chickfila and they always say my pleasure when you ask for something theyre told never to say no problem because its negative its kinda bizarre to hear my pleasure so much when dining there its not natural speak i personally dont give a shit as long as employees are not pulling an attitude its weird that corporate makes rules like this i can say my pleasure and make it sound like fuck you if i felt like it but i dont usually
LifeProTips,not_removed,im positive she couldnt go fuck herself without calling the fuck support hotline this is glorious and im saving it for the day when i gloriously storm out of my retail job never to return again
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is the fuck support hotline and how can i reach it sounds like my only chance beside a hooker now
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes they were very clean cuts i saw him a few weeks later and he was doing pretty good considering having cut his fingers off
LifeProTips,not_removed,it depends what support you are through top as well some support lines are it techs and others are just running through a script and have no idea how to deviate from it
LifeProTips,not_removed,that may be but so was my grandfather he retired in the late so anything with a modern gui might as well be a foreign language to him but he can do anything in a dos or unix command prompt
LifeProTips,not_removed,they were in itkey word lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,i told you im not a tech person and youre not trying to help
LifeProTips,not_removed,i never tip at sonic either o i always thought of it as any other fast food restaurant but with better tasting food the sonic i go to mostly they dont wear skates they just walk your food out

LifeProTips,not_removed,people make ice cream though
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres always an arquillian battle cruiser or a corillian death ray or an intergalactic plague that is about to wipe out all life on this miserable little planet and the only way these people can get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it

LifeProTips,not_removed,at my work theres always that one manager who makes everything annoying and more difficult and unfortunately hes the one thats over my department managers on a power trip make everything so much worse it doesnt help knowing that this particular manager got moved from his last store to the one in my town because he forgot to check the cardboard compactor and a homeless guy got crushed needless to say its hard to accept his authority knowing that edit the more responses i get the more i think the cardboard compactor thing was just an urban legend still that manager is incompetent as fuck
LifeProTips,not_removed,lady people arent chocolates
LifeProTips,not_removed,everyone is missing the point its not the customers its the management which most have slaved years to get into their position and are discontent with life

LifeProTips,not_removed,you clearly werent a manager at a library edit you ninja editing bastard dude spelled through instead of threw typical management material
LifeProTips,not_removed,what would you tell them when they asked to speak to your manager
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was a manager for a few years a sears and i learned to never throw another employee under the bus it ruins their moral and makes my job much harder in the long run if i was overruling another staff member in front of a customer i would always tell the customer so that the staff could hear that the staff member followed proper procedure but as a manager i can do such and such for you as a customer service if absolutely necessary i would pull out the we succeed or fail as a company and im sorry that we failed you about whatever doesnt cost me anything and is way better than that employee calling in sick tomorrow edit wording
LifeProTips,not_removed,i get along pretty well with the service desk at my job and have covered that position multiple times i know it sucks to deal with angry people but thats basically why our service desk exists
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey you make more than i do for a reason

LifeProTips,not_removed,paper kills trees bro
LifeProTips,not_removed,these demonstrators are required to work parttime for hour shifts and they receive no benefits their pay starts at roughly nearly half of what the average costco workers make and can be increased by per year httpgroundswellorgtheemployeepolicyatcostcopeopledonttalkabout theyre still higher than minimum wage but dont receive benefits of full time workers
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think ive ever used that phrase in a non sarcastic manner as opposed to no problem which ive only used in a friendly way
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked in a retail environment where we were supposed to say my pleasure but it wasnt enforced however saying no problem was a huge nono of course its not a problem this is a paying customer who helps you get a paycheck blah blah blah etc that being said its engraved in my brain to never utter the words no problem
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually said no problem when working in retail i just said what felt natural
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hate hearing them say my pleasure constantly it gets to be annoying because you know its required and disingenuous
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hate that kind of corporatespeak its like some executive somewhere read a dale carnegie book and got a bee in their bonnet about positive language so now everyone has to sound kind of creepy
LifeProTips,not_removed,my pleasure isnt natural speak people say that all the time here in atlanta or just pleasure i do find gerne unnatural as opposed to bitte or bitteschön however
LifeProTips,not_removed,omg i thought i would never see you again how was fat camp
LifeProTips,not_removed,your comment is literally more thanks than the past hours of phone calls and product support combined for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,im positive you couldnt fuck yourself with a support wait i meant i need a hotline fuck it i quit
LifeProTips,not_removed,its a hotline for when you need to go fuck yourself but cant because youre too incompetent you call the support line to have someone walk you through fucking yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,manager why isnt this ticket classified correctly
LifeProTips,not_removed,and no one knows that youre paid server wages so you dont get tipped as often as you should
LifeProTips,not_removed,what state are you in
LifeProTips,not_removed,i remember cent corndog day never again
LifeProTips,not_removed,ugh half priced shakes i somewhat enjoyed working at sonic until they introduced that made every summer a living hell for the last four hours every night
LifeProTips,not_removed,are they gone still a thing where i live
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel terrible now i had no idea sonic workers were tipped i go to the sonic next to me occasionally their food is terribly over priced and all the employee needs to do is rollerskate five feet give me my meal and ill leave the only explanation for having tipped employees at sonic that i can see is to just make even more money for those at the top fuck sonic ill boycott it
LifeProTips,not_removed,pizza delivery for ic wiener
LifeProTips,not_removed,i mean thats the whole point from my understanding
LifeProTips,not_removed,this guy has a point
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats why people are good
LifeProTips,not_removed,damn that was on final jeopardy last night
LifeProTips,not_removed,true can confirm i work as a receptionist at a hotel in buenos aires argentina and american tourist love yo complain about anything just yo get discounts but guess what ir doesnt work here employees have very strong labour rights so its hard to get fired cost a lot of money to the employer so i can tell them to fuck off politely and expect no retailation from my employer but seriusely americans are a nightmare sometimes
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents are the kind of people who get angry when something goes wrong like waiting an abnormally long amount of time in a restaurant but as i become more of an adult i find being nice and understanding makes people more willing to go the extra mile to make up for the mistake plus i just really cant be rude to someone unless theyre a genuine cunt
LifeProTips,not_removed,zed we got a bug
LifeProTips,not_removed,not quite if we thought the earth was flat years ago why does atlas hold a globe
LifeProTips,not_removed,homeless guy got crushed da fuck whywould a homeless guy sleep in a baler and why was the baler in a position where homeless guys could get to it unless you can provide some kind of news article about this im not going to be inclined to believe it homeless guy would have had to been deaf to not hear the machine turn on and start screaming that he was in there and those things crush really slowly
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha forgot to mention the multiple manager concept in my reply good call i essentially report to seven people
LifeProTips,not_removed,not sure where you work most of my managers have less than a year of actual retail experience i wish i were joking and yeah its mostly them a heck of a lot of corporate and definitely a decent amount of shitty customers too a lot goes into exactly why retail is hell
LifeProTips,not_removed,im single bitch
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked at a grocery store and the manager that made all the signs and schedules could not spell for shit i always felt embarrassed whenever she would leave a misspelled sign up that customers could see
LifeProTips,not_removed,give them a phone number for some shitty corporate office that will get back to them in business days
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wish the assistant managers would do this i dont know how many times i tell a customer that its against store policy to take something back get the manager because the customer is mad and they cave instantly
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wish my managers at the walmart i used to work at would do this wed always be like sorry but we cannot do this because yadda yadda return policy yadda yadda you cant return meat you bought a week ago yadda yadda this isnt the original disc that came in the case yadda yadda and of course the managers would give them exactly what they wanted usually give them a gift card for their troubles and just allow the customers to think that were idiots who dont know what were doing so many customers would have that justified attitude and would be like yea i told you i could get a refund on that
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh i understand and we are definitely here to take care of the customer we just have quite a few associates who pass off issues when they can easily solve it themselves
LifeProTips,not_removed,where i work service desk and regular cashiers make the same
LifeProTips,not_removed,tushie
LifeProTips,not_removed,only if its free
LifeProTips,not_removed,donkey
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant imagine a customer caring at all but thats just me i guess theres folks out there that would be that petty
LifeProTips,not_removed,have a pity upvote i feel your pain
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait what i had a friend who said she made minimum wage when she worked at sonic maybe it varies from state to state
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive only been to sonic twice ever but i had no idea ive never thought to tip for fast food
LifeProTips,not_removed,servers in louisiana get paid nowhere near
LifeProTips,not_removed,alright slick but let me tell you something about your skillz as of right now they mean exactly dick
LifeProTips,not_removed,employees have very strong labour rights so its hard to get fired cost a lot of money to the employer im so happy to read this but the poor americans are fucked imagine working for their employer
LifeProTips,not_removed,we have this saying the customer is always right the thing is the customer is almost never right who knows more about this place more than the person who spends hours a week there then some jackass walks in and knows something is wrong after minutes shove off
LifeProTips,not_removed,hate to say it but i kinda agree maybe if it was really full there wouldnt be much to do the cardboard would muffle him a bit and crush him sooner than if there wasnt much but like i imagine throwing that much cardboard onto a person will wake them up anyway plus again how on earth did he even get in no homeless person could get to any cardboard baler ive ever encountered unless there was absolutely nobody around for them to run into the back room find it and climb in im not going to say its completely impossible but like literally everything has to go as wrong as possible
LifeProTips,not_removed,and then the customer turns to the employee with that smug ass look on their face you know the one you want to punch off of them
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive learned which managers will side with the employee and which ones will cave instantly always call for the ones with a spine first
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work in a call center and theres literally nothing i hate more than that shit actually its probably not true but whatever after a while though i just stopped giving a shit and now i give the customers what they want as long as i feel it still benefits the company i work for so far i havent received any complaint from corporate so i keep doing it makes my life and my customers life easier as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,we also generally hate you guys because in my store you inconvenience us all the time to ask questions literally one google search would give you the answer to and then you could help that customer finish their day faster which is what they want they dont want to have to wait for someone to come up then reexplain their problem again then wait for me to hopefully figure out a solution if im going to google the answer in front of both of you do it yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,target because thats how it is there and it sucked
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow that really sucks im sorry to hear that
LifeProTips,not_removed,radiolab did a great episode on amazon and how they exploit their workers and treat them like shit it really should be required listening for all amazonians i really suggest you check it out not only is the show itself awesome and really well put together and entertaining but its actually a very informative episode and might actually help you in the future by teachingwarning you of some of the crap that amazon pulls on its employees on the regular
LifeProTips,not_removed,sweet not sure how much you usually charge
LifeProTips,not_removed,people bring this up in most states or all i really dont know edit all states its federal law if you dont make enough in tips to be min wage your employer pays the difference its also shitty to have a fast food company with no indication especially when paying card that the workers are paid in tips for a job no other fast food restaurant does tips sonic should just pay everyone flat min wage and allow tips if customers feel inclined to do so fast food is expensive as it is sonics food is cheap even for fast food and with tips i might as well go to a better place i like their drinks and dogs but corporate can go fuck themselves for trying to maintain an oboslete fast food model
LifeProTips,not_removed,it varies from sonic to sonic the one i worked at i got still less than minimum but just by a little bit
LifeProTips,not_removed,if theyre franchised and they likely are that might be the cause for the discrepancy
LifeProTips,not_removed,they have drive thru but they also have the little pull up order thingie where they bring your food out on roller skates first time i went was in another state before they expanded to michigan i just straight up asked if people tip she said its not required at all but accepted and appreciated so i tipped like on my or order because i was kind of embarrassed for having to ask but she was nice about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,ya that carhop gets carhops here only get the point is they get less than minimum wage because theyre supposed to be tipped and thats supposed to make up for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,the customer is always right is a phrase that we know here too but for me that phrase is submision and a bit kind of sadic that phrase is somewhere near prostitution of your labor time actualy isnt that phrase very convenient for a pimp to his whore we are not whores we are workers
LifeProTips,not_removed,at cvs ours was outside but could only be accessed inside through a heavy door and a short chute connected to the baler we had someone possibly briefly living around the baler which is weird little shade and cover and someone using that fenced in area to drink but there is no way they could easily get into the baler itself someone probably made up that story to talk shit on that manager typical high school rumor bullshit thats way too common in retail people can be so petty
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if we assume it was a junkie hobo either fucked up on heroin or in a crash coma after a meth bender in either case youre not gonna wake that fucker up easily and even if hes conscious he might not necessarily give too much of a shit about being compacted
LifeProTips,not_removed,idk i work both guest service and cashiering and i far prefer guest service
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for your patience
LifeProTips,not_removed,federal law says those employees on tip wages must be paid to meet minimum wage if their hourlytips dont meet minimum wage
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you dont make enough in tips to be min wage your employer pays the difference the problem with this law is in order for it to apply you have to report your tips on your taxes all my server friends love to bitch about i dont even make minimum wage but none of them like to mention the fact that if they throw on some lipstick and act extra flirty during a friday night rush they can bring home of untaxed income and most if not all of them know about this law
LifeProTips,not_removed,but they might as well pay minimum wage anyway since if they dont make minimum in tips the employer has to pay the rest
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry for the trouble
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont feel responsible for how your family behaves its not your fault at all and you neednt bother yourself with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,for a quick change of mood just smile the actual position of your facial muscles in a smile gets stress hormones under control
LifeProTips,not_removed,happiness is a conscious decision not an automatic reaction
LifeProTips,not_removed,remove yourself from the situation emotionally imagine you are watching these people on tv they cant affect you you cant affect them all you can do is sit back and laugh at their ridiculous behavior
LifeProTips,not_removed,the first thing that came to my mind wasdont drink or at least dont get drunk so many potential messups can be avoided that way
LifeProTips,not_removed,we can not choose family need to look at as they are and not get angry because there is no point we can not change anythingsmile and paste
LifeProTips,not_removed,hello uelevengallonhat thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons this would be better off in rrelationships if you would like to appeal this decision httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetorlifeprotips alternatively you can resubmit using httpwwwredditcomrlifeprotipssubmitresubmittrue make sure you rlifeprotipsaboutsidebar before submitting thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow tough situation quite an emotional crucible there no wonder you are overwhelmed i am going to offer you a way to reframe how you view things that might help you get through the remaining days here goes perhaps part of your emotional stance is that you because they are family expect them to be working to make you happy well in a wellbalanced family people do expect this from each other they try to reciprocally make each other happy to a reasonable degree whatever that is which may vary from family to family culture to culture my point being that your expectation is normal normal normal normal in my opinion anyway so do not be mad at yourself for expecting this but the lottery did not land you with normal you landed in a family of people who cannot manage such reciprocity at least not at this stage in your life and even healthy families have difficulties at weddings with expectation piled upon expectation still the love and hope are there as you are apparently all at least showing up for the event but for now if you can let go of your expectation that they will try to satisfy your emotional needs and if you can free yourself of the expectation that you will be able to satisfy theirs a whole level of stress can be shed for example once you reframe the situation this way you can now react to your parents statement that i want my children to be happy by thinking only this oh my parents have a wish that is good to know lots of people have wishes now back to this delicious foodnice conversation at this table through this new prism of thought you are free to not carry your parents comments around like a wound because you have generously released them from the job of trying to satisfy your emotional needs and you have released yourself from the nagging feeling if you have it that you should have done better to make them happy in some way because you have generously released yourself from having to satisfy their emotional needs when family members make careless or attentiongetting loaded comments which based on your description of your parents i assume they will like elevengallonhat could never tell a joke or elevengallonhat never visits guess what now through your new frame you can just hear it as their random view not as a poison dart that you must defend yourself against yes this will take some practice this week is a great time to get that practice it can feel like shedding an old skin if you can manage this leave this week feeling refreshed and renewed ha ok now i am just being silly anyway that is my stab at things best of luck through the week
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you i keep reminding myself that i dont have to be here that im an adult who can make my own decisions in everyday life and there are no more family weddings after this maybe part of it is realizing that the next time my family will all be together like this it could be for my dads funeral feeling that i may never reconcile my family issues as id like might be stressing me further like a trigger in reverse im does this sort of thing ever go away
LifeProTips,not_removed,smiling right now reading your comment thank you for the reminder
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is gospel truth right here i had a job this year that would have tried the patience of a saint the cattiness backbiting fakeness and assorted other bs was absolutely miserable one day a colleague who wasnt that bad actually pulled me aside and said you look like youd rather be anywhere on planet earth other than here and in my mind i was like ummm yeah sounds accurate lol but i realized that it was giving joy and satisfaction to my tormentors so i decided to paste a smile on my face just to avoid giving those expletive redacteds the satisfaction of seeing me sweat i noticed that my mood improved dramatically after a few minutes of even fake smiling i also repeated to myself mentally that this situation is not ideal but i choose to feel happy anyway while i find a way out of here it really helped me was my job still a toxic environment without question i felt like a had a suit of armor on though no matter how bad the job was it couldnt steal my joy it all started with the fake smile embrace the fake smile it soon turns into a real one
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont disagree with you would you mind explaining your insights a bit further thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,right yes perspective remove myself from the storyline this is always so hard to do when the story gets tense and i feel under pressure as the protagonist i wish i could turn off the tv sometimes but the reality is were all a bunch of monkeys hurdling through spacial infinity on a big wet cosmic bowling ball and nobody ultimately has any idea why or what to do about it there is humor in this and i should take comfort in it it is ridiculous and my petty dramas even more so thank you so much
LifeProTips,not_removed,a thousand times yes to this advice thank you ill have a marijuana to help me relax at the end of the day booze makes me flat out depressed rather quickly much more fun to just watch everyone else get tossed and have a laugh about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,truth thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry for your loss hope you can get through the next days and months with continued support
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and feelings my heart is open to them and you and youve helped me immensely by offering your personal insight from a very personal situation im so sorry for your loss and i respect where youre coming from be open take breaks and ask people for lots of favors and input its so hard to ask help from people and thank you for reminding me that its necessary im the youngest in my family and my parents used to argue through me as a kid so ive grown up with a dont do that to people the way they did that to me attitude which makes things difficult and forces a lot of emotions inwarddownward its good to be receptive with reasonable boundaries in place hope you had a great walk with the pupperoni cheers to you and yours
LifeProTips,not_removed,i respectfully disagree with you and await your response to the private message i sent to youthe mods thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for this breath of fresh air there is so much helpful advice and feedback here ive saved your post and will continue to digest this over the next several days off to go shed my old skin
LifeProTips,not_removed,however they act that doesnt give people a bad impresion about you
LifeProTips,not_removed,totally im so glad you had that epiphany sounds like it was a major turning point towards contentment and lightness looking at life as a big game helps me put a smile on i dont have to take it so seriously blackbritish comedy helps with this easier thought of than done but when i can manage to find the ironic humor in thingseven awful situationsi tend to ease up were all gonna be worm food one day anyway may as well enjoy slurping through the soil
LifeProTips,not_removed,it manifests itself a bit differently with everyone really for me its a matter of reminding myself that certain things dont really matter for example your father begins ranting about trump being the second coming of jesus take a deep breath and shrug it off it doesnt really matter theres nothing you can do to stop it and theres no point in addressing it your mother begins having an episode well really you knew this would happen might as well refill your drink while that works itself out your parents get into a loud horrendous argument while youre trying to recharge after a day of dealing with people well it was about time to go buy a magazine from the corner store anyway just like little kids theyll tucker themselves out eventually its really a skill you have to practice and develop but you quickly come to realize that the negativity your mind reaches for out of habit isnt helpfulafter the first couple of times you catch yourself and go no no thats not productive it becomes a bit easier
LifeProTips,not_removed,so glad to hear back from you best of luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you i tend to agree its really my reactions to their actions that make me feel bad especially when other people just find their behavior amusing and im stewing like a korean hotpot i used to get actively visibly enraged at my mom because of the way she treats people very selfish and demanding and curt dismissive inconsiderate and disrespectful i felt personally embarrassed because of her behavior watching other people try to meet her halfway confounded at how my own mother could be so detached from decent human interactions ive learned to relax about that a lot these days i try to simply observe the situation whenever it presents itself refusing to imply myself as part and parcel to her actions my problem is that the embarrassment sort of calcified into suppressed anger over the years which then transformed into a sort of morbid depression i think its my crappy nofun dragdown sort of attitude in public that makes me feel selfconscious around other merrymakers its like i want to enjoy my pissiness but not at the expense of others joy the more i realize im connected to everything around me the less just i feel in spoiling the general mood shutting down closes everything off in multiple directions i need to open up to new possibilities altogether and remember that whatever happened before doesnt have to determine how i act now contentedness is a conscious choice happiness even more so
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for extrapolating this is so helpful to read youre right certain things do not matter and part of the art of living life well is in knowing what to overlook people will be people anywhere i go how i choose to consciously respond to a situation will have a much bigger impact on my experience than simply relying on past experiences and lessons learned even if those lessons served me at the time growing up means opening up in light of my troubles and not shutting down under duress shit is hard when it comes to longterm family stress but this is the ultimate training ground for practicing compassion nonattachment and productive coping skills the negativity your mind reaches for out of habit isnt helpful priceless every choice that ive given up to guardian angerthank you for the reminder truly i hope you have a spectacularday ocelots rule
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel the same about my mom the thing is that it drives us crazy because we spent time with that type of attitude but for people who get to see that rarely its amusing thats why it makes us feel peety only a parent can be ashamed of his childs actions not viceversa so chin up and enjoy the wedding
LifeProTips,not_removed,cheers friend i empathize with you thanks again for the kind words
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats actually pretty brilliant
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks man
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think so i hope not anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,but how else will i know what to like and subscribe
LifeProTips,not_removed,is it possible to do this on their mobile app
LifeProTips,not_removed,hello utufflaw thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons product or service recommendations for their intended use if you would like to appeal this decision httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetorlifeprotips do not repost without explicit permission from the moderators make sure you rlifeprotipsaboutsidebar before submitting thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wasnt aware the annotations showed up on mobile but its on the account level so it should work for the entire account no matter which platform you use
LifeProTips,not_removed,they dont show on mobile
LifeProTips,not_removed,so the lower i set the bar the happier ill be sadly i agree
LifeProTips,not_removed,can i start tomorrow though
LifeProTips,not_removed,why does unemployed equal lazy i feel like everyone who upvoted this didnt read your actual text
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wouldnt say set it low but like anything baby steps lead to long distance and better conditioning if you want to be a ceo you have to clean the fryers at some point you know what i mean
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends if you want to improve your qol right now or tomorrow
LifeProTips,not_removed,op doesnt imply unemployed lazy the post said if youre unemployed and lazy
LifeProTips,not_removed,not if you get a small loan of a million dollars
LifeProTips,not_removed,can i do next week then i gotta lot of things to do tomorrow
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly this there is circumstances and not everyone who is unemployed is lazy i was referring to my experience mostly and hoping it could hit a lightbulb in a few heads
LifeProTips,not_removed,deal but if you get those things done tomorrow than your actually following the tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh shit you just blew my mind
LifeProTips,not_removed,great going business with you friend dont forget to start saving early to take advantage of the magic of compounding interest
LifeProTips,not_removed,and you dont forget to keep being amazing
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,that was cute to read
LifeProTips,not_removed,or write in google docs it autosaves your work history which you can access to see minute by minute changes if needed this is helpful as a plagiarism defense andor if you have revisionediting secondguesses over time source im an english teacher who uses it with my students
LifeProTips,not_removed,its good practice even without the plagiarism issue it has saved my bacon in business writing numerous times all it takes is one accidental huge cut and then other edits that exhaust the buffer to make you lose a lot of your documents content this can happen when youre moving stuff around and someone calls you and you forget to paste before cutting something else and bam chapter is gooone saving versions i use naming convention and so on until final allows you to roll back even past the limit of recent undo features in your software
LifeProTips,not_removed,every time i make a major change like moving a section around or cutting a paragraph i duplicate the file and make the change on the duplicate keeping printed copies from every other day or every few days is also important to protect yourself from data loss edit even jesus saves and backs up his files
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont see how that would help defend against plagiarism the drafts could be plagiarized just like the final product
LifeProTips,not_removed,setup a separate google mail account and cc it into all your copies you send out of your work
LifeProTips,not_removed,am i missing something is it not common for americans to use in text referencing systems such as apa at uni
LifeProTips,not_removed,i tend to write schollarly papers in latex so i stay within the prescribed style guidelines with this format i can use github effectively to track revisions
LifeProTips,not_removed,use screen recording software hit record and type away somebody can then see each change to the next as you revise each sentence to the final result
LifeProTips,not_removed,even better learn and use subversion while writing great way to keep history and even roll back to previous revisions if you need to
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats because the drafts show the development of critical thinking and the revision progress
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is so simple and yet so amazing i cant believe that i never thought of this
LifeProTips,not_removed,the version i read is that you have the haircut just before renewing your driver license so that the license photo is of your cut and always with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,my favorite lpts are always the simple ones i feel i should already know but dont
LifeProTips,not_removed,this lpt cuts straight to the point
LifeProTips,not_removed,to be honest i dont know why the barbershops dont do this themselves they already have a client database and they look you up by phone number etc when you come in or call ahead or make an appointment seems strange that they dont just integrate this directly by snapping a few shots of each client after they got their haircut
LifeProTips,not_removed,i also go into the salon with pictures of people who have the haircut i want plus people who have a similar haircut i do not want my usual haircut is an asymmetrical bob and unless told otherwise some stylists will give me i want to talk to your manager hair
LifeProTips,not_removed,the place i go to like keeps notes on what you asked for last time

LifeProTips,not_removed,if you use gmail just add receipts to the address when sending them create a rule and have them automatically filed in a separate folder
LifeProTips,not_removed,receipts are the only item i keep in the cash part of my wallet it makes it easy to just put it in there while in the store so it doesnt get lost in transit or elswhere when my wallet gets too thick with receipts ill sit down and go through them and keep whatever ones are important
LifeProTips,not_removed,download genius scan app works wonders for purposes such as this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use a small coupon organizer and keep receipts from different stores in separate sections and then go through them once every months and throw away the receipts that expired and can no longer be used for returns
LifeProTips,not_removed,use workflow app to create a macro mine is set up to push one button on my phone the camera pops upi take pic of receipt and it automatically goes to a folder on my dropbox account
LifeProTips,not_removed,this only works for rectangular tables though conversations too hard across a round table
LifeProTips,not_removed,why would you do it any differently
LifeProTips,not_removed,instructions unclear tried to sit across from myself and tore the seam out of the arse of my pants but aside from the humor this can be a bad life pro tip at times community luncheons like this are a great way to make new connections and engage with people that you might not be close friends with its a chance to open up your social horizon a bit and people that take advantage of that chance might do stuff like impress bosses or have interesting conversations that they didnt expect sometimes it actually pays to be a bit courageous and actually mingle
LifeProTips,not_removed,but its sort of a mixed blessing because food fights can be awesome at those
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres the school of thought that you should sit beside the people youre comfortable with so theyll be nice and close
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive tried all the free ones and even paid ones ill come clean to you you dont need a to do app the regular ios one works perfect instead i suggest looking at rgetdisciplined rgetmotivated rdecidingtodobetter it looks like youre trying to make a change through external aids while the real change will come from within by all means browse around at different apps but you might just end up wasting more time
LifeProTips,not_removed,have you tried trello you can set up three lists to do doing and done and move your tasks around as youre completing them which i find pretty motivating i think you can also set due dates and notifications for them as well plus it has a desktop site as well so you can work from multiple devices
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks for the great reply thats some pretty deep stuff manor woman on a side note whats the regular ios one are you talking about the calendar app
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey thanks for the nice reply ive looked into trello and will definitely be using it as my agenda once school starts
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think hes referring to the reminders app i use it and it works for the same purpose as you said
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just hang on to the hope that if i stay perfectly still hunched over in some awkward position for hours i can avoid vomiting altogether and doing anything the jeopardizes this plan is out of the question
LifeProTips,not_removed,this may sound weird but sometimes drinking water induces the feeling like i need to vomit especially if its a cold glass first thing in the morning
LifeProTips,not_removed,and try to stand up if possible over the kitchen sink with garbage disposal rather than bent over the toilet rather than kink up the exit route standing up over a kitchen sink with disposal gets the momentum going for a more expedient projection and bonus no face in a urine smelling toilet unless that odor helps you heave and get the job done
LifeProTips,not_removed,assuming youre taking about non alcoholic vomiting then agree otherwise todd quit being a ninny and drink through it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think this is necessarily true right before you vomit your mouth produces a lot of saliva to protect your teeth from the bile adding water for me mimics this influx of saliva and induces vomiting something dry like crackers soaks up the saliva and confuses my body into thinking i dont need to throw up
LifeProTips,not_removed,drink coconut water it will raise the ph level in your stomach to lessen the throat burning and also tone down the puke breath this has been a game changer for dealing with the flu along with my flu box which is a box prepared with items ill need when im sick being single necessitates this
LifeProTips,not_removed,explaining this to people that drank too much will also be very helpful most of the time if you say this will keep you from puking or make it easier they dont fight you taking care of them as much
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually induce vomiting if its because ive been drinking your body says get it out so get it out youll feel so much better after
LifeProTips,not_removed,up and koolaid
LifeProTips,not_removed,orange juice is one of the few things that tastes the same going down and coming up
LifeProTips,not_removed,breaking character here for an actual lpt to go with ops since i have horrible gi and stomach problems and experience this multiple times a day do not brush your teeth right after throwing up rinse your mouth with water and wait about min to brush the acid from your stomach causes a reaction with your tooth enamel and brushing while it is weakened will cause further damage to your teeth rinsing with water to remove all the acid then giving your teeth time to recover before brushing will prevent further damage
LifeProTips,not_removed,try spitting source nurses who regularly have to clean up bloodvomitpoomucus etc whilst remaining professional and not adding to the mess
LifeProTips,not_removed,try milk even better feeling
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just stick my finger down my throat makes the process quick simple and refreshing afterwards
LifeProTips,not_removed,not unless your stomach and esophagus is already spasming in anticipation of vomiting then drinking water will be extremely painful
LifeProTips,not_removed,that and a swig of antacid will help stop the burn and wear on your teeth
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i know its inevitable i like to drink coke it dilutes and also seems to neutralize the stomach acid so it doesnt burn or taste as bad also the carbonation gets things going and over with faster
LifeProTips,not_removed,mint tea is even better anything with mint helps settle your stomach
LifeProTips,not_removed,this one time i had a stomach flu that made me dry heave for like a day straight no idea why i didnt just drink water that shit is incredibly painful thanks op
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive found that sucking on a slice of fresh lime helps stave off the hurling its just a coincidence they happened to be laying around whenever the sudden need to yack musters itself
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always just suffer through it but what has helped me the most in the past is to lay down with a cold wet cloth on my forehead and then put my hands lightly on my stomach keeping it warm this works almost every time
LifeProTips,not_removed,story time my chemistry teacher has a rule if you eat drink water or chew gum in her class you either bring candies for every classmate the next class or you are noted with a big f so one day i felt like vomiting in her class and i started to take a little bit of water i didnt vomit tho i just had that taste in my mouth and the teacher saw me even thought i explained her that i had to drink because i was almost vomiting but she didnt care and guess who had to bring candies
LifeProTips,not_removed,i do this but i use vanilla milk shakes instead of water seriously
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who vomits uncontrollably every morning i think this will genuinely improve my quality of life
LifeProTips,not_removed,imo milk works much better for this when i vomit after drinking milk there is no pain at all and it doesnt taste as bad either
LifeProTips,not_removed,however if you have the stomach flu like i did last week then drinking water can actually unsettle the stomach inducing prolonged vomiting i vomited every minutes for hours because of those few glasses of water i had to make vomiting easier my thought process was the same as i hate gagging when youve got nothing to throw up i ended up in the hospital for severe dehydration
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes when i throw up my testicals hurt
LifeProTips,not_removed,milk is even better than water
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you know you are going to drink to excess chew your food well really well
LifeProTips,not_removed,also prepare yourself if you know its coming tie your hair back take off your glasses grab a cup of water so you can rinse your mouth after etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you know youre gonna vomit iesickness exertion high gforce loads etc eat nothing but peanut butter sandwiches tastes the same coming up as it does going down
LifeProTips,not_removed,i tried beer didnt work
LifeProTips,not_removed,cold red gatorade works well soothing on the throat and doesnt taste as bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,nope immediate reaction is tie hair back before i get puke all over my face
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah sunday mornings
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive found that that coupled with controlled breathing and rythmically saying im not gonna puke works wonders though now that im not terrified of puking ill force myself to get it over with
LifeProTips,not_removed,damn right u a clone of me
LifeProTips,not_removed,do you drink to much at once like milk water isnt meant to be chugged
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have this same problem in the mornings no idea why
LifeProTips,not_removed,ice cold water actually makes things worse you wanna drink warmroom temp water in sips also smelling a lemon or another strong citrus really helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have slight morning nausea every single morning ive had that most of my life i force myself to have glasses of cold water but otherwise i dont eat anything until lunch the idea of eating in the morning makes me queasy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think its if you do it too quickly one morning i ate too much having not drank yet that morning then chugged two large glasses of water needless to say i broke my year vomit free streak soon after
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i puked in my friends sink they would be upset
LifeProTips,not_removed,i get migraines and when i puke with those i feel much better if i really feel the need to puke ill go lean over the toilet because the same combined with the headache will make me vomit right away
LifeProTips,not_removed,if your toilet smells like urine i recommend flushing and maybe cleaning it once in a while your toilet shouldnt have an odor
LifeProTips,not_removed,i go outside when i have to puke assuming it isnt not outside thankfullyunfortunately its always night or early morning when i get sick i find that being confined to a room makes me feel overheated and makes the process worse than it has to be though that may be due to my parents gathering either around me or at the door being outside makes me feel actually kinda chilly and you dont have to worry about that puke smell coming back up to your nose
LifeProTips,not_removed,but then if you do throw up you have no saliva left to protect your teeth sounds like a double edged knife and i wouldnt risk it my take on vomiting is if it wants to come out you let it out the body knows whats best for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,watering down your stomach acid before throwing up is never a bad thing i have thrown up straight stomach acid before because of football and it was unpleasent also if you are throwing up from alcohol dry heaving is the absolute worst and water gives you something to throw up
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes you just need to vomit
LifeProTips,not_removed,absolutely wake up in a bad way and thirsty down water run to the toilet every time get the poison out
LifeProTips,not_removed,whats the worst mess youve ever seen
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive heard the reason we often salivate heavily when the urge to vomit slowly arises is because it induces vomiting and we need to get something out spitting seems to have worked for me last time that happened
LifeProTips,not_removed,tried that on an alcoholinduced vomitmorning the milk turned into cottage cheese and i threw up bile
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh god i remember watching my friends do the gallon challenge and when they puked it up it smelled like already sour milk
LifeProTips,not_removed,then youre already vomiting and its way too late
LifeProTips,not_removed,soda is acidic so it wont neutralize the hydrochloric acid in your stomach
LifeProTips,not_removed,if my tummy is sick milk is an immediate vomit trigger
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe because of the bubbles try warm flat beer instead
LifeProTips,not_removed,doesnt taste as bad aswater
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah youth youll get yer sealegs someday laddie
LifeProTips,not_removed,also friday and saturday mornings sometimes monday too
LifeProTips,not_removed,i actually did that once because i couldnt make it to the bathroom luckily it was all beer sick as i hadnt eaten and doubly lucky he had a completely empty sink i felt bad though
LifeProTips,not_removed,i didnt consider this a party tip or guest tip that said i dont draw a guestbehavior distinction about puking in a sink or a toilet both are bad guest behavior but if my friends needed to puke anywhere anything that isnt carpet furniture or car is going to be a bonus
LifeProTips,not_removed,sinks are one of the dirtiest things in the average kitchen so by puking in your friends sink you force someone to disinfect it really youre doing them a favor
LifeProTips,not_removed,my toilet and bidet are very clean thank you its not unusual to smell biological residue with your face in a toilet no matter how tidy you are and there are a multitude of reasons including men and children who miss and perhaps even faulty seals on the floor mount area but your snide tip which assumes facts not in evidence has been noted btw just briefly took a look at your comment history to wonder okay whos this guy insulting another person for no reason whatever disguising it as a snide tip saw your comment straight away on a post about trying to be nice to people regularly visiting rwholesomememes has helped me quite a bit with this issue once you start actively trying to choose positivity over negativity it gets easier each time you try stay subscribed and give it another visit your own tip suggests it will get easier i visit that r as well when im down or a bit saturated with unnecessary meanness
LifeProTips,not_removed,good that you have time to plan for and aim at the right shrubs birds and critters probably are happy the only time i ever had to vomit outside was over the side of a boat in hawaii not from seasickness but rather from some bad food what started as being an embarrassing moment turned into sheer hilarity as our boat was surrounded by colorful fish who went insane with happiness that biohazard site was cleaned up in seconds flat
LifeProTips,not_removed,literally this why feel like shit for several hours just chug a big glass of water and hurl your brains out then go about your day use mouthwash but dont brush
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am this way as well vomiting has never bothered me so i prefer throwing up to feeling like shit but you have to be careful because vomiting too much can scar your esophagus
LifeProTips,not_removed,literally this why feel like shit for several hours just chug a big glass of water and hurl your brains out then go about your day use mouthwash but dont brush
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was so sick back in december and i swear the only thing that didnt make it worse was after each time i was done puking i drank a huge glass of water i puked a dozen times that night and after the first time it wasnt as bad as the first time as it was just water coming out
LifeProTips,not_removed,not me the tip was passed on from said nurses
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah that rings a bell something about tricking the brain that weve already got rid of whatever it was
LifeProTips,not_removed,the trick here is if you know youre going to puke milk gets it over with and wont wreck your throats with acid if youre trying to not vomit water or ice chips definitely
LifeProTips,not_removed,it seems counterintuitive i realize but it absolutely works i found this explanation on a forum though cola itself is acidic it is mildly acidic compared to stomach acid and might diminish even acidbased irritation through dilution moreover the bicarbonate buffer system the most important ph regulating reaction in the human body allows cola or human fluids containing from respiration to buffer the acid directly the acidity of coke primarily comes from the dissolved in water h if you add excess h acid to this system it will turning a conjugate base into carbonic acid and releasing carbon dioxide and water from the carbonic acid a weak acid its a equilibrium excess alkaline wil be reduced by the reaction going in the other direction
LifeProTips,not_removed,this guy chucks
LifeProTips,not_removed,water tastes bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,it tastes better coming back up than water haha
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did this in a friends bathroom sink once the toilet was already occupied with other people vomiting so i went for the second best option he was not amused
LifeProTips,not_removed,if the host and others are drinking excessively someone is gonna puke
LifeProTips,not_removed,wasnt meant as an insult it was meant as humor and im sorry that it didnt come across that way i will say i tend to keep my bathroom very sanitized as my spouse has a weak immune system so everything gets cleaned thoroughly on a very regular basis and has no odor anytime it does it gets cleaned again its difficult to read intent in text though your intent is pretty clear i think it does seem odd to tell someone to be nice when they are not being particularly nice either
LifeProTips,not_removed,why are you so defensive
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont aim for the shrubs but thanks i do try my best to plan
LifeProTips,not_removed,when its inevitable i just induce vomiting i feel so much better afterwards plus its a great way to stay in shape
LifeProTips,not_removed,i vomit not more than once a year anyway so scaring my whatyousaid isnt a bothersome thought but i guess this is a useful tip for some people as i know some that vomit regularly voluntarirly or not
LifeProTips,not_removed,huh til
LifeProTips,not_removed,better than on furniture or carpet
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah no i made it to the kitchen sink
LifeProTips,not_removed,recommend flushing and maybe cleaning it once in a while no way to misinterpret that as anything other than a very impolite jab or judgment that i have pissy smelly unwashed toilet which isnt flushed regularly thanks for the reachout however i understand the sanitizing issue im somewhat the same and and frankly feel notcleanenough any time i have to use a restroom which doesnt have a bidet for that matter
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought it was a totally unnecessary rude and uncalled for comment which contributed absolutely nothing to the tip my comment or the thread calling it humor after the fact is just an excuse as there was no attempt at humor i know welcome to reddit and so it goes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought the comment was humorous at no point did i interpret it as yeah this guy has a point that other user must have a filthy toilet someone makes a joke and you take it as a personal attack
LifeProTips,not_removed,some indeed may read it as a funny i still fail to see humor in ignoring my actual tip and commenting that i should flush my toilet and clean it once in a while without a trace of levity more than one of that ops recent comments dealt with avoiding snark and rudeness and being pleasant more than the single comment i quoted so i found there to be a bit of hypocrisy i still dont see or believe there was any intended levity and im fairly lighthearted person but hey thats okay others did glad they were amused i wasnt
LifeProTips,not_removed,i constantly break glasses so i just buy the most popular ikea sets because theyre always available

LifeProTips,not_removed,college is supposed to be a place to learn about your future career not a four year party this obsession with being a fuck off during college is like thinking porn is like sex
LifeProTips,not_removed,no youre paying a year for school do not fuck around study and work your ass off you have plenty of time for fun once you start your career

LifeProTips,not_removed,go to community college and try many different courses yes in the end some of those credits wont transfer into the program you finally choose however it is a very cheap way to filter out possibilities never underestimate the value of discovering what you dont want to do
LifeProTips,not_removed,what are you passionate about
LifeProTips,not_removed,id take a year off from college to do a gap year program like americorps they pay for your flight to go to a different state to do a year of service in whatever interests you technology disaster relief etc heres a link with diff programs httpusagapyearfairsorgprograms i recommend applying to college first this way it kinda saves you a seatfinancial aid if you do it before applying to college scholarships may have a tougher time deciding to give it to you lateror they could love you even more for doing a gap year program to give back first you never know with americorps they give like an education grant when youre done with the year of service
LifeProTips,not_removed,computer science once you get your year degree go get a job that pays use the disposable income to then go pursue whatever hobby you have on the weekends if history is your thing then use your disposable income to take vacations to historic sites and be a historian in your spare time dont mix the thing you enjoy doing with the thing you do professionally to make money yes sometimes those things mix and people live amazing lives where they do their hobby professionally but those are the rare few which is why we publicize and talk about them so much
LifeProTips,not_removed,i majored in the wrong thing i followed my passion and scoffed at family who advised me to plan a career backup i now have a masters degree and two bachelors degrees and i do not work in that field not even close now i am doing ok i own a small business but i wish i had spent some time on other skills that would have helped me today community college and vocational courses volunteering for causes that interested me studying more about the actual work in my field would have clued me in that i wasnt suited for it here is an amazing resource that i used during vocational counseling it helped guide me towards starting my business hope this is helpful httpswwwonetonlineorg
LifeProTips,not_removed,lots of math and englishwriting if you have those you can pick up the rest later
LifeProTips,not_removed,career counselor theres also free internet tests called riasec that will give you a letter personnality code and with that you can see what kind of jobs would potentially motivate you
LifeProTips,not_removed,you dont know what you want to do in life here are a few suggestions join the military theyll give you good pay life experience and time to decide what you want to do also free school is a plus or do your basics first like match english etc and join a club or group in things youre interested in to see if you wanna go that route speak with family members and see what their thoughts are on careers im and going for a degree in fire science firefighting pay isnt going to be six figures but its a job i can be happy doing for the rest if my life
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont come from an incredibly wealthy family so switching makes me worry that ill have to stay longer meaning more money so im wary of that
LifeProTips,not_removed,the community colleges around south east pa arent the greatest and its kind of dishonorablefor lack of a better word
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had all as in ap history classes in high school so i like history
LifeProTips,not_removed,riasec ill check it out thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought about doing what my ma did which was join after high school and go to tech school for
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know several firefighters that earn well into the six figures because as they tell me overtime is a constant reality for them the downside apparently is that unless you move up into management chiefdom your career is short relative to others owing to the physical strain one friend of mine an assistantchief says that the injury rate for firefighters is thus it tends to be a wellpaid career
LifeProTips,not_removed,she switched after a year and it was fine time wise most of your first year at least in the us where i am consist of liberal arts that are required for everyone and only classes specific to your major of course every college is different though but extra student loans vs misery your entire life in a career you hate
LifeProTips,not_removed,take english classes at community college then tuition is cheaper than a classes are the same for the figure out what you want to do without all the debt after you get your general classes out of the way you should have a better idea where you want to go and do trades like plumbing are an excellent opportunity for someone to have their own business dont underestimate them and if you live in pa then move to eastern nc like of pittsburgh has and live like a king fixing toliets as we have shitty tradesmen
LifeProTips,not_removed,now lets extrapolate do you like being indoors or outside do you enjoy talking to people or would you rather work alone do you enjoy travel do you like getting your hands dirty are you a bookworm are you technologically inclined
LifeProTips,not_removed,are you going to go work at the history factory if not find a real degree that produces value if you want to be employed after going into debt for school
LifeProTips,not_removed,people keep telling you that theres no money in history and thats sort of true if you want to work in that field but theres many companies that look upon history degrees favourably because youre taught how to do research and write reports
LifeProTips,not_removed,cool httpwwwwiueducashistorycareeroppphp
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a really nice way of saying theres no money in history
LifeProTips,not_removed,not at all just looking at different options education archeologists meusem curator
LifeProTips,not_removed,lets be real there are way more people with masters degrees and doctorates in history and related fields than there are jobs in those fields the likelihood of a person with a history degree making reasonable money in the field of study enough to pay off student loans and start a family is about as likely as a college basketball player making it to the nba history is really important and it makes a fine hobby minor in history if you want but pick a major that offers a good path to a well paying career and enjoy history as a hobby honestly i love history especially the neolithic through the start of written history in mesopotamia humans have independently invented writing numerous times and i find the details of that process fascinating i drive my wife nuts taking her to parts of museums she has little interest in seeing but a career in it that seems a bit masochistic to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,life pro tip dont be a dick
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is terrible advice give someone money if you want or dont but dont try to be a condescending selfrighteous jerk about it if you dont feel like giving someone money just say no i do it all the time simple as that
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you feel this is necessary why even bother giving them money in the first place
LifeProTips,not_removed,no matter how badly i needed money i would never accept it from someone who was going to use it as a means of criticizing my choices and priorities
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you trust them give them the money if you dont trust them dont dont be a fucking prick about it and ask for proof that is one of the biggest asshole moves i have seen in lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,i can understand checking a balance if you truly do not believe they are in dire need but going through their transactions would be pushing the bounds even if you are about to give them money
LifeProTips,not_removed,life phucked tips this sub has gone to shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just ask them whats going on if you dont trust them to tell you the truth or believe what they say why would you give them money in the first place you dont need proof you need to trust the person
LifeProTips,not_removed,it sounds like the intention is not to help but to teach a lesson
LifeProTips,not_removed,worst pro tip ive ever seen
LifeProTips,not_removed,regardless of whether or not this is a dick move it wouldnt really work for people who pay for everything with cash in my experience people who are always broke and need money from family dont have bank accounts or credit cards other than that i think this advice is fine whats meaner refusing to help them or asking them to prove they need it before giving it i totally understand where some of you are coming from when you say this sounds awful but in the case of having a friendfamily member who is chronically broke which i believe is what the op is referring to in general and that person does use a card for purchases this could really help remedy the situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,in the right circumstances that would work not all though
LifeProTips,not_removed,next time you guys apply for a needbased scholarship tell them theyre jerks for asking for your financial information they should just trust you right
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think the point is to be nice to them but teach them a lesson at the same time kinda like a dont do it again
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah this is like a life pro tip if you are trying to get everyone to hate you lpt if you want everyone to not like you anymore ask to see their bank statements and then criticize them
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you need to borrow money from family or friends to pay for some necessityisnt that big enough evidence that your decisions and priorities should be criticised
LifeProTips,not_removed,then you dont need money that badly also if you have stuff to be criticized and non unversal priorities you shouldnt be asking for money and people would be right in not wanting to give it to you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think its about trust as much as its about budgeting and accountability if my siblings blow their paychecks on garbage and then cant feed their kids if i just give them money then im essentially enabling an addict i wont loan money to family or friends because i value those relationships and i dont want to just give them money which i am happy to do but i dont want to become a crutch or somebody that is going to enable their bad decisions going forward having them show me their statements forces them to look at what they spent money on instead of saving for rent or buying groceries to me its all about accountability
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not so much about believing them that they need money but trying to figure why they need money a quick gift from a family memeber doesnt close the wound just wipes the blood up
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hope they super adore me when they are able to house their children based on my charityif they get mad at me for wanting to stop their cycle of horrible financial decisions then thats their problem their feeling go out the fuckin window when i feed their responsibilities
LifeProTips,not_removed,it enables them to take the blinders off and see what theyve been spending on this is not a trust issue its a solution issue
LifeProTips,not_removed,or to prove how superior the giver thinks he is
LifeProTips,not_removed,i totally agree with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah yes because giving a gift to a loved one is identical to applying for a loan from a corporation
LifeProTips,not_removed,i could see this more if this was about loaning someone the money but they are talking specifically about giving this money as a gift and imagine if you applied this to a different kind of gift oh before i give you this shirt i need you to show me your other clothes to prove youre worthy of it its just a shitty way to approach it edit your youre silly grammar
LifeProTips,not_removed,who said anything about critcizing its called accountablity
LifeProTips,not_removed,but this lpt isnt about a loan it is about a gift it specifically says not a loan
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree those are two completely separate things but if someone is in need to the point of needing some cash to make rent or something i dont think financial counseling is going to help them make the rent
LifeProTips,not_removed,need based financial aid normally comes from the governmentunless its a scholarship situation which would come from some sort of charitable organization or trust
LifeProTips,not_removed,wellwhats more shitty is giving them dollars one month dollars then next and the nextwhen the make just as much or more than you im happy to help out my family which is why i dont loan i give it them knowing that i know their shitty at sending creates accountability and not dependence due to misbehavior
LifeProTips,not_removed,me hey can i borrow dollars so i can pay my electricity bill you sure here ya go you dont have to pay me back but im going to need to see your bank statements for the past months so i can call you out on all the shit you bought and make you feel like a piece of garbage while at the same time feeling superior to you me go fuck yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats true a little planning wont help them pay the rent this month but it may help the next month and the month after i had a sister that spent somewhere between on a birthday party for her daughter the next week she called me and couldnt pay her dollar rent its like did you not expect to pay rent this month why did you spend so much on a birthday party that you couldnt afford
LifeProTips,not_removed,either stop giving them money or stop fucking complaining about it grow the fuck up
LifeProTips,not_removed,so you dont know how to say no if you dont want to give someone something like money the solution is that you dont if they have a problem with it that is on them if you are happy to help someone out then help them out dont attach strings to it because that isnt about giving or helping that is about trying to get something out of it other than the pleasure of helpingdoing something nice for someone
LifeProTips,not_removed,me hey did you not expect that youd have an electricity bill this month why did you spend dollars on your daughters birthday party oh well heres bucks to keep the lights on maybe you should plan out your monthly expenses next month
LifeProTips,not_removed,okay as long as you arent making one contingent on the other as in you see the erroneous spending and then decide not to help its gotta be a package deal
LifeProTips,not_removed,hes helping his family out in two ways here providing financial assistance and creating an accountability that will help make them more financially stable i dont see how this is complaining
LifeProTips,not_removed,something else out of itlike a solution to the real problem
LifeProTips,not_removed,find a poem or two that you like and memorize it gradually take as long as you need but recite it when youre at home or in the car or wherever youre alone practice the tone and meter of the poem and get used to speaking performing it out loud then remember how those words felt when you are speaking normally
LifeProTips,not_removed,i highly recommend tongue twisters heres a great article that talks about how to approach practicing them httpwwwwriteoutloudcomdictionexerciseshtml this is similar to a warmup routine we use to do in theatre classes when i was younger that helps articulation also it helps to warm up your facial muscles before hand with some articulator exercises
LifeProTips,not_removed,bite a pen on your mouth kinda like and try talking as clearly as you can
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree with at time of writing this everyone else is giving dumb advice their hearts are in the right place but the advice they give you would only misguide you i also suggest that you find a place that allows you to type out a conversation with someone i found that typing helped me start to build my thoughts after all its best to think before you say something typing makes it fine to think for a few minutes at least before you hit enter eventually for me it later started to effect my vocal conversations maybe what worked for me will work for you as well again in closing i would suggest you also take the advice of
LifeProTips,not_removed,electrocution lessons it sounds cruel but stephen fry had them and listen to him
LifeProTips,not_removed,you could fill your mouth with pebbles like demosthenes

LifeProTips,not_removed,solutions get a new phone number and give it only to your friends family coworkers never use it to register anywhere online for that you can use your old number or get an app like sideline that will give you another one get a caller id app i personally use truecaller it will let you know if the call youre receiving has been reported as spam before so you dont pick it up and give you an option to block it in the future
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am a senior attorney at the fcc who handles robocall enforcement heres my advice first file a complaint with the fcchttpsconsumercomplaintsfccgovhcenus the best thing to do when you receive one of these robocalls is not respond at all dont press any buttons to speak to a representative the reps are really just scammers dont press any buttons that claim to remove your number from their calling lists because the opposite is truethe scammers look to see who responds so they know which numbers to call again that will result in a real person answering as you have already noticed the people who make scam robocalls use spoofed numbers to evade detection by law enforcement and by telephone carriers fraud departments this is a global problem not just an american one masscalling spoofing technology has gotten so cheap that phone numbers are experiencing the same problems that plagued email back in the mid to scammers and spammers flooding inboxes with mass quantities of unwanted communications the solution for email was widespread adoption of message authentication protocols and eternal vigilance a similar effort is underway to bring authentication protocols to the global telephone network spoofing makes it very difficult for us to locate the true origin of illegal robocalls that said please do continue to file complaints with the fcc even if we cant follow up on every single individual complaint we do in fact read all of them and use them to understand trends also when you file a complaint with us it is most helpful if you list the exact date and time you received the call your phone number the name of your carrier and the information that showed up on caller id hope this helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres not a good way for exactly the reason you say push one down another pops up you can make sure youre on the federal do not call registry and you can report any of these calls thats not going to do much they know about them you can change your phone number you can use a service like nomorobo or on my cell phone i have mr number that tries to keep a list of unacceptable numbers to block them ahead of time and lets you whitelist numbers that are okay or in your contact list mostly its your first world problem and you can do what you want waste some time talking with them hang up right away use caller id to not answer etc just remember the people at the other end of the phone know theyre doing a scam know its illegal may hate what theyre doing but cant find another job and theyre not going to put you on a do not call list because as soon as you ask theyre just going to hang up and move along and may even flag you to get more calls out of spite only legitimate businesses follow the law
LifeProTips,not_removed,find some music and turn it up press to speak to an agent place the phone next to the speaker wait for the call to end after or of these ear piercing events the calls will subside you do run the risk of a lawsuit but that would require the person on the other end to disclose their location thereby opening themselves to a robocall suit from you
LifeProTips,not_removed,came here for true caller best fucking app
LifeProTips,not_removed,hadnt heard of truecaller thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,seriously thanks for your response and the work the fcc is doing to put a stop to it ill be sure to file a complaint i thought about filing one before but it felt pointless since i knew it was a spoof number its good to know that it has an effect i actually learned on npr not to respond but it must have been too late since i didnt know when they first started they still think that somehow i might just give up and give them my social security number and a copy of my birth certificate
LifeProTips,not_removed,how does playing music open myself up to a suit
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha i love the gif thanks for your kind words
LifeProTips,not_removed,if its loud enough to cause damage
LifeProTips,not_removed,depending on the backpack you may also be able to just remove the clips this also prevents them from possibly melting in the dryer
LifeProTips,not_removed,so this somehow makes it quieter when it is hanging on the line out in the sun
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think hanging you out in the sun might make you quieter cant speak for the backpack though
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was in jest your op doesnt imply a dryer appliance

LifeProTips,not_removed,evening shower most people shower in the morning
LifeProTips,not_removed,god no you animal dont sleep in your filth shower your day off you at night
LifeProTips,not_removed,i shower day and night
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive never seen a toothbrush travel case big enough to hold a spoon or a fork
LifeProTips,not_removed,do stuff you like or new stuff you think you might like youll meet people with similar interests just dont expect it overnight
LifeProTips,not_removed,i really recommend meetup groups if you have them in your area i was a bit selfconscious at first but it was honestly one of the best things i have ever done after my divorce to meet new people i have made some really great friends and have had a lot of fun experiences there are tons of different groups based on your interests especially if you live in a goodsized city good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,take a class university art something your interested in join a baseball team yoga class run a club volunteer get passionate about a sports team cause or hobby and find the local group that loves the same thing this is so hard but be the person to go out on a limb and ask the people you meet out for a drink or for coffee meeting new people as an adult is really hard good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you have a dog i definitely recommend taking it to a dog park never have i seen so many friendly strangers come out of the woodwork someone else suggested this but definitely consider volunteering for a cause you believe in you may meet people with similar interests and thats a good start i moved to a new city about years ago and the only person i knew was my thenhusband i made it my policy to say yes to every invitation to get to know people and expand my horizons
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you like books go to the book store ask if they have any book clubs if you like bars bring your book to the bar and read at the bar if you like crosswords bring it to the bar if you like to work out look for group classes if you like sowing are you getting the idea

LifeProTips,not_removed,counter lpt for you op you might be still feeling the residual effects of being saved by barbra but words are ultimately bandaids over a wound if you are struggling with mental illness then you should treat it like any other disease and seek medical attention for it asap even if you feel better right now why take the risk theres obviously an issue if things got that bad for you so seek help and do your best to make an effort to work through your issues the fact that you made this post shows that whatever she said helped you so take care of yourself while youre able to op it might be too late if you choose to do nothing now and allow yourself to slip back into a dark place where youll almost certainly feel too unmotivated to bother seeking help edit punctuation and stuff
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just go to rwholesomememes
LifeProTips,not_removed,why does it never get better though even after you take steps to improve every day i stopped trying to pursue help because it generally always backfires but i have come to accept that it is ultimately not my decision to make and mother time will serve the exit papers when the time is right until then every day a new day to well stagnation is no way forward but to breath and walk the dogs and refresh their water and feed them food then to work enough to be able to sustain the charade
LifeProTips,not_removed,i called the hotline once i was told they were extremely busy and my situation wasnt important enough the whole conversation felt scripted and i didnt feel valued
LifeProTips,not_removed,being loved doesnt equate to being happy
LifeProTips,not_removed,the idea of leaning on a complete stranger to save my life is so far beyond me at this point i tried to end myself a month ago at the beginning of december i dont know if im glad im still here not sure but im glad i had that one friend come get me my one friend my mom didnt i called from the hospital i told one maybe two people they shied away people dont care or are frightened by it there is very little empathy left in the world you either are here and want it bad enough to keep trying or you dont purgatory is being between the two too broken to succeed too well put together to be happy with mediocrity
LifeProTips,not_removed,about years ago i finally went to talk to a doctor about my sadness after struggling with it for a couple of years he brushed it off and said there was nothing wrong with me it was such a horrible feeling being told that you dont feel what you feel this was back when i was having daily suicidal thoughts and was cutting myself perhaps it was never as serious as getting ready to jump off a bridge but it was bad enough that i was skipping classes failing badly at school staying in bed to avoid facing the world it took me years to finish what should have been a year degree i told myself that i would need to learn how to fix myself because i was exhausted with that constant feeling of hopelessness i was sick of hating myself i no longer trusted doctors nor did i want to waste what little energy i had on discussing my problems with people who werent trained professionals anyway i wanted an alternative to being dependant on antidepressants for the rest of my life over the years i have discovered that there are so many alternative resources strategies out there selfhelp blogs and youtube videos personal development books etc eg mans search for meaning by victor frankl personal power by tony robbins emotional intelligence by daniel goleman anything by eckhart tolle stephen covey dale carnegie alan watts yoga meditation maintaining a gratitude journal focusing on the positives rather than negativity limiting how much news i consumed weight training running group fitness classes learning how to cook eating healthy especially reducing alcohol sugar fried foods avoiding porn limiting online activity and spending much more time offline and outside volunteering at a homeless shelter picking up new hobbies investing time in a community drinking more water making sure to shower every day making my bed everyday keeping my room clean and decluttered of crap turning off tvnetflixcable creating more content than consuming it rather than compare myself with people who have more i work on being grateful for everything i have there is no one easy permanent fix and not everything will work for everyone but each of these strategies are just small daily gifts of selflove the most important relationship you can have is the one that you maintain with yourself life itself is an ongoing journey on how to adult better find peace just remember that every single human on the planet is winging it through life each day and everyone has their own shit to deal with regardless of how well you may perceive their life to be create a productivity routine starting with what you can do for mins everyday in the morning when you wake up build from there i hope that some of you find these suggestions useful no one in my life knows about my past or that i deal with depression because im a very private person and am good at putting on a happy face i still have poor days but those days are much fewer and easier to deal with sending much unconditional love you are all not alone disclaimer for some people working with a good doctor therapist or counsellor is going to be their most effective approach it takes strength to ask for help and courage to make use of that help you need to find your own truth
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah call someone who is paid to care who doesnt know you thatll solve it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know im not loved it is something i have come to accept
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a hard thing to talk about thank you for your strength and welcome back
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,well thanks for trying however i have to say that telling me that i am loved has absolutely no effect on me actually it kind of irritates me because ive heard that phrase used over and over again and i know its bullshit whenever i hear it and im pretty sure the people who say it know it is as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am willing to hold a conversation with anyone considering ending their life ive lost people in my life to suicide and know it might feel like the solution to all your problems but its not it creates more for us living
LifeProTips,not_removed,one of my best friends tried to commit suicide two nights ago he called me today and he our other best friend and i talked for a while he knows he is loved he has a young daughter who needs and loves him more than anyone i knew he was going through shit but i never thought he was deeply depressed and wanted to harm himself from now on if i know a friend is having a hard time im going to be overly caring with them text them at least once a day and ask how they arebug them the giving spaceprivacy thing after telling someone youre there for them once or twice does not work sometimes im glad youre okay op if anyone needs to talk dm me have a safe new year everyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,for any crisis you may use httpwwwcrisistextlineorgtextline in crisis text hello to you all matter we all matter and are in this together my friends talk to anyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are loved yes yes i am but do i love myself no definitely no
LifeProTips,not_removed,i find the you are loved comments from strangers to be weird you dont know me or my life and if you dont you have no reason to truly care for me also all the well wishes in the world dont matter if someone wont actually do anything to alleviate my pain then words are basically pissing into the wind are you whoever you are going to give me a job or money or better luck in life are you going to make therapy affordable or my life easier to manage if not the fear and pain will be there when youre gone and just as bad the only reason i havent done myself in is a fear of going to hell if i kill myself
LifeProTips,not_removed,years ago when i was in a much worse place i called that hotline jerkoff on the other end started rudely and angrily accusing me in like seconds of being a prank caller and demanding i explain myself he said he heard other ppl laughing and talking on my end i was sitting alone in my basement really turned me off from reaching out for a long time the guy was just such an asshole and threatened to call the police and give them my number
LifeProTips,not_removed,complete bs nobody loves me not everyone is the same not everyone can be loved im not gonna do it yet but the thoughts come more and more ive reached out but was just called an attention whore since im all words so ive stopped reaching out act like everythings ok one day it wont just be empty words idk if its in tho doubt it
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are all loved thats a hell of a lot easier to say over the internet to perfect strangers than it is to live not being so ive never known love parents dont count and at this rate i likely never will getting a job didnt help losing some weight didnt help i just have a shit personality and dont even look at people unless i have to because im inferior to everyone so why even try they have better people to get to know
LifeProTips,not_removed,called the hotline once they did not answer the phone and sure i got through it but i think it serves as an example of why there should be better funding for the hotline
LifeProTips,not_removed,please call the hotline first doesnt include the hotline number
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i called suicide hotlines a few times and got no help whatsoever my parents were dead i was homeless and all i got were scripted platitudes and someone asking if i was about to kill myself so they could decide whether or not to call the police its an experience that will make you jaded
LifeProTips,not_removed,what hotline seriously what number
LifeProTips,not_removed,i called the hotline once and the guy seemed flustered like it was his first call but he was so sweet and calm and i started to calm down too even if we only talked for maybe mins i looking at google for places to crash my car that day places that didnt have much traffic or were secluded so i wouldnt hurt others in the process of hurting myself that was last year but im doing better these days by far
LifeProTips,not_removed,guys and girls weather it out please i was in the hospital last year twice for attempted today i am building back with gym training cooking and all of you guys to help me i love you all have a happy new year
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are all loved speak for yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,nothing is for certain except death and taxes a mind is a beautiful thing to waste
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can also ask to speak to a professional they are even willing to come to your house if necessary this is one of the things i learned after i was walked in on trying to kill myself two months ago if you dont feel comfortable on the phone or talking to people close to you go to the er the crisis team that is on call are very good at what they do they sent me to a crisis house for two weeks and these people are amazing i urge you to get help if you have any thoughts of hurting yourself it gets better i promise
LifeProTips,not_removed,i called a hotline once when my situation was dire i talked the lady i was speaking through to it and she said im sorry i dont know what to tell you i told her she needed more training and dont worry about me im just going to get drunk and i did and i do we all have to cope some how my way will just drain my bank account and kill me one day so it goes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was super desolate once called my best friend but he was at a reading of the cursed child this was this summer and i didnt wanna tell him it was urgent called maybe ten different hotlines it kept ringing out called several specific to my city nyc i could hardly catch my breath long enough to explain got put on hold and redirected to another hotline where i was scolded for coming with suicidal complaints when it was a domestic abuse hotline then my best friend who apparently wasnt enjoying the cursed child all that much called me back and talked to me for four hours till i was better dunno why i said all this besides that hotlines arent perfect i called ones for queer people generic ones nyc ones and all i got was berated and put on hold if nobody picks up pm me and ill send you as much love as i eventually got thanks bestie love you always
LifeProTips,not_removed,this sub is getting more stupid by the second
LifeProTips,not_removed,if people who are about to kill themselves could fully understand how many other humans are fucked up or right there with them they might not feel so alone it is a damn shame that so many younger people take their lives for what is just a chemical imbalance of the brain that could be solved or helped with the right combination of meds problem is when your brain isnt working well a lot of us tend to think that meds or anything can help also after straight years of trying alcohol only makes you more depressed alcohol is probably the worst thing for a depressed person to partake in
LifeProTips,not_removed,with high chance of getting downvoted to oblivion i just have to say this psychedelic mushrooms might help you a great deal they wont solve anything but they simply help you with your perspectives ive posed the question myself as well is it all worth it why not just cut the cord and get over with it i suggest to anyone whos suffering from depression do research on the subject and think about the mushroom maybe playing a roll in your life if not hey no hard feelings i hzd a hard time with it as well it took me over a year before i took the plunge since then well never looked back
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just go to the nearest hospital and tell the er nurse your feelings if you dont have anyone to talk too good luck op i try to remind myself that nothing is permanent except death so tomorrow may suck but next year you could meet the love of your life at the grocery store and best wishes
LifeProTips,not_removed,you do not have to be in danger to call the talk line can help in any emotional crisis i was safe but feeling like i was drowning in my depression they had counselors at my house within an hour and made sure i was okay to wait without them staying on the line please get help if youre stuck youre worth it
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey op i know im just some random guy on the internet but im glad you stuck around and thanks for this message the holidays can be low points for lots of people and in a small way its nice to have a reminder that youre not alone even in your miserableness
LifeProTips,not_removed,i see but no reason to be alive its going to be another bad year in which i will be lonely alone and sad crying on my bed because i am a coward who couldnt finish its own suffering remembering of how bad i was treated by some people remembering myself that i have always been rejected by people that i like and that i am unlikable i am sorry
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait so you figured out you are loved by calling someone who was paid to talk to the likes of you i might have bad news
LifeProTips,not_removed,what the hell are you even talking about
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the most life pro lpt ive ever seen
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks for staying
LifeProTips,not_removed,if some random lady convinced you over the phone you werent really going to kill your self in the first place
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive seen a lot of people post saying they tried to call but werent able to talk to anyone because their situation wasnt dire enough i highly recommend online for this they do webbased chat and theyll match you with someone who will just listen to you
LifeProTips,not_removed,also if you celebrate christmas do your best to give other people gifts it doesnt need to be expensive but watching their face light up that you even thought of them will make both your days you dont even need to celebrate christmas to give someone a gift you can do it any time to anyone i usually dont care for the holidays and often experience seasonal depression however this christmas i was able to get the few friends i have some gifts and it made me feel really good you can also think about it helping other people as if you were feeling down a present from someone you know maybe a stranger even just might make you stay for next year
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey op youre pretty cool for realizing that sharing something so personal can have an actual good effect on someone out there hope you find the peace you are looking for soon in a beautiful place
LifeProTips,not_removed,they hung up on me the only time i called i guess i was crying and a bit drunk and they couldnt understand me nor could i calm down felt bad man im just glad i kinda laughed it off a bit like f everyone and took a big swig and cried myself to sleep true story it was a circumstance reason for depression at the time just nothing was going right things are looking better
LifeProTips,not_removed,wasnt feeling too great on christmas looked up how others felt seems like suicide is lower with family around but it spikes during new years whenever people are gone i drugged myself up to hopefully get through this day
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you compare your life to someone elses and thats your basis for my depressing life you will never be happy i used to do this endlessly then i woke up and started thinking is my life better today than my life was yesterday and it quickly became so just out of sheer will also if you werent prepared in childhood for ups and downs adulthood is going to be so much harder look at your parents lives and see if they live a depressing life if so you can see where your problems began my mother was dealt a shitty hand but she never has gotten over it and became ok with settling i refuse to do that my father is a lonely old asshole living in fl and i am already a better father than he ever was anyway please dont give up it can always be better if you start with baby steps
LifeProTips,not_removed,last time i called a hotline i got told well i dont know what to tell you but ring back if theres anything else ive also been told to try gardening i dont think they know what they are on about i feel like im beyond help because no one knows what to say my last counselor told me that i cant go on like that when i said i couldnt sleep or eat so yeah
LifeProTips,not_removed,posting here to vent i guess i dont really know ive been in therapy of some kind for as long as i can remember and i know that im not well i have a loving mother who has fallen over herself to help me cope with my issues and a girlfriend who i love sincerely i just feel hollow it used to be whenever something bad happened id just dissociate and kind of go through the motions of being a person until i could snap myself back but i just feel like this all the time now its like every day is dragging myself through the last mile or so of a marathon like all of my limbs are moving on autopilot and recently ive just been thinking about how nice itd be to not be so tired anymore like i just want to throw my hands up and quit im loved and people care about me and are concerned for me but i want to die i really really want to die
LifeProTips,not_removed,have not had a hug let alone something more for years my only friends stopped talking to me a few months ago when they found out i had depression and the girl i had been flirting with just started dating someone else and i just started a new medication that will make me feel even more depressed while my body gets used to it i already got help but not sure i will make it through the next few weeks
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont really see the point in going on my family fight nonstop i have no prospects besides driving an uber or something like that failed a lot of community college not strong child believes in god but knows the world is better without me
LifeProTips,not_removed,being someone who generally has looked favorably upon life for a majority of it that ive existed through i make damn sure to tell people i love them all the time just as people i think its way important life can be a shit bag most of the time shit can just not improve and seem dumb and pointless i am of the mentality that its possible to will a lot of things to happen good or bad that it is also possible to best put yourself in fortunes way intentionally though landing on it is exceptionally difficult for everyone so that you at least have more frequent influx of opportunities missing an opportunity even maybe intentionally or subconsciously is ok too because the goal is to have more of them happening and to be learning as you go but that doesnt stop the fact that shit isnt good right now shit hasnt been good yet and hell they might not be at any point i like to reach out to people a lot because i tend to see a lot of potential in the quality of many peoples own person because unlike how our education system and our work system try to hammer into us our actual value has very little to do with a linear path set out for us by those above us in all facets of life social work educational etc and i feel has everything to do with our internal growth rate divided by time it took for it to happen plus our general benefit to humans and our many systems natural and otherwise did you not kill a single person today you gained us something and i personally thank you you dont get any money or a parade but you are astronomically more valuable than already many people who are alive right now i know it sounds kinda dumb when put that way but with how down and out people can truly get sometimes is in itself a crime but not one perpetuated by the down and out but by those who ignore those who suffer it doesnt take much to tell someone theyre good shit and you want them around regardless of what you think you have a value and its not in the lowrange you make people laugh in a way only you can write a story or music in a way only you can you kick ass at financial accounting i suck balls at it i had to pass my financial accounting class by being lucky enough to accidentally crash my car and have to hitch hike in which got me a sympathy grade boost or maybe youre the most chill person in the world to hang out with something about you is just better than other friends in your circle maybe youre way more charismatic and make everyone laugh all the damn time point being be very realistic about your pros and cons throw them away when youre done writing them down follow your heart finish your painting you brilliant asshole and love life
LifeProTips,not_removed,hows this a tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,hotlines have a chance of having a shitty worker on the line that finds a way to trace your call and send cops to you its sad because people who want help only get cops and stress added onto them sure it doesnt happen often but it happens often enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,i felt miserable before the holidays and i will feel miserable after it already called the hotline three times and was mostly disappointed i despise this existence
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are all loved by who
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was very unhappy for a long time worked a job i valued more than my own life i sacrificed relationships with friends and family for this job because i wanted to prove that i can be something i finally worked up got promoted started making decent money after a while i came to the realization that money doesnt buy happiness after years of depressionexistentialismdeliberation i decided to save enough money to quit and take a break it wasnt easy for me because i know my colleagues thought of me as weak for not being able to keep up i look back and realize i mightve quit my job but i didnt quit on life which was an alltooclose option for me im still on my break and will look for new work in about a month or so but ive been doing what i want to do everyday and just nurturing my soul im the happiest ive been since i was a kid because i learned how to care less about what people think of me and live life on my terms i was afraid to live and afraid to die thats no way to exist life is really too short do what makes you happy it can be the difference between life and death
LifeProTips,not_removed,humans are very good at projecting their own emotional experiences onto the world when i see complete strangers telling me im loved i cant help but think of a freshly converted religious disciple basking in the glow his savior and telling everyone how amazing their newlyappointed god is its just as trite and grossly insincere and meaningless ive hung out with hippies too though they might be even worse depression and shitty life experiences have hardenedembittered me not everyone is fortunate enough to get saved by a phone call or an exercise regime or whatever else i would never have the balls to tell a stranger they are loved because i know how cruel life really can be
LifeProTips,not_removed,seeing some of the comments in this thread breaks my fucking heart because they remind me so much of myself and id never wish anyone to feel the way i do
LifeProTips,not_removed,a lot of people dont realize that the fact that its winter is a big contributor of having a more negative attitude its called seasonal affective disorder and i suffer from it too i think one of the most important things especially during the winter months is to get at least minutes of exercise or medication some other type of quiettime activity and to call at least one friend or loved one once or twice a week at least this has made the holidays somewhat a bit more bearable as well as the winter months
LifeProTips,not_removed,love doesnt pay the bills
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i was dope sick and depressed days before i got clean woohoo i called a hotline for help all they did was try to get my insurance information and wanted to fly me down the fl for some expensive ass rehab place for days of treatment now almost months later jan will be my month i still get automated phone calls of places trying to get my info or asking if i or a love one wants to seek help its like bitch i did seek help quit calling me it totally made me feel like my life didnt matter and they just saw

LifeProTips,not_removed,im gonna do it at a gun range been flirting with it i just cant do it anymore seeking help works for some not for everyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,i teeter back and forth from wanting to live my subpar social anxiety depressed life as a recluse to wanting it all to just end not sure a phone call would help me but also afraid of the change that would happen from getting actual help
LifeProTips,not_removed,does it ever get any easier i realized after meeting with my therapist that my perception of reality was based on a life lived almost entirely in depression with a few other awful symptoms of abuse and traumatizing events thrown in i feel the progress that ive made over the last two or three years i havent hurt myself or even tried to in like over a year at this point maybe two but i dont feel happy i have good moments but i remember the bad ones i have good days but they disappear as soon as they are over i dont spiral as much as i used to but i still want to hurt myself or worse ive just got a condition which makes my skin extremely sensitive and even the slightest knick of a razor causes so much pain that i have even gone into mild shock over small cuts even though i know im doing better from an outside standpoint i dont feel any better i dont want to be alive but i am also terrified of taking any steps to further that line of thinking because of how much small things can hurt so badly i feel like as soon as the pain of daily life is worse than the physical pain ill be back at it with self harm and maybe even another suicide attempt its so disheartening to be in such a better position in life and still feel exactly as horrible as a few years ago as i improve so do my standards and i dont think im capable of happiness has anyone else ever felt this way does it really get better because i feel like im on the other side and its just as bad or worse

LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to volunteer at my countys suicide and crisis hotline its one of the most memorable and rewarding things i did in college i wish i could still do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,no one can save me from the relentless pessimism and self imposed loathing if i cannot save myself why should an anonymous stranger exhibit any empathy or compassion towards me depression irrevocably destroyed my life and ive tried to save myself from its pernicious presence a thousand times each time the hydra grows a new head
LifeProTips,not_removed,seem like no low is too low to harvest useless virtual internet karma

LifeProTips,not_removed,lots of innuendo in ops post here it is straight if youre contemplating murdering yourself call a hotline to see if someone can talk you into remaining alive 🤦‍♂️
LifeProTips,not_removed,so how diverse is your state and have you worked in the other what makes you think this individuals experiences are less valid or insightful than your own in what capacity do you work in allied health the quality of care and can caring can vary as widely as perceptions berating him only proves his point

LifeProTips,not_removed,they are the real suicide squad
LifeProTips,not_removed,sad to hear all the bad experiences some people here have had on the help phone lines sorry thats been your experience ive been on the help phone lines and chat lines as a volunteer for over a year now and will become a mentor for new volunteers come the new year i take every call and chat with great quality care and compassion ive only ever gotten positive feedback there are many good people who care and want to be there for you including myself i also will admit the quality of some volunteers isnt as good as others which is what has inspired me to become a mentor i know how hard it is to ask for help if youve had a bad experience on the help line just know there are good quality helpers wanting to be there for you not to brag but one guy told me he called three previous times and told me i was the best and only useful one hes spoken with
LifeProTips,not_removed,heres an upvote op because though i think this is well intentioned its nothing that severely depressed havent already heard in their lives
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you dont believe in an allloving god its tough to imagine that some stranger out there has any more than a passing concern for you your hearts in the right place im sure
LifeProTips,not_removed,im glad someone was there for you ive spent a good portion of my life suffering and struggling with my ptsd which has often led to depression it is only within the last year that i took my life back and found an inner peace that i didnt know could exist your life is important you are important also for anyone in need there are some great resources through wwwtwlohacom theyve been there for me countless times
LifeProTips,not_removed,but did you save barabara
LifeProTips,not_removed,cop out if you dont like something change it
LifeProTips,not_removed,also late to the game here people but try some meds i know there are many people with chronic depression who have tried every led under the sun and i know there are jackoffs like me who thought they could somehow overcome chemical imbalances on their own i just started trying some meds this year at because i was too stubborn and proud to do so earlier could have saved myself years of torturous thoughts and destructive behavior
LifeProTips,not_removed,is it true they send the police to your house if you call the suicide hotline
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think her name was brabra
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i was in college i volunteered for the county suicide hotline for two years i still remember the shifts i had on thanksgiving and new years eve those were hard nights and busy i decided to stop volunteering because it was so emotionally draining and it was hard for me to let go of the frustration and helplessness when a callers problems were left unsolved ironically i ended up trying to take my own life several times a couple years after college and had no desire to call the hotline for support i wish i had
LifeProTips,not_removed,what do you do when you feel massively weird every day life is so fucking weird
LifeProTips,not_removed,for a second i thought you were talking about a sex hotline and i got super confused
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think about being done on an hourly basis for euhm years now life is great s
LifeProTips,not_removed,i kinda thought you were telling me to call a hooker if im feeling down
LifeProTips,not_removed,i kinda thought you were telling me to call a hooker if im feeling down
LifeProTips,not_removed,i totally misread this as a sex hotline ad at first im glad to hear that they were able to help you and i hope you are able to find your happiness some day soon
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are not alone
LifeProTips,not_removed,anyone who has been through the system seeing a doctor etc have any thoughts on that route literally the only thing stopping me from finishing it all is that the consequences of failing and with that that a decent majority of suicides fail mean that i just cant take the risk
LifeProTips,not_removed,listen we all have problems and yours are not mine and mine are not yours and yes some people have clinical depression and so forth but i still say thisyou are responsible for your happiness two things that i have found that contribute to happiness finding things to be grateful for every day and helping someone else that especially will give you some sense of happiness just my two cents
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have to admit the only reason i was sad during the holidays is that virtually everything was disrupted now what are those store hours when is the dmv going to be open basically i dont plan on getting anything accomplished between the week before thanksgiving and the week after january if you are super sad during the holidays then you need to put together a holiday routine for yourself go away from what everybody else is doing or what you or your family have done in the past your new holiday might be traveling for instance if you have the money go to somewhere in the tropics like bahamas or mexico if you dont have the money you can still have an inexpensive vacation you will also find other people who have eschewed the traditional celebration and are making the holidays their own in their own way dont let yourself get bogged down in your sadness dont be a victim of the holidays start planning now for next year maybe save a little bit every week for your christmas vacation one of the best christmases i ever had was when a friend set up a long table in her front yard in costa rica and we had a huge meal with a group of friends and neighbors some costa ricans some americans some europeans we had a great time and there was no turkey or christmas decorations in evidence anywhere another good christmas i spend with my son in the florida keys looking through the glass bottomed boat at the living coral reef if you plan a christmas vacation to the tropics think about what you are going to do especially if you go alone maybe make a photography trip i went on one trip to nicaragua where i took photos of all the old buildings and horse and donkey carts this beats just lying on the beach all day or drinking in the bar taking local tours is also good if you have the money so christmas is gone and you have survived yay now for christmas and keep in mind all those visions you have of norman rockwell family christmas times are about true ill bet that a lot of folks who have a big family christmas wish they could just stay home and watch tv lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,im going to open a suicide support line that actually helps people with their goal of dying
LifeProTips,not_removed,so what exactly is the life pro tip here call the suicide prevention hotline if you feel suicidal i am sure people suffering from suicidal feelings never once considered that
LifeProTips,not_removed,these posts always irk me you were suicidal and someone talked you out of it thats great but that doesnt make you qualified to go make posts like these to save everyone acting like some messiah telling us we are all loved
LifeProTips,not_removed,no everyone is not loved
LifeProTips,not_removed,barbara only helps to put on a bandaid your wound is big and gaping get some real and serious help next time there may not be a barbara around
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a hard time understanding this because i personally cant understand the reasons for thinking so little of such a bounty ful life however my friend seems to be going through rough patches it pissed me off last night sense he lives away from me i didnt realize how far hes gone we went to some strippers cause he really wanted to and id thought id treat him but his behaviour was just terrible the obsessive drinkingof course he thought he wasnt even buzzed the revealing he snorts cocaine the idea that if i wasnt there he would have gone to a random strangers to party and do cocaine while sleeping with random women i had to pull him off that idea but he was bagging me to pick him up come morn than he says his body is just basically a tool to be used and he doesnt care about it pisses me off i care about it stop doing that shit hes obviously depressed and thinks he needs to do these girls and drugs to feel manly or feel some sort of accomplishment his friends back home obviously encourage this
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah good for you op happy new year
LifeProTips,not_removed,familial love has always been in abundance in my life romantic love is what would make me genuinely happy and thats hard to find when i am a bag of shit who is afraid of women with suppressed homosexual tendencies that i hate myself for
LifeProTips,not_removed,okay this is probably the most ambiguous lpt ive ever read it could either be someone being super lonely and getting a prostitute or someone who was saved from committing suicide im going with the latter
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you have people or family that love you then you should never consider this
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont do yourself in
LifeProTips,not_removed,just find a good game online or a hobby
LifeProTips,not_removed,through the schism i wander blind hedonism or suicide the end results seem to align main difference being the decline the only question is the time i wish to spend before i die seeking pleasure within this life sometimes i catch it by surprise for a moment its truly mine but there in my hands it divides losing half its worth every time chase it farther and i wonder who am i why am i each days a struggle just to try but for now i remain alive
LifeProTips,not_removed,no i think it was brabra

LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt for you glad you are still here but barbra is usually spelled barbara
LifeProTips,not_removed,big hugs from the west coast
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am very glad you are safe thank god a close friend committed suicide on christmas eve he was dealing with long term depression and despite all the help that his parents and i offered he just wouldnt accept any of it he ended up shooting his girlfriend and her father before turning the gun on himself the girlfriend was also killed the father wounded he is recovering last i heard believe me or not when i say this but i grew up with the guy for over half my life he was the nicest guy and always willing to help someone when things went south never complaining when doing so my family and i eventually moved and we werent able to hang out as often the man i grew up with inevitably was consumed by long term untreated depression and it claimed his life and the life of another in the end and absolutely devastated the lives of many others thinking that ones own life is meaningless and worth nothing is the most selfish thing anyone could possibly think and the longer that thought persists the more life threatening it becomes for both them and those who love them this isnt addressed to anyone specifically it is just a general statement you the reader might not know it but you are so very loved more so than you can possibly imagine and by more people than you could possibly believe any thoughts that creep into the back of your head trying to dissuade you of that must be rebuked immediately dont bear that cross on your own because its too heavy to carry on your own talk it out with someone you trust seek expert help get on legal medication develop a religious belief not trying to force my religious beliefs on anyone just saying whatever it is you need to do no matter how much it costs you or makes you feel uncomfortable do it whatever options you can find that will be beneficial to your health and not become a detrimental dependency substance abuse etc find it your life is worth it the sky might be cloudy today it may rain for weeks but the suns rays will pierce through the darkness and shine its warmth upon you it always will hang in there you are loved
LifeProTips,not_removed,god loves you just the way you are© dr gaius frakking baltar
LifeProTips,not_removed,i called the hotline twice once i was put on hold for over ten minutes another time was talking to someone whose second language is english she wasnt even listening to me and reading off a script
LifeProTips,not_removed,if anyone needs anyone to talk to tonight just send me a pm im going to be up most of the night and would love to chat
LifeProTips,not_removed,its almost and im sat at home bored and alone i have no real close friends no aspirations i spend each day waiting for the next one im depressed and have been for over a year now ive had suicidal thoughts before but havent tried anything i work a dead end job and to be completely honest i cant really see a light at the end of the tunnel ive had enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you need a nontalk hotline has trained listeners and it is conducted completely through text blah therapy is has random people who go on and decide to just help without requiring training and im pretty sure both have therapists that you can pay to have the texting with remember that things do get better it wont happen immediately and it requires you put work into actively changing things but things do change anyone is welcome to pm me if they need someone to talk to
LifeProTips,not_removed,why where you so sad
LifeProTips,not_removed,available hours every day

LifeProTips,not_removed,what if i want help but dont have insurance or money
LifeProTips,not_removed,also check the side effects of any medication you may be taking for unrelated issues the new birth control i was taking and the way i was taking it pretty much stole the last four months of my life within a few days after i stopped taking it i was feeling back to normal
LifeProTips,not_removed,your post probably saved more people than op
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry but im absolutely unable to stand this place when im feeling miserable its like people bugging you why dont you smile a little when you are feeling like shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i can relate to this i have accepted that im not going to be happy or loved and it became easier to just exist
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youve got dogs you have a reason to live those little bastards will love you unconditionally forever fuck people dogs are the best
LifeProTips,not_removed,it is ultimately not my decision to make and mother time will serve the exit papers when the time is right so well stated this has been my thinking for decades life is a quick trip might as well experience it as tough as that may be at times
LifeProTips,not_removed,for anyone feeling this way i sincerely hope you realize that you can work with a doctor to avoid feeling this way its not normal to feel this way if you are working with someone and you still feel like this find someone else to work with or get a deeper understanding with the doctor jayventure i dont know why it doesnt improve i know how it feels to get slapped in the face when you are reaching out for help by the people offering it professionals friends family clergyi know it doesnt have to last it wont personally my faith has made a huge difference in staying alive the past few years im also in therapy for emotional neglect and sexual abuse in my childhood i basically hate taking meds and end up falling off them every once in awhile then have to have the fall and then pita adjustment to taking them or a different one again
LifeProTips,not_removed,christmas day was my ultimate i felt negative left alone and not loved the next day it felt like all was just a dream and i was positive again how is this even possible
LifeProTips,not_removed,some people are born to live for themselves people like us were born to live for others a goal much more important and much more permanent society tends to forget but we are the elite few that know we shape the world keep on reminding them
LifeProTips,not_removed,i very much know that feeling youre describing you get tired of hearing about waiting because the stagnation youre in is so bitter and putrid i got so tired of waiting but now with all that being said i cannot properly convey how glad i am that i did not end my life the best advice i can offer is that a psychiatrist was the greatest help to me and id say switching to something else if whatever strategy youre using isnt helping its a frustrating process but keep at it ive been to plenty of therapists and counselors whom i didnt mesh with which is a major factor as far as im concerned when getting help so i simply went to another one or i tried a different treatment with the doctor whatever until it worked and it did
LifeProTips,not_removed,its been like that for three years for me kept doing my best which wasnt much without giving up but nothing seemed to improve today i feel good i could say that i love my life a few days ago the thing is keep doing the steps and it will improve in the end and i would have been the first to say thats bs its different for me a few months ago
LifeProTips,not_removed,when a man had nothing he was free
LifeProTips,not_removed,sure but you never know what will happen in the future things may or may not change but theres only one way to find out and id say its god damn worth the gamble to wait
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe your brains reward system is defect theres medication for that which might help
LifeProTips,not_removed,tfw you think the real lpt is always in the comments and this is the top comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought the sameand i still have moments where everything seems useless and i feel worthless but then i look around and notice i have gotten a lifei have worked hard and beat the shit out of depression so i can have everything i deserve cause i am not worthless and neither are you my thoughts are with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was slowly circling the drain for a while and didnt know what to do one thing that really helped was listening to psychology podcasts there was one in particular on itunes u called happiness from a professor at yale that really helped its about how being happy is at least partially a choice you make and describes strategies to build long lasting joy i recall building and maintaining healthy relationships was critical along with setting and achieving goals highly recommended for just about anyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,so true i used to fear death now i welcome it funny how that works when you have nothing left to live for
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had my fair share of bouts with depression but ive never been able to relate to people who choose suicide over living my father killed himself a few years ago but it was more along the lines of a situation that he got put in rather than a bout of depression i had an ex girlfriend who was always depressed i swear to god it was as if she became someome else once we moved in together and she was one with her bed after work because she hated life so much i always assume that this is what life is my life is this someone else has a different life people who live on the street especially during this time of the year i just dont get how they do it theyre much stronger than i am even if theyre drunk and out of their minds in order to do so being cold all the time would just be hell if youre depressed and willing to hurt yourself go get help no one wants you to do something that is permanent itll effect everyone youve ever met
LifeProTips,not_removed,i lived for my animals no one else would take them if i am gone not the old horses and mean goats so i got up to feed and water them they were my only reason for awhile then slowly it got better i worked as a health aide for a awhile it was a shitty job literally but i knew i was really needed so it helped quite a bit doing things for others who will appreciate it is quite therapeutic i used caps because you must not do this for anyone who wont it will just make it worse after a time i learned to appreciate my self again animals are great as they really bond to their caretaker and they show it for animal lovers it is the next best to social ties with humans
LifeProTips,not_removed,id be dead without my dogs no joke at all they give me purpose a reason to live i know exactly where you are coming from without them i am just me and thats pretty terrible
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had to go through three or four doctors before i found the right one its hard to keep pushing through medical bureaucracy but if you stick your guns and keep going back you will eventually get help it felt for years that no one would listen but in truth i feel i just needed a more intelligent doctor luckily i found one
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude try to find something you enjoy art can be a massive field movies books music games anime etc there has to be something you can get passionate about
LifeProTips,not_removed,having suffered from depression for years and it being gone for years now it does get better i would know

LifeProTips,not_removed,im very sorry to hear that apparently there a few hotlines and unfortunately in our day and age they seem to get busy if you ever get blue again please dont hesitate to pm me or try the hotline again you are loved
LifeProTips,not_removed,that sucks i called one time at years old and the guy said he didnt think i was serious and i was wasting his time even when i told him i had sleeping pills he wouldnt talk to me i took otc pills not to attempt suicide but just to sleep to make the pain go away for awhile i also had a psychiatrist write me a prescription for strong sleeping pills after i had been in therapy for depressionpost partum and the psychologist referred me to him for medicine i told him i had felt suicidal that was his solution more sleep i threw the scrip away and went to my md instead moral of the story keep trying even if the first person doesnt help you your value is great i dont want anyone to feel like this i reported a suicidal type post on fb earlier today and tried contacting the person it was on a news story i hope the woman is okay i emailed a few mutual acquaintances that we had but they havent responded yet
LifeProTips,not_removed,sadly a lot of help for depressed or suicidal people doesnt seem to actually help besides actual weekly therapy and sometimes drugs which are expensive and not easily available these hotlines can do more damage than not if you get the wrong person and it happens quite often people blast these hotlines numbers everywhere to look like theyre supportive without having to do the actual work themselves every thread every article every post always adds a quick if you or someone you knowcall this number its armchair activism at its finest lets be real if im suicidal and about to do it im not going to call a hotline im just gonna kill myself if im depressed or mentally ill but dont have my hand on the trigger yet im not gonna call a hotline due to anxiety or low self esteem because i think im not that bad especially when the hotline people say so suicidal or depressed people will continue to just suffer in silence instead of calling being suicidal is like a leper these days if you tell anyone they shut up avoid you and just call other people to come take you away if you tell a doctor yes ive thought about killing myself they clam up leave the room and then next thing you know youre being held involuntarily for hours if you tell a friend they avoid your because youre a downer and dont get me started on behavioural clinics or hospitals those people couldnt give a damn about you if you slit your wrists in front of them you are a price tag to them a number suicidal people need someone to reach out and listen instead of typing call this number on someones status ask them how they are doing and genuinely mean it talk to them notice them listen to them a large percent of hotline experiences are of people who felt worse after calling that percentage should be im sure whats happening is a lack of funding a lack of volunteers the volunteers themselves become bitter and jaded or the people who volunteer are forced to for school community service or to get a kick out of it and dont really care instead of copy and pasting a link to a hotline that you dont know for sure works or treats its callers why dont you offer your ear and time to those around you who are suffering instead of pushing them off on someone else source depressed anxious and suicidal for years and it aint going away been in behavioral hospitals involuntarily called hotlines reached out to friends etc there is a theme here for anyone else like me too
LifeProTips,not_removed,from experience if you arent planning on committing suicide right now or at least in the next hours then they generally want to move on from you asap still sometimes even that limited contact helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,i called one after my ex husband threw me down the stairs when i was young and naïve and i needed guidance on if i should stay and he told me he bets hell come home with a big bunch of flowers and apologise instead he tried to choke me ive avoided all hotlines since then
LifeProTips,not_removed,i also called the hotline for my ex the womans tone was very demanding almost bossy all she wanted was my location to send the police which i wasnt going to give ended up hanging up on her i can definitely see someone ending their life if shes the one they speak to as a last resort
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive never gotten anything but an answering machine im in a better place now much better but man that was close and it was almost the straw that broke the camels back
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive called different times and i swear its scripted to hell and back so disappointing
LifeProTips,not_removed,samaritan listening volunteer in the uk here ive seen a few posts from people who werent getting through and now that we have a freecall number it is getting harder to answer all of the calls we receive especially with the amount of people who abuse the service and clog up the line however we do really want to talk to you and we never prioritise callers depending on their situation if you are finding it difficult to get through i suggest that you give us a text or an email josamaritansorg if you include your number we will be able to give you a call back if you do want to talk on the phone
LifeProTips,not_removed,second that i have people who love me few but some all the same that isnt what i live for i find my whole life totally meaningless but i enjoy being an observer all the same i basically live to see people live and im happy with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,true happiness is subjective i know it sounds stupid but we need to find out what makes up happy im and dont know if ive ever been truly happy but damnit i keep going and trying i mean its only a simulation so im going to keep trying new things to find out
LifeProTips,not_removed,and equally not being loved doesnt equal unhappiness pretty sure no one loves me too much im ignored by all my relatives im sure some friends would be a little sad but no one will be heartbroken for me maybe ill find someone to marry someday but for right now im ok alone
LifeProTips,not_removed,for me it does
LifeProTips,not_removed,many people judge their worth based on how they are esteemed by others
LifeProTips,not_removed,im glad youre still here im glad you had your friend come to you i would go anywhere for my friends especially in these cases
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats cute unfortunately your last sentence only applies if you have already decided what success and mediocrity is maybe it is the definition of those you have to change i fucking hate standard life when not working i can lie in bed for days contenplating the meaninglessness of it all but it doesnt make me very sad because i know that at any point i can just take my shit and leave go out in the world leave everything if i really want to i know its up to me if you are unhappy change your environment it might get a bit lonely it might be tough but perhaps in that challange you will actually be happy
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes i wonder if my dad even gets me but somebody does you just need to reach out there is empathy in the world you just have to be able to reach out and accept it i love you and we are living in hell and heaven on earth its up to you
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not completely their fault though theyre not doing it out of spite for you but they run on scraps and are severely underfunded
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats funny how a suicide hotline shows how useless people are instead of helping only hearing stock music and then hanging the phone up should be one of the worst life experiences
LifeProTips,not_removed,they should play never gonna give you up when on hold but yeah that sucks they can only have so much resources tough every night before sleep i think about jumping from this mountain and if i were to stand there well i wouldnt have waited min
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey there where ever you are whatever timezone if you need to talk or want someone to sound off at call me i know a bit about how youre feeling right now i cant give you advice but i can listen i will pm you my number
LifeProTips,not_removed,i suggest downloading the cups app even while you wait for a listener it gives you exercises to calm down its really nice imo
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work in mental health please know that not all hotlines do this some do get very busy and some are run pretty poorly but for every bad hotline there are really good ones please dont be afraid to try again
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes it took like i dont know how many scrolls to see a post like this someone paid to care said something nice for you wow who knew
LifeProTips,not_removed,theyre usually volunteers but your point remains
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hear you i do believe i have found peace with loving myself others can be mean unreliable unjust and selfish but yourself you have to be your own best friend you have to know how to pep talk yourself into setting goals and accomplishing things so you can do what you want in life your friends your family your coworkers they are all people around you then there is you you should matter more to you than others i know this sounds selfish but its not about thatits about knowing what makes you happy getting it then others will want to be around you as they most likely show that they are happy but most likely battle issues with themselves being unhappy weather they know it or not im not saying become an alpha male douche bag im saying know how to keep yourself busy and happy doing things you like now i dont know anyones specific situation i have basically no friends or family and it is kind of sad that when i do set goals and accomplish things i have nobody to celebrate with buts thats why you have to be your own best friend learn about yourself and how to make yourself happy i have no problem celebrating alone as i know what i like doing for fun what am i doing for new years hanging out with people going to a bar no these things dont make me happy ill be at home by my self working on a project i have going maybe make an awesome meal maybe watch a moviegamei also like to find random stuff i have that is actually worth something but i dont need then post it on craigslist find someone who wants it and seems deserving i dont be a weirdo about it im just not going to help someone whos being a dick then i give it to them for free when they come to pick it up expecting to pay its always a nice transaction im not really losing anything i care about and everyone is happy gave out a set of oldbutstillgood winter tires today stupid shit like this is why i am happy i have learned to love myself and be my own best friend
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are not loved it is not because you arent worthy of it i dont know you but i love the idea of you and id feel terrible if i found out anything bad happened to you
LifeProTips,not_removed,the only person that ever has to love you is yourself thats where you have to start pick even the littlest things like how you express yourself and just appreciate thats what makes you who you are and nobody can change that
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel its a bit insincere to just say i love you with no previous interaction but i would like to talk to you pm me
LifeProTips,not_removed,go to the gym
LifeProTips,not_removed,im with you realizing the most important thing is to love yourself was eye opening
LifeProTips,not_removed,this hurts me because i love someone so dearly who thinks like this i just want him to know how much hes truly loved and i believe with my heart that someone feels the same about you im alone and crying myself right now and all i want is to be held but please know that there are people who are here for you i am
LifeProTips,not_removed,not sure its really in the spirit to tell someone you love them without knowing them not advising suicide but rather fulfillment
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love you for real its not even tangible i dont know you at all you might be a real piece of shit irl but right here right now im letting you know that i have nothing but love for you please talk to us or call the hotline even if you dont think we love you we still care
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel the exact same way i never felt loved then i had this partner of sorts that made me feel loved for a while then she left to find someone better and now im back at square one i just learned to accept that some people dont deserve love oh well
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not that bad love might be a bit overrated its really only mean people or bad experiences with people that bother me i usually tell them up yours or flip them the bird or something as long as theres no regrets about whatever im doing like a hobby or something fun then im pretty happy if you get bored or tired or bothered then you could always try a new hobby or activity nothing lost i think everyone should find something to enjoy living even something as simple as spending time on reddit or playing games or working out
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love you i truly do you have great worth someday you will see that i promise im so proud of you for reaching out and posting this i know how hard it is even anonymously
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not mega into doctor who but i did watch a season or so of it there is one episode where doctor who explains that the common average man is the most important thing in existence iirc in the episode this dude had his timeline changed and was stuck in an eternal loop he went on to explain basically that you are apart of this world and this universe and you play a role whether it actually is a role or not you are a pillar in reality holding it up you are important idc if youre an addict a felon a lawyer the president a janitor whatever you are important and you are part of this universe on a related note ive taken quite a few life lessons from laveyan satanism and here is one that applies you are god you are a reflection of god you are in control of your reality and your universe maybe not in all literal aspects but you have influence and you have power the most wonderful thing in the world is in your control your life be the beautiful god that you are and appreciate that time you have in this life in this experience i know you know this but death is inevitable you make the choice to live everyday and you should enjoy that choice the old adage that life is short is true so dont be in a rush to bring the inevitable try new things stop and appreciate small things every now and again every single thing you do is a choice and when you realize that i promise you will realize you can choose to make things better choose to do what you want and choose to be happy in the time it takes you to learn these things im here for you the other people in this thread are here for you we love you and we want you to prosper
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think the thing is that love for people who feel chronically unloved is a very deep and meaningful emotion something thats so special you cant possibly share it with many people because of that i cant say i love you like i love my girlfriend but i see the potential of the person you could be even if i have never met you i can tell that youre torn apart by your emotions that hurts me on a personal level because i know how that feels and i think itd be hurtful to the world if it lost another person with your potential in the end it comes to this i believe that despite everything all people are ultimately born good and happy and i believe that everyone should have the tools necessary to be good and happy it makes me sad that not everyone gets to live the life that they want i love the person that i envision you would be if you were given that chance
LifeProTips,not_removed,is it my heart breaks for people that experience tragedies it may not be love by they are in my thoughts and i feel for them it makes me genuinely sad for them and if i could talk to them i would you may not feel that way because whatever situation you are in youve lost the ability to be emphatic but i can tell you there are people that care maybe love is too strong a word but they do care
LifeProTips,not_removed,look i have never even heard of your existence chances are that we dont even live on the same continent and still im just going to assume that you are a likeable person and even if youre not i still wish you the best im not lying to you i like and respect you because you didnt give me any reason not to and it also makes me feel better liking someone goes both ways so even if you dont believe me i hope everything you try succeeds and you are as happy as possible happy new year
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know the post was serious and meant well but i could only think about this so thanks for posting
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love it very talented
LifeProTips,not_removed,very talented
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree i think its improperly worded i think its better to say that you do have value even though it sometimes feels that you dont
LifeProTips,not_removed,it reminds me of this warning its cringey and probably very demotivating to many but if one is feeling like shit and talks about heshe might hear some of the cliche answers that feel so repetitive
LifeProTips,not_removed,meh there are some things worse than death sometimes thats living
LifeProTips,not_removed,im also open to talk if anyone needs someone whos been there and pulled through
LifeProTips,not_removed,it creates more for us living this sounds like a positive to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,nice guilt trip no one should reply to you i can imagine why they killed themselves now
LifeProTips,not_removed,came here to give them a shoutout see you on the platform
LifeProTips,not_removed,this this is my life
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,for some people hearing you are loved from a stranger can be comforting because they havent heard it from anyone else or at least havent heard it in a very long time knowing that someone out there on this big bluey green rock flying through space will take a few minutes out of their day to focus on you specifically to try and make you feel loved and appreciated even if you know its not real love it can mean a lot to someone
LifeProTips,not_removed,well bud if it means anything i dont believe in hell and i dont think you should either but dont end your life pm me if you wanna talk
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is so terrible this would destroy me in the past i have considered calling one of those hotlines but after reading this thread probably wont
LifeProTips,not_removed,this might sound crazy but try literally anything else first i mean if youre going to kill yourself anyway you can afford to take a huge risk to try and improve your life think of whats making you miserable if its an actual thing going on in your life or something internal and try to change it the closer you are to killing yourself the more drastic means you can use to improve your situation i felt the same way you did i always assumed that one day after years of idle suicidal thoughts and tendencies id lose control and go through with it one day i just left my old life behind completely and started over pretty much from the ground up and ive been doing much better since try anything and everything first pm me if you need someone to talk to
LifeProTips,not_removed,have you ever wondered whether love matters i mean you can find study after study showing the importance of love for children etc etc but do you care i dont think love is what i live for i live to observe basically i like watching the world go by no matter whats going on its not to say i feel emotionless watching it all but that its just unchangeable and that it might as well just be a big reality tv show my advice is dont hedge your bets on when youll go over the edge just roll with it and ffs if you havent see a psychiatrist i didnt want to take drugs for a long time drugs make me happy to go on no matter how meaningless it all is
LifeProTips,not_removed,im so sorry to hear that you feel this state is inevitable everyone is loveable sometimes its so hard to see through the dark clouds but trust me you are worthy just the way you are out of curiousity were you reaching out over social media or a doctor or therapist unfortunately friends sometimes arent there where we need them but talking to someone who knows more about this stuff would be a great step and they hopefully would take your feelings very seriously all the best
LifeProTips,not_removed,especially when youve nearly forgotten your first few calls and get the courage up to try again only to be met with the same crappy script and annoyed operators acting like you shouldnt have bothered them
LifeProTips,not_removed,us httpssuicidepreventionlifelineorg another httpwwwcrisistextlineorgtextline lots of hotlines there
LifeProTips,not_removed,google should let you know your area or countrys crisis line
LifeProTips,not_removed,my advice if youd like it is to find another psychiatrist and be clear with them that youre looking to confirm your diagnosis and start over if they think its different pay them out of pocket if you have tocan its cheaper than a psych ward it took me a while and i found it in a way i never thought i would i wouldnt get along with the guy outside of the appointments my mom has to pay for me to see him because he doesnt take medicare and i know im fortunate in that but it helped me immensely hes not and doesnt act like a therapist and i didnt want a therapist he just explains the facts to me and i appreciate that immensely if nothing else he gave me confirmation that everything happening to me was a physical observable occurrence in the brain the meds helped too its not perfect but its better to be happy and anxious than unhappy and anxious on top of that hes not pushy about meds he knows changing meds causes me to have panic attacks so every time i end up calling him to say im scared of this medication he tells me he thinks im just having a panic attack and that its up to me whether i carry on taking it some have given me the same side effects youre talking about especially remeron and he didnt pressure me to carry on
LifeProTips,not_removed,then my best friend who apparently wasnt enjoying the cursed child all that much called me back and talked to me for four hours till i was better saved by jk rowlings bland writing
LifeProTips,not_removed,knowing that tons of people want to kill themselves just reaffirms my belief that life truly is shitty and pointless
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i waited far too long to see a psychiatrist and get myself on the right meds honestly i feel it contributed to the seriousness of my illness because i had such a slow spiral down to where i ended up with one anxiety disorder appearing after another likely because i wasnt diagnosed or treated for bipolar while in a tricky situation i guess it took realizing i had literally no other option and had to do something and it still took longer after that to really process my lack of options what i try to remind people is that if theyre asking for help then they think theyre out of options but there is still that option its just not on their minds in the worst of times and not something they like the idea of at their best at their worst with a reminder theyll take the leap its so crushing to see when people are in serious trouble and still dont want to and ive seen it several times i dont blame them i understand why but it hurts to see them dealing with something they dont necessarily have to i think part of the problem is the misconception that the meds are a silver bullet people dont buy that and at the same time theyre not bothered if it isnt a silver bullet im not fixed because im on meds and i even have unpleasant side effects my anxiety disorders havent even been affected by meds they beat out the alternative by a mile though so to me i owe all the happiness i have to them
LifeProTips,not_removed,great reply i always stumble upon my words when i want to describe to people that change in mood starts with themselves it sounds so cliche people really take life for granted believe life should suit them but i have no idea on how to get them to understand that the little box they live in does not define their life
LifeProTips,not_removed,ugh you know its nice im not the only one drinking loneliness during the holidays
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are not unlikeable we are not all a perfect fit and there are people you like that dont like you but there are also people that like you that you dont like things go both ways heres a reason to be alive find something to smile about until you can do that you have a reason to be alive no one can tell you how your year will go but i can give you a hint it goes only as you want it to bad things will come no matter what but those are only trying to cloud your vision of a better year sometimes they are too strong and they win but it doesnt have to be that way im proud of you for making it this long and im always here if you want to talk
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre in no way unlikable ive spent many years feeling alone and beyond help you will meet better people i promise you i have no idea who you are but im here for you x
LifeProTips,not_removed,its sad that some people cant live on without a stranger telling the they shouldnt off themselves
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow thats a load of bullshit do you have any understanding of depression or is this your best armchair psychiatry people become actively suicidal quickly they can be short periods a few hours and you might still want to die but youre past the dangerous point you might do it its proven to work you are full of shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,that sucks a big bag of dicks man its not your fault you deserve much better than that do you have friends or other people that you can talk to in this time
LifeProTips,not_removed,think about the epileptic dogs
LifeProTips,not_removed,hello umrgrowpro thank you for your comment unfortunately your comment has been removed for the following reasons your comment has been removed for being abusiveinsulting if you would like to appeal this decision httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetorlifeprotips do not repost without explicit permission from the moderators make sure you rlifeprotipsaboutsidebar before submitting thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,no that would be a great way to discourage people from seeking help
LifeProTips,not_removed,better than a suppository
LifeProTips,not_removed,some clinics offer discounts and various pay scales there are free clinics as well and hell if youre suicidal and truly need help the emergency room is there source am an er nurse
LifeProTips,not_removed,name checks out
LifeProTips,not_removed,just curious about the way i was taking it would you care to elaborate in case it might be helpful to others
LifeProTips,not_removed,deleted
LifeProTips,not_removed,but its your choice to browse its not like rwholesomememes is approaching you telling you to get better or smile its nice to browse when im in a foul mood to see some good content that i know wont make me more disgusted with humanity
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey i did that too and i was pretty accepting that being pretty damn depressed was just my life it wasnt too great anyway things flipped around for me with unusually little effort on my part since id have never put it in and im genuinely happy for the first time in a long while i can really see how wrong i was and i hope you get the same realisation soon happy new year friend i hope its good to you
LifeProTips,not_removed,my new years resolution right here
LifeProTips,not_removed,do you have love its more important than getting love
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes happiness comes not from other people loving you but from you loving and caring for others be it humans or beast
LifeProTips,not_removed,noone should ever be unloved i love you from one reddit strangerfriend to another i absolutely love you
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are loved just not looking in the right places dont know if religion is an option for you but god can help bring joy in your life there is a community that love to love others give it a chance what else you got to lose
LifeProTips,not_removed,for real man sometimes the biggest smile and happyness in my day comes from seeing their super happy face as soon as i grab the leash for walks literally bolts up like d when i was super low i rescued the first one she was years old i told myself this is a year lease on life you cannot let bad things happen to you or do bad things to yourself because literally nobody else would look after this beautiful loving animal for you then a couple of years later i got another one so that they could play but more so to be like i am committed to this girl that i am dating and she wanted a puppy and maybe that will show her i am committed to her for year or more month later she stonewalls me and i am left to raise the puppy now hes years old every time i look at him i cannot help but think of my love for her thats a little rough sometime but again now the best solution would be to give them up to better homes because i am in a really bad place financially and the apartment wants pet rentmonth but selfishly i keep them because well she gave me a year lease on life and i love them both
LifeProTips,not_removed,and if you cant afford to talk to a professional what if it all comes down to having no money and working all the time and barely having time to take care of yourself i mean is being depressed really the same as living a depressing life and just crawling through miles of shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,its easy saying that it will get better but i have tried therapy meds extersice you name it but still every day of my life the last years has been worse then the previous
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know this isnt kosher to say but honestly go away no not all problems are to be treated with a doctor and a pill no it is normal to feel despair in certain environments people often get consumed but that is another matter im going to be honest with you i have a lot of experience in the mental health industry from both the side of the treated and as a professional and large numbers of my family are involved as well i dont know anything about you personally but not everyone in here has experienced what you have or thinks it is a barrier in their lives today or lets it consume them i often hear sentiments like this from people that need drugs or religion or whatever it is to get them up in the morning ultimately if that works for you then have at it but dont encourage others to go down the same path of your delusion if you have to do so on faith ive seen people play along only to always have that nagging feeling in the bag of their minds this isnt right it can be euphoric when you decide to stop dwelling on problems even if that is really just a form of nihilism everything is fine it doesnt matter anyway just live everyday personally i think there is a fine line between classical enlightenment and nihilism anyway i dont mean to attack you even though i suppose i did or put you down or discourage others and i know you mean well but i dont think its appropriate to do what youre doing to be clear its not that the advise to seek help when appropriate is wrong or bad not at all but if you are trying to convince people that they can put off their life problems and just take a pill and that everything is just fine then i have an issue with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have been smoking practically every day for years now i am thinking maybe it is time to stop even though it does help short term long term i could really use some of the tens of thousands i spent on weed through out the years today
LifeProTips,not_removed,if im quite honest i was coming down from a mushroom trip and well i kinda turned into emotional playdoh the operator just didnt understand how to help which is understandable thank you for the kind words
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey not sure if its covered in the comments already but depending on where you are there are different services and some of them are great im an aussie and we have some top notch ones anyway if youre down under and want to say gday pm me my family and i are pretty friendly and not the worst listeners in the world happy new year
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel like this is how it is for a lot of people unfortunately sometimes the people in the other side of the line are people who are just trying to get paid and not someone who wants to help the best thing i can offer is that even if it feels like no one cares trust me someone cares if the suicide hotline isnt too hot in your area check out rsuicidewatch or rdepression great subs with some great people who know whats up
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not a lawyer but can someone legalminded please explain to me if a suicide hotline staff can ever be sued in tort civil law for contributory negligence if they ignored a call which they deemed unimportant and a person actually committed suicide if placed under an objective test or reasonable persons test it would have found the initial suicide caller needed careful attention but was whisked away under criminal prosecution can the da or crown if commonwealth jurisdiction charge the suicide hotline company specifically for negligence as well against the hotlineperson who declined to offer help will there ever be a case for causation in manslaughter due to an omission to administer proper help i always thought those placed in important roles have some sort of responsibility to offer proper help and not ignore it when it comes knocking edit grammar
LifeProTips,not_removed,its genius reasoning though he cant suicide when hes sleeping better make sure he only sleeps all day
LifeProTips,not_removed,exercise helped me get over my depression i was sleeping too much and i had no motivation last year i was hundreds of miles away from any family i was on my own jobless homeless and i was trying to find my own way now im back in my hometown going to college i have a job im trimming down and getting back into shape i have quite a few ambitions getting back into sports programming for a living etc and exercise was the key to that that and eating right
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess he was going the andrea from walking dead route with suicide that makes no sense to me that he wouldnt take it seriously seems like thats like rule of the job
LifeProTips,not_removed,and dont get me started on behavioural clinics or hospitals they made my depression as a teen worse fuck them they lie about how much therapyin reality its once a week an hour of group therapy and every two weeks or less one on one therapythey will provide how often the psychiatrist would comebarely once every two weeks more like once a month and how long theyd keep you for of the time youre sitting there doing nothing because they dont allow anything from outside including books for at least two weeks and you cant have things like pencils to even write and pass the time whatever you do dont go to a goddamned hospital or clinic its hell
LifeProTips,not_removed,well written
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you tell a friend they avoid your because youre a downer i learned to stop telling anyone i know that im depressed after i lost two of them for this reason id tried to kill myself and fucked it up told them about itand a week later theyre coming up with all kinds of excuses not to talk to me i got the message and stopped bothering them the time after that was probably the darkest period in my life but holy shit it made me appreciate my one friend who did stick by me after id talked to him about it multiple times so much more i dont want things to get weird so i dont gush to him or anything but the way i see it hes the direct cause of my continued existence
LifeProTips,not_removed,id like to ask a serious question that is in no way judgmental but i am very curious if you have been depressed and suicidal for years and you feel its not going away why havent you done it by now there is something that keeps you hanging on what is it could you grasp that thread and let it lead you to a place where youre not in constant anguish
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a volunteer for a suicide hotline that genuinely does it out of interest and empathy im so sorry youve had negative experiences with them i can say from my perspective that most volunteers i have met and spoken with we volunteer remotely from our homes so i only have online contact seem to genuinely want to help and support those who need us the best we can one thing that is frustrating for those reaching out to us im sure but that there isnt much we can do in terms of helping is that many people have very valid reasons for feeling the way they do i am not saying depression and anxiety with no root cause is not valid but that many times people can identify why they are feeling the way they feel and are looking for solutions but unfortunately there is not much we can do over the phone if for instance youve just lost your job are in danger of losing your home are coping with a rocky marriage and recently relocated so you have no close friends those are all incredibly valid reasons to be feeling so hopeless and lost and many are looking for ways to solve these problems but those are such huge hurdles to be battling that an hour on the phone cant solve them all i can do is listen let you vent to me and suggest some things to help you relax for the night sometimes we can action plan with you and help you identify some goals and map out steps to achieve them but not all problems fit nicely into the scale so while im doing my absolute best to be the person you need me to be i understand why you dont want to be told to take a hot shower listen to some music write in a journal or reach out to a friend odds are youve already done those things and they havent helped you so youre moving on to the next step but without knowing your history your personality your lifestyle your friends and family and the nuances of the city in which you live i cant really offer constructive advice because what worked for me or for others may be impossible where you are what im trying to say i suppose is that odds are most people you interact with via these lines really do genuinely care but are struggling to know how best to support you as well and i know when youve been coping with something for so long and tried so many things that dont seem to work reaching out to a line and ultimately not feeling any better is frustrating and pulls you down farther we end up seeming like people who dont really care and just another failure in trying to help a lot of these organizations were formed by those friends who stuck by someone as they worked through some of the darkest periods of their life but we cant be that close connection for total strangers no matter how badly we want to be that makes absolutely no excuse for lines that have told you that you dont matter or your problems werent big enough that is bullshit and i cant defend that but from my own experience it seems like and i hope it is an example of a couple bad eggs in a good bunch i wish you the best and feel free to pm me if youd like more information or just want to chat im here
LifeProTips,not_removed,people tend to forget that some people make the choice out of pure logic no amount of wishy washy good feels and hotlines is going to fix it it needs real help
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have been one of those people who send someone a hotline number and nothing more and ive also been one to listen and ask about their life for several minutes kinda made me think about some choices ive made and how i might have gotten more jaded or more apathetic towards people hopefully on ill be able to improve on that
LifeProTips,not_removed,well in my case i told him i had the pills in my hand he told me i just wanted attention and that i wasnt seriouswhich is pretty much the opposite of what you tell someone who is suicidal
LifeProTips,not_removed,i volunteered for one before and that wasnt the case for us at all when someone just wanted to chat because they were lonely we were told to try to make sure they were going to be okay and had some self care plans and try to keep that kind of check in call to around minutes i could see it being different if the line was swamped though i guess
LifeProTips,not_removed,i volunteer on a line every shift i speak to regulars sometimes they get other times they get it depends how busy the line is that night there is often just of us on shift covering countries it also depends how im feeling wrongly or rightly i might have just had a harrowing call or regulars in a row telling me their story again i might gave had the same caller times in a row i might have had a regular caller giving me shit for not helping them enough on the previous call it happens were just people if you call and youre in crisis you get as long as you need or want to talk about your situation if your not in crisis but youre sufferingwanting to explore how youre feeling about the world youll get as long as you need within reason where i think the call is helping you we can usually tell when the person is finished talking about the present issue thats chewing you all lines are different and all call listeners are different thats basically how i run my shift within the operational policies of my organisation
LifeProTips,not_removed,holy shit that operator couldve and probably has gotten someone fucking killed thats fucking awful
LifeProTips,not_removed,well that was fuckign stupid of them im so sorry and hope youre in a better place in your life now hotlines arent supposed to give advice so im surprised this one did
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow the frightening thing is he mightve done and it wouldnt be better in the slightest
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh im so sorry to hear that i volunteer in another capacity at a dv shelter and i know that ours are really great people have to call them directly though not through the local hotline i think they dont threaten to call the police or anything ive called a local hotline for another situation not dv or suicide and both times i got great help including offering to call me back which i was fine with on the next day with one of their certified counselors they got me into classes for awhile that helped
LifeProTips,not_removed,i volunteer on one i can assure ours isnt remotely scripted we are trained to follow a basic model to the call but otherwise its just you and i you and i might not have a decent chemistry to feed a conversation i might not have the right words at that moment to make you feel safe enough to share i might not have the right thoughts to give the space youre looking for for your thoughts i might not be very experienced or frankly any good im just a person its you and me i want to help you its why i do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe its a dumb suggestion but try finding a little hobby that allows you to see the progress you make how much better you get over time playing an instrument would be perfect i bought a guitar months ago started reading guitar for dummies and i can play all the basic chords and a couple of my favourite songs it wont fix all your problems which i honestly dont know but maybe learning new stuff and making constant progress can be therapeutic
LifeProTips,not_removed,if happiness is subjective then why do you say that being loved doesnt equate to being happy for some people its exactly that when someone loves me unconditionally i feel great because i have commitments issues and i have never had the feeling that i mattered so when someone looks at me with pure love in their eyes and tells me how much i mean to them the void is temporarily filled its no permanent solution but to believe i am worthwhile i first needed someone close to me to treat me that way
LifeProTips,not_removed,also depends on if you love yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,no matter how far you go you can never get away from yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like that thought it is comforting in its strength i suppose but someone also said no matter how far you go you can never get away from yourself which is the other side of that battle heres to working on that hard in
LifeProTips,not_removed,you would think that they would at least put in the effort to put thought into how their onhold message will be perceived i dunno what the message was but if it was something like the standard we are experiencing an above average number of calls and we apologise for the delay then thats kinda crap for a suicide hotline
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds like theyre severely understaffed and underfunded im sure you could volunteer or donate
LifeProTips,not_removed,my psychologist is paid to care but she does my doctor is paid to care ive known him since i was four pretty sure he cares a little payment doesnt make the things they say less valuable unless they tell you they dont care and are only in it for money
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre such a good person doing this i wil definitely try this aswell
LifeProTips,not_removed,i remember reading on reddit somewhere that youre the only person youre going to spend the rest of your life with friendsfamilylovers may move on or pass away but youll always be there with you make sure youre someone that you want to spend the rest of your life with
LifeProTips,not_removed,you sound like someone i would like as a friend keep rocking
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you this is exactly what i needed to read today tonight will be my first new years staying in and to be completely honest im excited
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would love to be friends with someone like you i hope you do find people to be friends with as you continue to spread your kindness
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are into heavy reading i could recommend max stirners the ego and its own
LifeProTips,not_removed,bullshit
LifeProTips,not_removed,its because it is this thread is full of people typing ily then patting themself on the back cuz they are such good people and are helping others when in reality it changes nothing
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol seeing like ily comments end with this was a little funny
LifeProTips,not_removed,not for everyone find an escape something to exert energy dont let it build up inside of you we are energy the soul you have is electricity
LifeProTips,not_removed,this shit right here helps lifting really allows yourself to take your mind off all the negative
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know you mean well but this just feels so meaningless to me when people on the internet say this to me i know its not true so it almost has the opposite effect im so sorry for saying this when i know you mean well
LifeProTips,not_removed,what a load of shit you cant love somebody that you know nothing about that doesnt even make sense its people like you that do the whole youre special and i love you even though youre a complete stranger shit that makes me hate humanity even if you did truly love them and you dont because you dont even know him what good does it do oh thank god im loved by some random fucker on the internet that has no bearing on my meaningless existence life is worth living its a selfserving load of crap so you can sit there and feel good about saying some nice but ultimately meaningless words to some random guy youre never going to speak to again
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love you no you dont youd help a lot more people if your words werent empty i dont care how many times you try to deny it so you get more karma you dont love someone who you just saw a few lines on the internet from
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love you too
LifeProTips,not_removed,the fuck is wrong with all you people throwing that word around you dont know them you dont love them youre not gonna make anything better youll just make it worse because they know you dont actually mean it
LifeProTips,not_removed,having value and being appreciated for said value are two very different things if the people you once trusted kicked you to the curb and treated you less than human what does it ultimately matter youre homeless alone broke lost almost all of your family lost everything oh right but i have value thank the gods at least i have that useless metric to base my life on
LifeProTips,not_removed,heshe might hear some of the cliche answers that feel so repetitive its not that theyre repetitive its that theyre not really meaningful those stock phrases dont help the majority of depressed people if all they needed was to be told it will get better then we wouldnt have antidepressants or therapists as things people pay money for
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes that sure feels like its true i have to live to believe that it can or will get better i have to believe that but sometimes life does make that impossible to believe
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always go back to the interviews with the people who have survived jumping off the golden gate bridge they all said they had this moment of clarity as they jumped that everything in their life was fixable except the thing theyd just done
LifeProTips,not_removed,with no sarcasm meant i wish i were one of those people
LifeProTips,not_removed,while i love the idea of universalism the concept of hell oddly keeps me alive im not sure why i post these things maybe some weird kind of catharsis from shouting into the void maybe because it actually kind of hurts to see people tell others that things will be okay when sometimes that is really flatly false living isnt valuable by itself life in pain is no life theres a reason we euthanize animals who are suffering
LifeProTips,not_removed,drugs didnt do aaaaanything at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,of all the people who like to say that harry potter saved their lives i guess i have a pretty legitimate claim 😂
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hope youre right thank you this really means something to me x i am here too
LifeProTips,not_removed,i do thank you so much just for caring
LifeProTips,not_removed,the er is significantly more costly without insurance than therapy
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes meds mixed with other medicationswine or any alcoholtobacco not enough sleep daily etc can do wierd things this is often why doctors will have a follow up visit shortly after prescribing new medsto make sure youre not the one rare individual to have your skin fall off or somthing an actual side effect of one epilepsy medication out there
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my case i was skipping my placebo week ive done this in the past with no issues and was actually prescribed this new birth control because it was better suited for that my old one would still give me break through bleeding and cramps at the end of the month especially after skipping two months in a row the new one low ogestel effectively stopped them and i honestly cant remember the last time i had a period i know i skipped a couple months without issues and then the guy i was seeing moved away in late september so i attributed my downturn in mood to that and by the end of october i was already so down that i didnt want to fuss with a period so it got so bad that i dont even really remember much of november or december i went to work and school but cant tell you what i accomplished there i did somehow manage to finally graduate with my masters but stayed in bed crying for two days after i made a few regrettable attempts to reach out to someone toxic in my past and obsessed about him a lot and that desire to reconnect with him disappeared within a day of stopping my pill i did a few other things i dont really remember doing toward the end of it and certainly cant explain now that im thinking clearly again
LifeProTips,not_removed,my friends are in pharmaceuticals i was having a rough time with a generic bc and she told me that generics just need to be within a certain range of hormone which could mean that youre getting more than you would have with your original prescription and that it could fluctuate i hate that i let it fuck with me for so long went name brand and lower hormone and better now
LifeProTips,not_removed,but its your choice to browse its not like rwholesomememes is approaching you telling you to get better or smile yes i understand that all im saying is that this place isnt a magical solution for me to get better and i had people recommending it to me so it kinda is approaching me i was stating my own opinion nothing else
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant say that i have put in unusually little effort i have tried more or less everything and all that is left is just wating for it to go away or me just getting enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,this relates to my situation very closely time changes things you can not force it happy new year to all
LifeProTips,not_removed,love for what another person then no because i have no one close in my life and i hate everything about who i am as a person how i look and my personality
LifeProTips,not_removed,and who should i care about the ppl i walk by on the street an will never see again im not close to my parents cuz they have the stamceller that im just feeling sorry for myself and should snap out of it i have no friends cuz a few years of beeing shut in kinda makes ppl ignore that you exsist i dont have any pets and i cant get any either since they are not allowed where i live
LifeProTips,not_removed,even if you think they would be better off with someone other than you that may not be the case they need you they love you someone else might be more financially set than you but as long as you can provide them food shelter and health care please keep them dogs give you the love you need to survive and as i can tell by their reactions to you you do the same for them it would break their little hearts especially the rescue to lose the person whow loves them its not selfish of you to keep them its selfless hopefully that association with your ex will fade and not make you sad anymore
LifeProTips,not_removed,i realized after a long time that i just wasnt allowing myself time to work on myself always making an excuse for why i couldnt i needed something to hold onto that would give me hope for me it was viewing the sunrise daily i stopped staying up all night and forced myself awake during the day some zombie days and beautiful sunrises later i was different change something anything you can have hope it gets better
LifeProTips,not_removed,life is always changing life comes in phases you may feel like youre just living a depressing life and sometimes thats the reality you just have to stick it out until things start to change again take the opportunities when they arise and the next phase may be better until then try out meditating it can be as simple as just sitting with your eyes closed and focusing on your breathing being able to identify your thoughts as things that just pass through your head instead of seeing your thoughts as who you are is a great way to identify negative thoughts and let go of them also get outside if you can exercise and diet play a huge role in your mood and outlook on life
LifeProTips,not_removed,there are usually free forms of therapy in cities if you look them up i found a group for those with anxiety that meets every week near where i live and it helped me since i couldnt afford therapy
LifeProTips,not_removed,well you can talk to me im no professional but maybe it helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you arent happy then i think therapy is probably the best use of your money money is money and work is work they are meaningless if you arent happy a therapist can teach you how to be happy with what you have and give you the tools you need to go where you want to go in life and most will work with your budget therapy is an investment in the future quality of your life
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats been my philosophical issue as well is there a pill you can take that fixes all the depressing aspects of your life
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hope you dont mind me butting in do you think you could come up with a small simple thing that is under your control that you could do tomorrow that would make it better im talking simplelike get a special coffeehave a favorite sandwich for lunchgo to a movie think about that come up with somethinganything that improves tomorrow if even the smallest amount you dont have to escalate but differentiatedo small different things baby steps good luck bud
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont worry man this isnt forever put on dark side of the moon and look up at the sky
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre ever in that situation again visit httpstripsitme that site is designed to talk to people who are on drugs and need to talk to someone
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude thats hilarious still good on you to call
LifeProTips,not_removed,i lost my personality on mushrooms one time i was perfectly aware of how i had behaved and felt about things in the past but i had no instinctive sense of how to respond to things happening in the now i couldnt access my sense of humor or any other subjective feelings about what was going on around me it was fascinating if a bit disorienting that feeling of is this weird change going to be forever can be hard to counter while youre inside the trip an aside ive never understood why people tend to take mushrooms less seriously than acid ive had way more fuckedup trips on mushrooms than i have on acid
LifeProTips,not_removed,well heres a little life pro tip dont take psychedelics they interfere with the balance of the neurotransmitters in the synaptic spaces of your brain lsd in particular mimics the biochemical conditions present in schizophrenia amateur fucking around with the chemistry of your brain is a bad idea im just sayin of course a shit ton of space cadets disagree with me
LifeProTips,not_removed,there really needs to be a im scary high and need help hotline maybe i just found my calling in life
LifeProTips,not_removed,usually suicide hotlines are non profit also a good way to get community service hours done but thats probably an even greater level of i dont care
LifeProTips,not_removed,not a lawyer either but id reckon keeping as few call logs or recordings possible is clearly in the interests of preserving as little liability as possible for any suicide hotline id imagine
LifeProTips,not_removed,im irish in ireland no they cannot sue it was deemed that the ability to sue someone who was trying to help was preventing volunteers from offering assistance so they are now protected by law only if the person commits a very gross act tells you to take an unprescibed medicine encourages suicide are they liable telling a caller no certainly wouldnt hold you responsible
LifeProTips,not_removed,not a lawyer but im a law graduate in the uk its very difficult to sue someone like this i believe the issue here would be of causation the court would firstly ask would the person have committed suicide anyway without the hotline staff members involvement which frankly is a question in itself and would require careful analysis of the situation as a whole and consideration of the staff members involvement as a whole the question would be whether what they did is a significant contributing factor to the persons death it does not have to be the only cause or the main cause but significant the reasonable man test basically holds that if you were some random guy who found out about all this would you feel the suicide hotline staff is at fault however as the staff member would be a professional shehe would likely fall under the professionals test same as above except they are held to the standard of a professional so the question is whether a staff member in their place would have done the same thing in a case like this even from a legal point of view its also important to take regard of the circumstances was this a young teen who was vulnerable and needed an adult to talk to and was shunned which tipped them over the edge who is the victim and what were their circumstances although you can argue that a staff member of a suicide hotline should be trained and equipped to deal with all kinds of people so its difficult and there are a lot of factors to consider but it may be possible i wouldnt rule anything out someone correct me if im wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think they can be considered negligent just because someone called them asking for help if you call the cops and they answer but do not respond to your situation they are not considered negligent there is a story i read recently about a girl who crashed her car and called the cops for help they answered the call but no one else reported a crashed car in the area so the cops did not follow up on her call and she ended up dying the dispatcherpolice department was not found to be negligent doctors are in a different category i think doctors can get in trouble for not reporting certain suicidal signs like if the patient has a date or method planned out
LifeProTips,not_removed,not a lawyer either but i think claims related to suicide vary from state to state some states see it as the person who killed themselves responsibility to not kill themselves regardless assuming the worker didnt actually intend to make the situation worse other states might fault them because they could be seen as incompetent or something like that and couldnt be responsible for themselves
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah if that was how it worked i can think of sleeping scrips i have now im fine now decades later that could easily be killer ironic that ive never considered them as possible lethal weapons till now
LifeProTips,not_removed,is there anything else you wouldnt mind sharing about how exactly you got into exercise and how it helped your mood ive struggled with depression for a long time and have many exerciseistheanswer advocates in my life butim dubious i played sports and worked out every day in high school and thats when i was most depressed ive always been someone who absolutely hates exercise even if i do it for months with consistency and all that and im pretty naturally athletic and not overweight or anything so i feel like im doing something wrong and not getting these positive effects everyone else does
LifeProTips,not_removed,im glad that worked out for you it doesnt work for everyone or even for many i think each of our brains are circuited enough differently that certain influences or circumstances make it harder for a lot of people to do what you have done i bet they can do things easier than others can in other ways exercise really is great but its not that simple no matter how simple it sounds on paper i mean after all we all know how to walk right we all know what is healthy for us too it justdoesnt click for everyone i am glad it clicked for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,im probably the only one in the us besides my husband that doesnt know what that means andrea youd think the doctor who handed me the loaded gun so to speak the sleeping pill prescription in so you know it was strong crap was an older man very dismissive and i only met with him once maybe he had a problem with my referring counselor same practice though but why take it out on me i was a wreck and i let it all out maybe he had an ex he hated that looked me or something doesnt excuse him or the hotline counselor who basically dared me to do it yall are the only people who know about the hotline counselor
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive only been in two different clinic but there always seems to be a theme they lie to you to get you in there then fucking disappear promised therapy within the first hours dont get it until day group therapy is just some woman saying that depression is all in your mind and that her mother dying from cancer was worse than what youre going through if you sleep in or dont eat much they lie to your family and say youre more depressed than they thought and combative i cant stress enough they do not actually offer you help in terms of helping your depression or therapy in there theyll put you in pills immediately and then forget about you no therapy no daily talks nothing a lot of people who are put into clinics involuntarily by their wellintentioned push it off on someone else friends and family feel like it makes their depression worse yes it works in the fact that you can no longer kill your self as long as you are there because they take and keep everything away from you but the abuse from the employees the apathy from the doctors and the lack of control and compassion really really fucks with the patients admitted putting your loved one in a psych hospital is a bad bad idea once again lend an ear and talk instead of pawning them off on someone else
LifeProTips,not_removed,half of its bullshit but whatever i work in hospitals and clinics all throughout my state and the nurses and doctors who care for patients hell even the administration staff are far and beyond more caring than the average joe this kid is likely just projecting and blaming his circumstances on the world around him
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont want things to get weird so i dont gush to him or anything does it make you sad that you cant really tell your closest friends how you really feel because you know it would make them uncomfortable you dont want them to be uncomfortable but at the same time you feel even more distant and alone i almost started crying in front of a friend last night when i had this thought i was very sad and said as much but i didnt want to bring the mood down any further so i just sat there and felt worse for opening up even a little and moving further towards being a downer
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont really know im lazy and scared there genuinely are things in my life that bring me happiness but theyre slowly disappearing and are very few and far between suicide to me is the fall back plan its a comforting thought that i will always have that option im worthless im in pain i am a waste of space and i only bring down everyone around me if it doesnt get better soon i can just stop all my and their suffering now dying is scary but the thought of living the rest of my life like this is worse i guess i keep waiting for it to get better soon it hasnt though but im hopeful everyday i have a crippling panic attack about how shit everything is and it seems everyday i get news that something else has gone wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,i appreciate the work you do im glad you are such a caring and compassionate person but the hotline isnt perfect just like people arent perfect and there are still people who walk away feeling worse than before they called i dont think it hurts to encourage people to back off from relying on this hotline so much telling everyone to call will make it worse telling to call and then trying to help the other in person might lighten up the hotlines to be more compassionate and detailed yes i have been there my life sucked so bad that the person didnt know how to comfort me sometimes all we need to hear is that were not crazy were allowed to feel sad or mad it does suck and also that this too shall pass when the world seems to be out to get us the only hope you can give a suicidal person is that it may get better you lost your house well now you can start over in a new apartment etc there just always needs to be someone there to talk us down and say hey it wont always be like this and heres how
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is it with all these shitty suicide hotline experiences how are they allowed to be so shitty
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know i was only at the time he was older and a lot bigger than me i was hoping they could guide me to a safe house or something but instead he was like daww we all have fights i bet hell come home feeling awful with a big bunch of flowers nope quite the opposite
LifeProTips,not_removed,but the contrary might feel even more emotionless if they try to put it as some scripted shit nobody wants to hear a prerecorded voice tell them that they are important thats like an oxymoron
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah thats defo one thing they should fix unfortunate situation all around though
LifeProTips,not_removed,you and one other person jk it was me that upvoted you lol but seriously thanks for saying that it actually means a lot
LifeProTips,not_removed,do whatever you want to do have a list of stuff you might want to do and keep busy honestly although it seems like of people are going out tonight with friends to party i think there are a ton of us that are staying in either because they want to or have to i wish there was an easier way for people to meet unless your super outgoing and social or a people dont really give you time thats why you have to give yourself all the attentioncare you can
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have been doing it for two months now days a week and i hate it the only reason im even still going is because i tell myself nobody is going to want to be around me if i am a fat loser and that i cant handle failing another goal i have set for myself i dread waking up to excersise every morning and i always feel like shit after
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes i felt empty and dead inside no matter how much i exercised ive got a six pack now objectively look fantastic and should feel fantastic but i dont
LifeProTips,not_removed,selfimage could improve confidence bigger muscles would make a person healthier and hardier and tougher i for one think muscle exercise is often underestimated beneficially people are less likely to fuck with you when you arent seen as scrawny
LifeProTips,not_removed,i get it what seems a lack of genuineness can seem depressing and stupid but i dont doubt that op means it sure that love isnt on the same level of loving your family or friends or anything but love is a broad term and i think its fitting it just means that op does care about them heshe must care about love people in general especially those who need it and theres nothing wrong about that
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think if it helps someone feel even a little bit betterappreciatedloved at that particular difficult moment then i feel like it serves its purpose im not disagreeing with you but its important to note that the smallest things impact people in different ways
LifeProTips,not_removed,you know someone tried to say something nice to you and to connect and youre saying thats bullshit and pushing them away i dont know if thats the best attitude to have towards kindness
LifeProTips,not_removed,most of the time this is true and i would tell of people that there will be that silver lining at some pointto hang in there but sometimes there is that who cant undo the damage my wife and soulmate died in my arms at after losing a year battle with cancer that is a darkness i will carry on my back until the day i die or crumble under it thats just the way it is
LifeProTips,not_removed,we may not have free healthcare in the us but most us major cities have a designated free hospital that supports anyone without insurance and cant pay you will have to wait for hours though dallas has parkland hospital it is massive
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow do you remember the name of that epilepsy med yeah i know lots of things can interact with meds grapefruit juice even interacts with some for example but i was curious about what she said about the way she was taking them
LifeProTips,not_removed,daaamn thanks for sharing that is good information i know some doctors used fo prescribe pills that way and said you dont really need a period but honestly i think it is a reboot of your hormone levels among other things glad you figured it out and fixed your situation and thanks again for the info i know its a little personal but i appreciate it
LifeProTips,not_removed,its easy to get down when things dont work out for you and im not going to insist youre as easy to give up as me its one of my best skills but try not to let it get to you i got really really lucky with things straightening out for me to be in a good place now but i might not have had to be so lucky if i hadnt been so quick to give up and accept just being sad its good to hear youve been trying and i hope you keep at it good things are out there and its a lot less likely youll run in to them if youre down about not having found them yet you know i hope things start looking up
LifeProTips,not_removed,no not a selfish romantic love love for everything for the sun the moon for the oxygen you inhale for the people in your life for the things you do for yourself for the rain for the wind for the birds the bees for the universe in general warts and all that kind of love
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey bud this comment made me tear up a little thanks for the sage wisdom the helped a little it is good to feel emotions
LifeProTips,not_removed,if your thoughts arent who you are then who are you
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who suffers from depression i can affirm that this is very good advice more helpful than any medication is the ability to say to oneself these feelingsthese thoughts are being influenced by a chemical imbalance in my brain that will pass it helps to realize that it is an illness you can learn to cope with successfully as opposed to a state of being i say this is what im experiencing not this is who i am it wont take away the feeling but it lends a kind of peace that makes it easier to get through the day i also agree that diet and exercise aide mental health but a person who cannot bring themselves to get out of bed will not go for a nice heathful stroll
LifeProTips,not_removed,life isnt a movie life doesnt always get better or easier life often gets worse as you get older because you cant take your health for granted anymore and thats an additional complicationstressor lifestyle choices do matter on your outlook and daily meditation is so helpful but the environment can always get worse and you cannot always change that theres no guarantee whatsoever that ones life circumstances will get better the only thing we can affect is our own mind
LifeProTips,not_removed,you have to be the change you want no pill can help your hopelessness you have to work you have to try it isnt easy but you never give up unfortunately you have to try all ssris mood stabilizers etc trust me it sucks but the first step is healthy i cant diagnose because ive never met you but check out cbt change how you think
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres someone in my head but its not me so soothing
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was on mushrooms laying on the ground looking at the sky and a chicken pecked me in the eye
LifeProTips,not_removed,really love the album the only song i cant listen to without getting bad vibes is on the run the random steps in the background trip me out yo
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are loved
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha yea its pretty funny looking back on it but damn if i wasnt in a weird headspace then
LifeProTips,not_removed,never tried acid so i couldnt really relate here my trips have been mostly enjoyable so far so far
LifeProTips,not_removed,id definitely be one to disagree i think you havent really done your research friend
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey thatd be something id call if i needed it again
LifeProTips,not_removed,i imagine that although confidentiality is an issue these companies would keep records to somehow protect their asses if needs be evidence whether the judge allows it can then be requested via a warrantsubpoena or some grand jury request again im not a lawyer
LifeProTips,not_removed,its likely in uk law that they would look at to what extent a helpline takes on a duty of care in these circumstances and if they have undertaken a duty of care whether theyve acted negligently or recklessly
LifeProTips,not_removed,also studied law as far as i can remember the professional test for claims of a delictual nature would only extend to qualified professionals medical doctors offering medical advice engineers offering engineering advice etc afaik those call center staff may be trained in their respective fields but not deemed professionals im under the impression that the boni mores test for reasonableness would therefore be applied
LifeProTips,not_removed,i will second that exercise also seriously helped me but it takes a lot of willpower for me also
LifeProTips,not_removed,lots of people are saying go the gym in this thread i think you just need to exert energy find a hobby just do something get out of the house find new things push yourself pushing yourself seems to be the best thing i can think of
LifeProTips,not_removed,shes a character from the tv show walking dead one of the characters is suicidal and she pretty much says do it if you want to she didnt think the character would actually kill herself she doesnt but not after slashing her wrists and almost killing herself so basically its just letting the person do whatever and hoping that works out on its own basically what seems like the worst way to deal with suicidal tendencies
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not just him though maybe you should step back and take a realistic look at your profession are all doctors nurses etc bad absolutely not do a lot of them get busy and over worked and end up just going through the motions absolutely
LifeProTips,not_removed,way to just trivialize their problem very caring and understanding
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres not many people around to give them bad reviews
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres probably zero quality control
LifeProTips,not_removed,i havent looked into their training that they are supposed to have they are probably volunteers i do some volunteer work for domestic violence survivors i hope we always make a difference to them
LifeProTips,not_removed,after all it is just a dead end call center job that sucks the good out of people not sure if a suicide hotline is voluntary work
LifeProTips,not_removed,i volunteer on one we do our best were just people trying to do what we can in that moment some of us are more suited to your call than others some of us are more suited to any call than others training for us was class room sessions and hours of mentored call taking before you go solo i absolutely could have used more training but the main training happens on the calls when youre talking to someone thats reached out to you for support
LifeProTips,not_removed,some of them are underfunded nonprofits that rely on burnt out employees and volunteers with high turnover rates
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is absolutely enraging i hope youve long since gotten out and grown strong
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes there is it makes sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes it works on naive people only its hallmark card level empathy
LifeProTips,not_removed,well seeing all these idiots saying they love somebody theyve never spoken to in their entire lives just makes me hate everybody more and more
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont respond positively to fake kindness
LifeProTips,not_removed,you will have to wait for hours though lol who are you kidding its at least a hour wait at my er even with insurance the only way to get in quickly is probably with a bullet wound
LifeProTips,not_removed,then they just charge you later and ruin your credit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i believe its lamictalin some people it causes a terrible rash which in some people then causes skin bad peeling apparently
LifeProTips,not_removed,could be lamictil
LifeProTips,not_removed,im glad to share i was gonna do a big public psa on social media about it because i really just dont want anyone else to have to deal with this sort of thing but i know my family and friends probably dont want to hear about my mental and reproductive health im in total agreement now that sometimes your hormones need a reset i didnt notice a problem when i skipped a month as usual and the depression was definitely a cumulative thing that got worse and worse as time went on my doctors even told me a little break is good and i originally took them with the intention of taking one but a depressed brain is not a logical one
LifeProTips,not_removed,but that is the thing tho that is all i can do keep trying but for how long i have been going for years and it has only gotten worse if this is how im going to live my life id rather not live it at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,have you considered travelling for a change of scenery everytime i feel like everything is meaningless i think of the places i want to see so im working towards the goal of seeing beautiful places in the world alone if needed
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know this feeling ppl are telling you to fond the smal things that makes you happy but i cant think of anything that makes me happy everything is bland and the only thing that i think of when going to sleep is the thought of not having to wake upp the next day only to have the worst day of my life once again
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive been scrolling through this thread for a bit and i havent seen exercise mentioned at all so i thought id throw that out there i dont know what you do now or what youve tried but a consistent exercise routine can dramatically change your brain chemistry this is for a number of reasons the first being purely chemical but further the feeling of pride you get from forcing yourself into a routine and sticking to it is a big boost and then the feeling of moving around the world stronger and more nimble leads to selfconfidence and finally as shallow as it sounds looking better builds your sense of self as well all of that seems so amazing and unattainable when youre really deep in the muck but if you can get a foothold in something your body and mind will naturally begin to crave the rhythm of it ive been through the entire battery of professional mental health approaches and a solid unrelenting exercise routine is the only thing that has pushed me into longterm success the mental change comes gradually and over the course of years but its worth doing
LifeProTips,not_removed,damn sorry to hear youre going through all of that i genuinely hope things can improve for you and that you know someone cares not trying to give you a pity party etc just from one human to another internet hugs
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are asking if i appreciate life then no
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey thanks for the reply im so glad it helped a little just want you to know that its sincere ive been pretty low myself many times and my dogs help more than any therapy pills or workouts could you live for them they live for you you know its you they love not just some person who feeds them look at their faces when you walk through the door they wouldnt look at a stranger like that give your pups a hug when you need to feel something real in your heart not just pain or even worse nothing at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are the one who watches the thoughts but isnt defined by them
LifeProTips,not_removed,either nothingnobody or whatever you want to be depending on your semantic preference you should look into buddhist nirvana and meditation if youre interested edit or if you prefer the scientific route to a more philosophical one maybe research determinism and its relation to the self though the buddhist interpretation of these concepts will likely feel more positive to you the cold science has a tendency to bum out certain people
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have always had this question ever since i was a kid lets say a person gets hit in the head or a disease taking over that drastically changes said persons personality is it the same conciousness that used to expeirence hisher old self the same conciousness that experience the new one i think that theres a difference between your physical body your thoughts and the one who experience it all edit spelling
LifeProTips,not_removed,that album is the story of human existence from birth to eventual old age dementia then death such a classic all that you touch and all that you see is all your life will ever be
LifeProTips,not_removed,and everything under the sun is in tune but the sun is eclipsed by the moon there is no dark side of the moon really matter of fact its all dark great lyrics
LifeProTips,not_removed,you are loved
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you get a stye in the eye did you cry at least you didnt die you sound like a strong guy can you tie a pie sorry about the last one because im high bye
LifeProTips,not_removed,the beginning of time has made me shart a few times from unnecessary volume adjustments before i realized what was going on this is especially bad if you have it in a shuffled playlist
LifeProTips,not_removed,few years ago my mate gave me a few drops of strong acid i was a semi regular user and i watched the video of on the run fucks with your head like nothing else
LifeProTips,not_removed,by who
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i feel depressed the last fucking thing thats going to make me feel better is lame platitudes
LifeProTips,not_removed,community service isnt voluntary if its court ordered
LifeProTips,not_removed,they phrased it poorly but suicide hotlines are usually volunteer works often people who were or are suicidal themseles
LifeProTips,not_removed,you missed your chance at ianal
LifeProTips,not_removed,r v stone and dobinson for example often discussed in law classes using the example of someone drowning if you attempt to help them youre taking on a duty of care
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats true it normally goes something like this establish duty of care establish breach of duty of care establish causation and remoteness so basically everything i said would come after it had been established that there was a duty of care between the staff member and the person and that the staff member had breached it
LifeProTips,not_removed,those are pretty much my thoughts its very dismissive to tell someone to just go exercise plus as a teenage girl when anyone said exercise all i heard was youre fat id have a two hour sports practice every day then spend an hour killing myself at the gym barely ate but obviously just go to the gym was the solution to my depression i think its completely fine to share that exercise is something that helped you personally and i replied to the person i did because they shared it in a good nonpreachy way but its essential to recognize that its not the solution for everyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,depressed bodybuilder reporting in
LifeProTips,not_removed,didnt work for me ate right no processed carbs whole foods clean meat etc ran for at least miles per day looked great did it religiously for months still felt dead inside
LifeProTips,not_removed,go to the gym is what ever armchair therapist tells you to do but it dosent work
LifeProTips,not_removed,gotcha i knew basically what you were implying and yep horrible way to deal with it especially as a professional
LifeProTips,not_removed,being depressed doesnt give you the right to smear all medical professionals without getting called out for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,ya got me i laughed
LifeProTips,not_removed,admittedly i laughed
LifeProTips,not_removed,rjesuschristreddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,oshit
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh man lmao
LifeProTips,not_removed,they are
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have yes thank you im a lot older now and i dont take any shit however it has made it harder to admit when i need help and i tend to suck it up and move on than deal with it i know thats not necessarily healthy but i do ok its made me harder unfortunately but no man will ever violently hurt me again so theres that
LifeProTips,not_removed,if someone was standing off the edge of a bridge to jump i would stop them because i care about humans and i feel that humanity as a whole is good and will accomplish great things in millennia to come you could say i love humanity and this can translate to me caring enough about one person to go out of my way to save them love has a lot to do with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree its a nice sentiment but ultimately does not help the person who feels like shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,what makes you say its fake
LifeProTips,not_removed,there has been changes to the credit that medical bankruptcy or medical debt is not actually included in your credit score
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a bipolar person lamictal saved my fucking sanity im so much more productive and i dont panic over getting in the car anymore i love that drug i was so mentally fucked up and that plus therapy made me so much better
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had cptsd for years now once upon a time i was also ready to just accept my fate if you think years is long try try try years the time it takes to find your own happiness in your own ways can be so varying you think you may never find anything worth living for but of course if you quit now youll never know youll never know if next year is the one where you finally start achieving the things youve been searching so long for this is coming from someone who struggles with ptsd depression and anxiety daily hell even hourly there are days my brain defaults to suicidal ideation its tough to fight but even i know i have to fight it even if i dont really know why in the moment i try to always find things that i love about life the small things especially wind in my hair or the trees a beautiful sunrise a nice invigorating hike my cats loving me a happy dog on the street gorgeous scenery like forests or the beach or a clearing a great song things like that
LifeProTips,not_removed,im guessing you have been to quite a few doctorspsychiatriststherapists after years doctors can check that your liver kidneys and thyroid are fine they can also check your vitamin and vitamin b levels if you ask nicely you can have an mri to check for lesionstumor psychiatrists will prescribe every flavor of anti depressant under the sun all seem to be ssris but testing how effective each of these are takes to weeks before you deem the experiment a success or failure of patients respond to first antidepressant prescribed this number rises to percent by second antidepressant prescribed this leaves a chunk of the population that does not respond to traditional antidepressants at that point you may need to start considering that you have treatment resistant depression therapistspsychologists can be frustrating first few sessions feel like writing checks just to say hi and introducing yourself despite feeling silly to me evidence seems to show that cognitive behavioral therapy is effective if you have exhausted this first line of defense and you did it with enough discipline to fully evaluate its effectiveness then you can consider options my doctors never talked to me about electro convulsive therapy ect or ketamine infusions ketamine is the hottest new depression research my google results return it is on fast track for approval but is not fda approved yet so insurance will not help you pay for it since it requires several treatments this is likely a to experiment your city likely has one or two clinics nearby or you may have to drive to a neighboring town ect sounds scary as hell and the stigma of it whew but i heard recently that carrie fisher found immense relief from it when ketamine didnt help my mom said she read that take it with a grain of salt and that you are asleep when they do it insurance will likely make this a cheap experiment i am not a doctor this is my own narrow viewpoint of the process as a depressed man with doctors visits and access to google still i hope it at least shows that there are things to try and that you cant give up until you try them all while you have another thing to try then you have to keep going sending you love stranger you are not alone
LifeProTips,not_removed,what have you tried
LifeProTips,not_removed,well thats your choice of course but i think youre missing out what kind of life could you appreciate
LifeProTips,not_removed,that doesnt make any sense to me literally the only two things that make a person are their physical body and the thoughts within it and id say the thoughts are the much more important bit
LifeProTips,not_removed,that last line is so powerfully true and scary
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks im sure some one loves you too
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always wonder how someone who said the above can answer your question we all know damn well that they dont as much as someone might deny
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know that acronym but chose not to use it for very obvious reasons
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is not entirely true sport or sport therapy can be very effective you are being active doing something healthy learning more about yourself learning that you are able to do stuff you achieve things and may get social contacts sport helps a lot of mentally ill people not everyone maybe working with clay helps you more or painting etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,it isnt just him behavioral hospitals are absolute hell no one has any common sense including the professionals its like they do everything in their power to make things worse for the patients
LifeProTips,not_removed,while i tend to agree with that i feel its worth considering the context of the person commenting and the overall purpose of the medical field obviously people in a depressed state of mind arent always rational or even cogniscent of what their actions might look like from the outside its up to medical professionals to know that understand that any critism they get might be stemming from a person not in a healthy state of mind and fulfill their responsibility to treat patients and keep their well being above everything else being depressed doesnt give you a right to be an unwarranted dick to people but it does give you a right to be treated with compassion and understanding besides medical professionals are not above criticism and a lot of these anecdotal experiences and sentiments are indications of real and unaddressed problems in medicine especially with regards to mental health
LifeProTips,not_removed,everybody is very loving in their made up scenarios they use to stroke their ego
LifeProTips,not_removed,not knowing is the thing tho if i got told that in years you will be fine i would have no problem living that time in missery but the thought of this beeing my life just makes me not want to live
LifeProTips,not_removed,natures solace is there for us all if we can access it through pets or nature walks city folks could volunteer at an animal shelter some could go to soup kitchens but watch you dont get dragged down further by your choice a no kill pet shelter would be safest
LifeProTips,not_removed,to your last point carrie fisher was indeed a strong proponent of ect honestly until reading her interviews i didnt even realize it was a legitimate form of therapy today for example its considered one of the safest forms of treatment for severely depressed pregnant women id always stigmatized it with the movies representation of treatments but its come a long way
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive seen patients treated with ect and its seems to have varying levels of successbut none of the scary side effects that people always assume it will have though the people ive seen treated with it have had some sort of psychosis that was not responding to other treatments and not depression
LifeProTips,not_removed,look up joe dispenza breaking the habit of being yourself it will help you understand whats going on at a neurological level and may give you a new sense of possibility its not impossible to change your situation it just takes thinking thats way outside the norm it can also however be much less difficult than you think wish you well
LifeProTips,not_removed,it would be good to find somebody anybody just a couple friends is all i really have you need to make an effort to click with people especially if you havent been doing it for a long time as said have you considered volunteering you can meet very nice people there do you have hobbies or things you like to do sports and playing music are huge ones for self esteem any other kind of hobbie is good especially if you are making something or honing a skill making yourself happy with only yourself is the best thing to do first if you dont feel your attractive change the things you dislike most hit the gym all those stupid tips people have add up to be honest what helped me most is the hobbiesskills thing i do a lot of shop work and whenever i create or fix something i get so satisfied knowing im getting better and more capable i still really want to learn an instrument but havent been able to push for that yet my cousin said something to me over christmas tomorrow is never easier its the same bullshit everyday but tomorrow i will be stronger and smarter tomorrow is easier because of yesterday life doesnt get easier you just get better at it it really stuck with me and can be applied so broadly none of that fake friend crap but hit me up in a pm if you ever want to just talk and shoot the shit doesnt matter when ill get back to you i really hope you find happiness somewhere in your life by your self and with others theres a lot of beauty out there you just need to find what it is in your eye
LifeProTips,not_removed,one where i could talk to people without having a panic attack one where i dont have to lie to people and say that im ok one where my family arent pestering me about why im still singel one where i dont think the most worthless waste of space failure in the world is me
LifeProTips,not_removed,httptinybuddhacombloglivingrightnowyouarenotyourthoughtsandfeelings your thoughts can change they eb and flow your beliefs change through your life and are fluid as your thoughts therefore you are not defined by your thoughts as that can change mostly its your perspective and the little judge inside is a reflection of our fears wishes desires routine monologue and surface level attempt to control consciousness look into dbt act and or emdr for treatment options if it seems like your thoughts are controlling you
LifeProTips,not_removed,when one has no thoughts in particular on their mind they are still themselves
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres a third feature commonly called the soul or in a less twee sense the observer if you meditate a lot eventually you start to abstract the observer inside you from your own thoughts in meditation you learn to witness sensations thoughts emotions and feelings come and go within you ive gotten the sense that i am not my thoughts that i am the water and my thoughts are waves theyre the energy within me taking form they come and go as circumstance requires but i dont have much to do with them a lot of the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,he said it so he can pat himself on the back and feel smug about what a great compassionate person he is
LifeProTips,not_removed,not everyone is loved thats bullshit unfortunately regardless of what people want to think about the human condition
LifeProTips,not_removed,you very obviously should have used it not everyone is as loose and free with their anallingo as you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i totally get this it seems never ending and realistically there is no guarantee it will end i dont know how much longer i can live like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you believe that life is not worth living you need to seek help redditors cant help you and they cant make you see the little happiness in every day life happy isnt just something that you get to one day you have to work for it you have to see the little things every day and be happy in the moment you arent going to wake up in a year and have everything figured out and perfect just rolling along like in the movies some days are bad and some days will be good but you have to try please for yourself and the people in your life seek help
LifeProTips,not_removed,things he described make it worth it for me if i could watch the sun come up every morning that would be enough for me getting out always helps me not like to see people or to do anything just to be outside and be a part of the world is amazing it makes the grind bearable find a few beautiful things for yourself and use them as your discipline to get through the day when motivation escapes you
LifeProTips,not_removed,trust me you are not the most failed at life other people take that mantle i am sure maybe their is a record book of failures that keeps track of them to degrees it is just not where we would want it to be at this age and it does not sit right with us and again that saying goes it is not really failure if you learned something from it so then we learned that we are worthless wastes of space okay great well now that means we just have to create worth and take up less space i am not sure i think downsizing and getting rid of clutter helps sometimes
LifeProTips,not_removed,memories are thoughts emotions are thoughts id say if somebody has no thoughts then they are either a corpse or in a dreamless sleep
LifeProTips,not_removed,seems like anyone who believes all life has value and purpose can love anyone else
LifeProTips,not_removed,help costs money if you dont have it no one cares about you people always say you are loved people care about you and please get help without thinking about what that entails there is nothing more crushing than taking that advice and holding on to that last little bit of hope and then seeing it snuffed out before you when you try to get help and no one seems to give a shit because youre broke sometimes you have a shitty family and sometimes your friends abandon or ignore you and sometimes your significant others will just use you and for some people all of these things are true im not trying to be an asshole honestly im not but sometimes life beats people so far into the ground that theres just no clawing out the earth is too soft and you just keep falling back into the hole and one day you look up into the sky from the bottom of that hole and realize that nobodys coming to the edge to throw a rope down what do you do then what do you do when youre out of strength and that hole is now a grave
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres a school of therapy called cbt cognitive behavioural therapy your thoughts your mood your behaviour and your body are all linked the biggest thing here is that you have the option to look at a thought and choose whether or not to believe it some thoughts you may have are not true and others need to be changed because theyre damaging you have the ability to objectively decide how you feel on each thought you have does that not resemble some sort of decision maker over your thoughts
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think the advice was concerning memories just certain lines of thought perhaps concerning memories but not the memories themselves there is nothing inherently sad about memories only thinking about them in certain ways makes us sad and i believe the advice was to recognise when these harmful thoughts are starting and learning to just let them pass and not get emotionally involved in them
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is the kind of love you have for a comfy pair of pants not the kind of love we are talking about
LifeProTips,not_removed,and add to your blind spot
LifeProTips,not_removed,rshittylifeprotips
LifeProTips,not_removed,take one extra bag from the store thread it through the handles of all your bags and tie a knot in it now you can easily pick up all the bags at once
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt get convex mirrors and add them to your side view mirrors to decrease your blind spot in addition get a wide convex rear view mirror
LifeProTips,not_removed,or adjust settings to add or minutes either way
LifeProTips,not_removed,also great tip for recording shows that are on after always record them for longer in case the game runs late
LifeProTips,not_removed,my tivo box tells me if it is a live event and to add time on afterwards i also leave it on that channel in case it overruns that as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt for old people who still have a dvr
LifeProTips,not_removed,call me dumb but whats more advanced than a dvr
LifeProTips,not_removed,lmao
LifeProTips,not_removed,the internet
LifeProTips,not_removed,whilst some shows may only be available on digital tv almost all channels in australia at least have a website which allows you to stream or even download episodes theres also sites like netflix that may have your show otherwise you can get a tv tuner card for your computer and record your show straight to your hard drive same as a dvr
LifeProTips,not_removed,whilst some shows may only be available on digital tv almost all channels in australia at least have a website which allows you to stream or even download episodes theres also sites like netflix that may have your show op is talking about live sporting events not shows generally netflix isnt going to be streaming the latest match
LifeProTips,not_removed,no idea how underdeveloped you countries tv people are but here in germany every major tv channel has a website with everything archived
LifeProTips,not_removed,im aware op is talking about live shows and my point is the same i dont actually have digital tv at home due to antenna problems but i still watch live sport events via streaming like state of origin same goes for cricket and afl there are even mobile phone apps to watch but they require a subscription no idea why someone downvoted me they clearly dont understand how internet works
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you sometimes i regret posting info like this because people who dont know anything just assume im an idiot and providing false info instead of researching into it further
LifeProTips,not_removed,is it tourettes or just this one thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre ok with it why do you need to stop it i have tourettes and being ok with it wasis the hardest part but here are some things ive found useful my neurologist told me a lot of people have tics in some way he went to his sons play and told me he noticed several children with tics knowing this helped to normalise it for me and i try to pick up on other peoples tics too now quite often people are unaware of their own or others tics and it helped me to put it in to perspective and remember that its all just a sliding scale of oddities have you tried transferring itmasking it to something else over years ive trained myself to release my tics as coughsthroat clearingshudders etc much more preferable to loud screeching and head jerking find an action that is similar enough to your tic but more acceptable can you hold your hand up and pretend youre about to sneeze or give yourself a good scratch on the temples or something i found knowing i could cover up my tics made me less nervous about them and less nervous less stressed fewer tics also theres a good chance you will still grow out of them ive been ticcing since age probably reached a peak and its been declining ever since now granted my tourettes is fairly mild but its still tourettes i am a teacher and so always around people yet i dont think any students or colleagues have ever noticed my tics most ticstourettes do get milder with age
LifeProTips,not_removed,its just the one thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,im only bothered by it because of the lines and wrinkles its making on my face at an early age i worry what ill look like when im in my plus all the rubbing makes my eyes look tired and bruised and i want to get lasik but how will i handle the recovery time let alone the procedure if i cant stop running my eyes
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe ask rskincareaddiction for a good eye cream then
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont ask any questions just listen to the gossip and dont say anything
LifeProTips,not_removed,try to make friends vertically and horizontally hear what people have to say listen to how they say it by horizontal i mean get the perspectives and experiences of the sales guys the marketing guys the engineers etc by vertically i mean get to know your juniors and seniors and understand what their experience at the company has been i find it best to be focused on acting or ideally genuinely being interested in individuals in different sections of the company then you start to piece together what motivates who who influences who whos reacting to who and so on dont initially try to run against company culture but do come across as interested helpful and eager to connect with people its as stephen covey said seek first to understand then to be understood dont worry about jamming everyone full of facts about you and your rockstar status at your old company your hobbies your gpa your alma mater etc no one gives a fuck yet after you know a lot of people and you have influence and reputation through building your network within the company and doing good reliable work then people will start to care about you and want to know more about you thats when you start to reveal more and talk more about yourself after people have a reason to be curious about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,research the company whos the big dog what do they do for business who are they involved with reputation reviews how does one move up in the company and how readily available are those opportunities or is it a deadend position are there team projects and ask what the position being inquired about does and what are the responsibilities tie the question in with how it would work in regards to the company thats just a small list
LifeProTips,not_removed,most of that stuff you cant anticipate beforehand you have to feel it out and listen to the co workers its best not to have an opinion about anyone for a while as you collect information while you adjust to work
LifeProTips,not_removed,which guy here is most likely to dress in camo and grap an ar to cleanout the rats nest
LifeProTips,not_removed,the first person to try to befriend you is not necessarily the person to trust generally they have no friends or are toxic and see you as fresh meat be aware that if often takes up to months to be trusted and get the real dirt on many issues be nice to the support staff they often will cover your ass if there is even something like a document you need scanned in the office when you are in the field dont be so nice its sickening but say good morning ask about their kids etc be careful in making any broad comments like yeah masons i always thought that was a weird organisation sometimes it is helpful to keep notes if you are in an environment with a lot of employees so you remember conversations so when everyone comes back from vacation you remember who has in barbados and who was in the bahamas also you can add items in your calendar to remind yourself to ask people about things like someone mentions they are buying a new house one month later you can ask them how they are enjoying their new neighbourhood this works for me because i work with about people and i see them off and on over a year if she comes up with good ideas and is willing to share the praise or not cut teammates down when she has opportunity people will come forward to partner with her i also give people in other departments a lot of free ideas they get the credit for them i am seen as a team player and as a result i have had a lot of opportunity for growth
LifeProTips,not_removed,flying cars for real this time
LifeProTips,not_removed,assuming our technology will be relevant or used at all in their time
LifeProTips,not_removed,our generation is the first fully integrated generation that allows for this type of link to the future cameras have been around for a few generations now
LifeProTips,not_removed,well i assume that since hillary clinton was elected last week the world must be a hellish apoctolyptic nightmare by now
LifeProTips,not_removed,is not the time for this
LifeProTips,not_removed,geez grandpa why are you so grumpy in this video ok now seriously do we have fucking flying cars stop the bullshit
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres an episode of cowboy bebop that addresses this where one of the characters finds a video of herself as a teenager on betamax it would be wise to assume something similar will happen to our current technologiesvideo codecs
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes but smartphones with cameras have only existed for about years and our storage photo quality and batteries are much better this allows the mainstream as smartphones are highly commonplace to record their experiences in a way thats unlike any other generation before us
LifeProTips,not_removed,but today literally everyone have one little camera in their pocket
LifeProTips,not_removed,lmao this gets me in a fallout mood i dont want to set the world on fire i just want to start a flame in your heart in my heart i have but one desire and that one is you no other will do
LifeProTips,not_removed,but talk about the world today what you predict of the future your best memories and anything else worthwhile you can think of could be done and has been done extensively in the past years you really dont need a smartphone to do what this thread tells you to do example so the our generation is the first fully integrated generation that allows for this type of link to the future line really doesnt apply
LifeProTips,not_removed,years ago of the families had a videocamera
LifeProTips,not_removed,great video but as for my comment what i meant to say is different than what the op said i never tried to argue that our generation is the first to record the experiences of the common man my argument centered around the idea that the smartphone age allows practically anyone to do this on the same level as the year old in the video they dont need to go out and buy a tool specifically for this they just need to pull out a tool they commonly carry around and start recording
LifeProTips,not_removed,my past experience with people who are always worried about me cheating on them is that they ended up cheating on me so my advice if youre in a situation where your partner is constantly suspicious of you or even accusing you of cheating break things off because its not worth the drama and they might be projecting on you anyway as they are the ones cheating
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you constantly worry about it you dont trust them and if you dont trust them end it a relationship without trust is like a boat without sails itll get you nowhere
LifeProTips,not_removed,definitely a selfesteem problem i would change this lpt to dont start a relationship if youre not happy yourself it will save you time nerves and money
LifeProTips,not_removed,every person in the relationship can choose to leave at anytime be grateful for what you have and indulge in that if you are spending all of your time being suspect of your other half you are wasting your time and in all probability driving them away by being so suspicious
LifeProTips,not_removed,worrying makes you look like a bitch which makes them cheat its a self proving prophecy
LifeProTips,not_removed,instead of worrying whether your partner is cheating or not spend the time instead and reflect on yourself and what caused it to a point where you no longer trust your partner people dont just go out and have an affair if they are content and love you there is always a reason are you being the best boyfriendgirlfriend you can be whatever it is identify it act on it and make a change
LifeProTips,not_removed,wtf seriously very clingy needy post sounds like someone needs a shot of self esteem
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep had this happen to me got accused twice of looking at singles websites when she didnt even see what was on my screen after the second time i demanded she explain why she kept accusing me of this she said she had her high school boyfriend cheat on her and got somebody pregnant behind her back this was years before we even met so it had zero to do with me wtf in the end she ended up breaking up with me and moving in immediately with another guy
LifeProTips,not_removed,you plagiarized that didnt you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i mean cruise ships dont have sails
LifeProTips,not_removed,well said
LifeProTips,not_removed,i own two boats and neither of them have sails they both get me where i need to go
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats fine im just saying my experience has been when i was being accused of cheating i found out shortly later that they were the ones cheating on me maybe they felt it was justified because they were sure i was the one cheating or maybe it was their lack of trust or insecurity that led them to go ahead and cheat on me for my part back when i actually did date i just never cared enough to be suspect if they wanted the cheat fine ill just move on and delete your contact infoblock your callstexts i dont have time or patience for that sort of behavior
LifeProTips,not_removed,boat
LifeProTips,not_removed,everyone knows cruise ships are just floating cities
LifeProTips,not_removed,be courteous to your coworkers make eye contact say hello ask them how they are smile employees who have been around a while will wonder why you ignore them if you dont do these things it is especially important to do this early on to make an impression on your jobs community

LifeProTips,not_removed,i rented a car that had a ding in the windshield got it noted on the rental form probably save me inspection is more important than pictures when you rent but you want pictures when you drop it off get something currently dated in a couple of the pictures like the gas receipt you got when you topped it off before bringing it back i like to take a picture of the odometer reading with the gas receipt with their parking lot showing through the windshield
LifeProTips,not_removed,paint the car white
LifeProTips,not_removed,leave the car parked in a tree or a building shadow leave the windows a bit open before you get in the car open the doors and let the cool air flow
LifeProTips,not_removed,get one of those reflective screens that go on the inside of your windshield
LifeProTips,not_removed,something like this

LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck off sasquatch i bought it for and in great condition besides ac
LifeProTips,not_removed,how does one find your nearest war veteran do i just put an ad on craigslist
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did this by accident but it turned me on to the idea that you can find stories in places you least expect turns out my nearest war veteran owns the quickie mart down the street and served in the chinese special forces while we didnt have dinner with him every time i go into the store with my daughter he talks to us about things he learned hes given us selfdefense demonstrations personal advice and has told us stories about all sorts of crazy stuff ironically my favorite story of his took place in the us where he thwarted armed with guns robbers with a set of nunchucks he managed to subdue them until the police got there also he was at the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,only kind of story youll get from a veteran is how many times he masturbated before going to accidentally kill some civilians only interesting war stories come from war movies
LifeProTips,not_removed,simple go to the nearest old homearmed with a pistol of course fire off a few shots in the air then pick whoever goes into a ptsdlike trauma and exchange contact information and where to meetup for tea
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres a few living under a bridge near my hotel
LifeProTips,not_removed,but you need to exchange this info in morse code or else he is a fake
LifeProTips,not_removed,this doesnt work
LifeProTips,not_removed,yea same thing happened with my mom she lost her oldest brother and replayed the only voicemail that she had of him for a while glad you brought this up
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you teach new stuff to older generation insist they do that task repeatedly else they tend to forget the steps
LifeProTips,not_removed,i didnt know how to do this and my old iphone broke shortly after my dad died always wished i had thought of it sooner so i could keep all the vms he left me
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is something i regret not doing i think i have a recording of my grandma somewhere but god knows where she passed away on the of december at our home id love to have some permanent piece of memory and i got that a deck of cards a key to her cabinet handkerchiefs gave them to me the day before she died and odds and ends

LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont hate a lot of it but parts of it i do a lot of the internal stuff is good i like directx and task manager improvements and so on its the spying and metro interface and attempting to integrate everything with online stuff that annoys me
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have used every release since dos a fair number of people always scream bloody murder but every release is a step forward even when it feels painful complaining about a new release is futile unless you expect to die soon
LifeProTips,not_removed,go to the apple store and buy a macbook i know youve been hating on them all these years but you really will love it
LifeProTips,not_removed,it caused my printer and gopros to stop working i downgraded back to windows and everything works again
LifeProTips,not_removed,takes about a half hour to disable all the hidden mandatory surveillance programs and then youre good to go
LifeProTips,not_removed,i do
LifeProTips,not_removed,i could build a pc twice as good for the same cost
LifeProTips,not_removed,ew gross apple is the worst
LifeProTips,not_removed,no
LifeProTips,not_removed,well i think thats more of a problem with the companies not releasing software patchesdrivers etc than im not a microsoft fanboy by any means but i think we should hold the companies accountable for releasing current upgrades to their hardware
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you look for new drivers
LifeProTips,not_removed,half hour you could uncheck the settings while installing it took about seconds
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats actually incorrect im not an apple fanboy but really the apple tax for mbps is only about markup just remember to compare all the features
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey i get hes forcing his opinion onto you but do you have to do it also
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree i was unable to get window drivers for my printer to work and the gopro drivers didnt exist for windows either way i was unaware i could revert back to windows until i read it while trying to find solutions for the gopro issue
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep they didnt work
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres a few hidden and nefarious operations going on that youre not supposed to know about or disable a builtin keylogger for one that sends information to microsoft and is capable of reading every keystroke you make it has to be disabled through dos dos should instead be command prompt as it was pointed out to me that they are not the same

LifeProTips,not_removed,which printer
LifeProTips,not_removed,hp they have a driver for windows but while trying to install it it would always fail the main reason i reverted is because windows failed to recognize anything plugged into the usb ports
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you decide to try again and i hope you do cause its an amazing os uninstall the original printer driver first before installing the win driver

LifeProTips,not_removed,hi we are selling stuff you no them why not you shut the door
LifeProTips,not_removed,distract the big one with a rabbit
LifeProTips,not_removed,had this happen at a house we rented there were out of residents there when a good looking tall and charismatic blonde dude gave us some shady bullshit about being from a security company he had a fake business card with a blue shield and everything but really insisted on coming inside to give us a free assessment about crucial breakin points for burglars ie the perfect sting for this fucking prick first and foremost call out behind you like you had just heard your roomate or wife call out respond overly loud and interrupt their spiel with no honey just salesmen keep the boys in the room if youre actually smarta survivalist talk this plan out in code w your roomieso so they know to call the cops immediatelyor get roomates tho glad you had a dog secondly ask for proof of employment the good ones keep a single fake business card and ask for it back when you ask if you can keep it like this fucking asshat did but just assure them that youre calling their employer close the door on them lock it third call the police your landlord ours specifically asked is it some blue eyed blonde haired guy above good looking yeah call the cops this creep has been in my neighborhood for years picking off houses stall him he knew exactly what was up when he saw my roomate on the phone and we opened the door again but honestly you need to learn to parent which means keeping a poker face for immense assumed lying they just claimed that your neighbor bought some mags you ask really who was it the fake name johnsons next door can i see their purchase order the key point in all of this is that you owe a stranger at your door absofuckinglutely nothing close and lock the door the second you get a bad feeling in your gut and call out loudly honey call the police describe the visitors abrasively and loud if theyre actual salesmen yeah slimy but they have credentials they literally have nothing to worry about if thats the case theres a huge difference between rude and stupid edit i really must harp on my final point especially because burglars and scam artists are some of the smartest quickest thinking scumbags in the world you must know that they scour message boardsfeeds like this for their pregame strategy more importantly op might be trying to vet a sting right now by posting this i dont take issue if its on a reddit board its likelier that more good hearted people who genuinely want a lpt about the subject will use this info for good but again i must insist trust your gut instinct if someone makes you feel unsafe on the fucking doorstep youd be insane to trust them to stand there another minute and get a peek inside imagine if you were in your car if someone refuses to leavewalk away from your car door after knocking on the window drive away protect yourself call someone shout out to ugarycarroll for reminding me this is a very smart thing for parents to do as well my single father had to have others pick us up from school or other functions from time to time so he made sure that only we all knew dad bro and i a codeword to ask of someone we didnt immediately recognize and named us and our dad out loud thanks for another tip especially for womensmaller targets if youre ever walking in a densely populated area or the shady part of town carry your keys individually between your fingers like wolverine spikes twys example of women getting raped in industrial areas around corners reminded me of the time my stepmom recounted living in venice beach in the her dad gave her this tip and unfortunately one night some goon lunged out of an alley grabbing her by the hair and pulling her into darkness she swung blindly she said the only thing she remembers from that night was his screaming as she ran to safety and pulled chunks of skin from her keys two years plus ive been hoping for gold thanks kind stranger and reddit today feels like a lot of good getting a lot of comments on the key trick saying it can cause a broken hand first and foremost ill take a broken hand over a broken anus hymen any day secondly this trick was taught to my stepmother who did not have a car if youre walking to and home from work smaller keys stay hidden and creep out between the knuckles and unless you have a car key on ring it is very difficult to get the sharpestlongest one ready lastly you arent looking to shank a bitch but get away as quickly as possible if someone grabs you from behind swing around aim for the face and neck and continue to spin out and away from your attacker and run making a cock back motion and driving downward will be easier to block for your attacker and if a solid jab goes deep enough theres still the time it takes to pull it out which gives your attacker time to react and you with the decision of whether to leave your keys ive never had this personally happen to me and i hope no one has to use it but this is info coming from my stepmom so its likely outdated but still applies to poorcollege students rather than not having a plan
LifeProTips,not_removed,set little traps all over the place using your toys household supplies paint buckets etc and hope your family gets back to chicago by christmas morning
LifeProTips,not_removed,you should legally tell him to get the fuck out of your property gran torino style
LifeProTips,not_removed,hi cop here call us thats a pretty common way of casing a residence i would say sure let me go get my wallet then go in and close the door behind me quietly lock the door and call then then dont go back outside till we arrive try to keep an eye on them from up stairs through the shades without moving the shades so they dont know youre watching watch their direction of travel if they leave a clothing description and vehicle description preferably with license plate number
LifeProTips,not_removed,one aspect to the ops question is being ignored its a much more tense standoff at the moment he is questioning what could i do to feel safe get him off my doorstep one guy is in his face not feet away and one guy is feet away with ops dog closeby kind of held hostage if op were to take one more step toward his dog to bring it in the house he would be provoking the standoff in the eyes of the enemy in that moment you have no gun you could turn your back to them leave your dog out there as you walk in to your house where the two guys might rush the door nasty situation when you start feeling that paranoid sense of impending trouble
LifeProTips,not_removed,call let them see you call the police they dont want to deal with the police they will leave
LifeProTips,not_removed,i read the title as you trying to remove a stranger from your family will and i was scratching my head the whole time through the story dumbfounded where it would lead my first thought was they conned your grandmother into signing something shady
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am in ontario canada in a big city but on a quiet cul de sac i get some pushy salespeople but generally play with them most are flat out liars and thieves for the most part trying to sell you shit you dont need for a higher than normal price ill ask a lot of questions then pick apart their product if i am in a rush or not in the mood i just tell them to fuck off and leave no gun no threats on one occasion the guy was creepy and i had to go pick up the kids somewhere so i took my cell phone and snapped a few picks of him i told him there had been break ins in the neighbourhood and he looked suspicious he should probably leave he did
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can call the police
LifeProTips,not_removed,legally you can get a bigger dog id suggest a boerboel look it up i delivered pizzas to a house a while back and there is kids in the driveway probably like years old and a giant boerboel no parents to be seen i parked on the street and got out of my car the boerboel stood up i walked towards the end of the driveway the boerboel walked in between me and the kids and just looked at me like the fuck u want i just stood there and was like ummm can one of you go get your parents they were too young to understand that their dog could kill me
LifeProTips,not_removed,tell them to leave knocking on someones front door isnt trespassing assuming they didnt scale a fence to get to that door if they dont leave shut and lock the door then call the police if they force their way in kill them if you kill them dont answer any questions from the police until youve spoken with an attorney
LifeProTips,not_removed,he is within his rights to speak with you and is not trespassing until he is given a lawful order to leave the premises further refusal to leave is criminal trespass as i understand it without any specific order against it nor specific permissions a visitor can come up and knock on your front door and visit your porch unless youve got no trespassing signs he cannot jump a fence of course unless its the meter reader but once ordered to leave the premises this implied visiting permission is revoked and is legally obligated to leave immediately with no further discussion unless a meter reader or cop or whatever he cannot stay on your porch thats trespassing he would have to retreat to a public sidewalk at best dont play their game theyre just seeing how long they can play with you you can actually stop it at any time leave my property now why what else you gonna spend it on not going to discuss anything leave the property now never come back why you gotta be so bye close the door honestly the cops want to be called on these people they do they do for the most part a cop on patrol drives around all day and barely sees shit and a stolen bike call or brokeninto car has almost zero chance of any sort of justice in the end bad stuff actively going on with someone to stop is like gold these people are intimidating residents now and very likely casing the neighborhood to rob later it is not impossible theyre looking for someone to rob or rape right now if the opportunity arises if you call right away tell them which way theyre headed cops have like an chance of confronting them pretty likely theyll have outstanding warrants at least with the cops coming down on them and having taken their id down its a bad idea to come by later and burglarize the neighborhood they cant readily move on to another neighborhood in the same town either theyre already on file for suspicions and to get stopped again is increasingly risky
LifeProTips,not_removed,this thread is the stupidest fucking thing ive ever read shit i need another drink leave the doorstep close and lock the doors call the police wait next time dont partake in such interactions if walking away doesnt work well for you have you considered absurd but vaguely believable lies sorry man i need it for all my treatments is vague and fairly sympathyinducing and a good conversationender if you can pull off righteous indignation a recent death in the family can have the same effect or you could really turn up the social awkwardness and start spilling all kinds of saucy stories to them until they left on their own look i get that they seemed shitty and all that and i love gun talks and self defense as much as the next guy but how do i get out of this awkward social situation has so many better answers
LifeProTips,not_removed,one was taller chubby and a lot bigger than me with a quieter kinder disposition the other was shorter with minging grimy stained teeth and did almost all of the talking did this actually happen or are you describing the plot to home alone
LifeProTips,not_removed,im going to close the door now if youre still standing here in hours im coming out with my gun hell eventually get tired and leave conceding the victory to you
LifeProTips,not_removed,you say fuck off or ill get my neighbours magazine call the distributor and the cops and your little sojourn to ireland will be cancelled get the fuck off my property you greasy fuck although here in australia this is more of a greeting
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you live in the states see if your state has a httpsenmwikipediaorgwikicastledoctrine basically it states that you have the right to feel safe in your home usually extends to the entire property and grants you to use up to deadly force if reasonable to protect yourself from a threat i would start off by telling your magazine salesmen they need to leave the property if they fail to comply im calling the police becaus they are now trespassing if they approach me in a threatening manner theyre getting a gun drawn on them dont draw a gun on someone unless you are ready to shoot them some people will call your bluff walk up and take that gun right from your hands know the laws where you live regarding use of deadly force
LifeProTips,not_removed,lots of great lpts for this sort of situation in the film home alone
LifeProTips,not_removed,how did it end up op you dropped off at the climax of the story
LifeProTips,not_removed,lots of gun related responses please dont just draw a gun on someone if you feel unsafe a sword sends a much stronger message
LifeProTips,not_removed,i live in texas so everyone can probably expect my answer so ill just go ahead and leave
LifeProTips,not_removed,i keep bear spray by the door
LifeProTips,not_removed,close the door and lock it
LifeProTips,not_removed,god i need to get off reddit i thought this was a metaphorical question about scotland and the brexit
LifeProTips,not_removed,pull down your pants and start pissing on the ground around them to establish that its your property youve gotta take your pants off all the way though
LifeProTips,not_removed,walk into your house and close the door on them
LifeProTips,not_removed,ask them if theyve heard the good news then go on to ramble about a specific religion for a few minutes can be any of your choosing theyll leave because theyll think youre crazier than them and frankly thats a good thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,they told me they wanted to sell magazines so they could go to ireland thats when you say actually i have some magazines for you then you pull out your ak thats the american way to do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,dial and stay inside oo but no for real dial call the police and lock your door
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends on your state calling the police is not always your best bet in some cities police can take minutes to arrive however pulling out a gun should be a last resort as a gun owner i hope to never have to kill someone but i will if its to prevent me or anyone else from getting hurt or worse i would rather be judged by than be carried by
LifeProTips,not_removed,im guessing they left since this happened a few years ago so whatever you did worked do that
LifeProTips,not_removed,what state were you in if texas you could have brandished your you had in your long coat the whole time and told them to leave or die if nys you could have invited them for tea let them fuck your wife and still get sued because they got a tummy ache source lawyer certified in sarcasm in all seriousness what you can do depends entirely on the state
LifeProTips,not_removed,check with your local city or town because most places have laws that pertain to door to door salesman and the need to register or obtain permission from the city asking if they obtained permission to conduct business that way may scare them if not call the police
LifeProTips,not_removed,clearly state your feeling threatened then call police get the gun if possible then go inside dont forget the pup and watch the harassment law go to work sorry but im assuming american problem as i dont know international law
LifeProTips,not_removed,at such a point directly state they are to immediately leave my property get my dog go into my house close the door get my gun call police tell them of the situation tell them i am locked in my home with my dog and i am armed police come remove dickheads if they begin to threaten my life before the police arrive well thats why i own a gun edit also shoot video of the incident from a safe location until police arrive
LifeProTips,not_removed,i said no again and to not make this difficult he took a step forward and asked what was i going to do about it he took a step forward and asked what was i going to do about it he took a step forward and asked what was i going to do about it seems like a very nonthreatening individual shouldve invited them in for tea and scones
LifeProTips,not_removed,close door get into your samuraiknight armor brandish the sword you got at dragonexpo and yell none shall pass or just call the cops thats a better solution
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont argue with these people politely ask them to leave your property i did this as a security guard when i was very young on a college campus found them again on another part of the property and politely asked them again to leave a short time later i found them again and politely asked them to leave at that time i called the police but had name lic plate went to court and every time i mentioned that i again asked them to leave the judge got madder madder slip that phrase politely in as often as you can ignore their questions dont be baited if they harass threaten or touch you the charges are higher
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres always the consuela approach nnnnoooo nnnnooooi no buyslowly close door
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,easy mr magnum here says get lost or get dead one of the very few things i like about living in the south you dont have to put up with scumbags causing you trouble on your property

LifeProTips,not_removed,alot of people saying call the police are obviously used to the city where police can be minutes away and they also think that everyone is so afraid of the cops they will just run off rural towns where police are not minutes away not smart some small towns in texas i know of do not even have local police and rely on county or state police who arent even an hour response time i see it the same as predatorprey scenario people want to paint the picture of the sad poor oppressed criminal and talk about what we should and shouldnt do in these situations when the truth is if a dude is bold enough to step up to me on my porch unprovoked damned right im bringing out the claws and showing my teeth this is not a pretty civil utopia as some would want us to think and depending on the police is just too unreliable my rules of engagement escalation of force i would have personally gone in the house shut the door to draw the physical line between me and them unholster gun say though the door i am not interested and to please exit my property if still an issue rack a round and then tell them to leave if they did not comply with my request say any attempt to enter my house or anything else towards me will be considered a threat and i will shoot to kill then get on the phone with the cops and make them aware of the situation if at any point in that situation they tried to break through that physical barrier between me and them or of they tried attempted attack before i got in obviously its time to start swingin and shootin luckily it didnt turn into anything for you and all is well obviously but it could have easily turned into a forced entry robbery murder odds say you would have been ok but i personally feel if there is a chance of me getting killed i am going to take the precaution to ensure i dont become a victim

LifeProTips,not_removed,the correct answer depends on what state you live in
LifeProTips,not_removed,close the door in their face simple as that if they force their way into the house kill them i dont know where your from but if someone forces their way into someones house without their permission id see that as having every right to kill them if they were a danger to you in any way or you felt threatened id stab or bludgeon the shit outta them if that was the case the only problem after that would be getting rid of the bodies
LifeProTips,not_removed,id have gotten real loud real quick this will alert the neighbors and potentially intimidate the magazine salesmen if that doesnt do the trick id go inside call the police and make sure my pistol was handy in the meantime
LifeProTips,not_removed,obviously you dont open the door in the first place i wont even answer the intercom if i dont feel like it guests will only visit after we agreed on a time and date i dont take packages for the neighbors and my wife and me know when a parcel is about to arrive if the police wants to talk to me they can send me a letter because i only give written statements from my lawyer and not any other way the real answer is it depends on where you live i had people in the house going from apartment to apartment and when they reached mine i escorted them out of the house and told them to individually call every intercom and that they had no business being in the house by themselves only when invited by individual residents i had schoolkids do a survey also going from apartment to apartment and the big one was really mouthy and basically demanded that i take part in it and started to ask why i didnt want to ask for names credentials and tell them that they are trespassing and that you will call the police if they dont leave immediately if you live in a rural area where calling the police isnt that much of an option you might want to have a weapon nearby when answering the door in this case youd tell them firmly to leave the property and if they dont back of a few feet and grabdraw your weapon but pointing it at the floor only point guns at people if you actually intent to shoot them i also have my entrance and the whole apartment btw on cctv so everyone who stands in the door immediately knows that hes on camera and that there will be no arguing over what actually happened and what was spoken even with two to one people present i really recommend having a camera visibly pointing at the entrance wouldbe robbers who try to check the situation will know that their face is on camera and so will everyone else that makes most unsolicited visitors go away by itself

LifeProTips,not_removed,it would depend on where you are but in most cases a rule of thumb is the law favors you on your property thats why an experienced thug would call you out to the curb if they really wanted to fight with that said youd only be able to use the minimum force to resolve the situation basically if you punch an unarmed person on your own property you should be good same applies if you use a weapon against an armed aggressor on your property or if you can show that you were uncertain if they were armed in a way that may have cost your life to verify even brandishing a weapon against an unarmed aggressor might be acceptable if its not used

LifeProTips,not_removed,what happens if they wont let you close the door or they attack you
LifeProTips,not_removed,but it sounds like the dog may have been in danger and it takes time for cops to arrive even mins is a long time in a dangerous situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,the title of this thread makes no sense to me op made it sound as though some strangers moved in and wouldnt leave the strangers were just two scumbags trying to make a fast dollar i never open my door to people i dont recognize and i have a no soliciting sign on my door its as simple as ignoring people like that i live on a busy street and occasionally i get solicitors but not often i can clearly see them through my front window but they cant see me because the window is tinted i also have a dog that barks when the doorbell rings a big dog
LifeProTips,not_removed,close the door and rack the slide of your gauge you cant get in trouble for brandishing if they cant see it but the sound should scare off all but the most idiotic intruder
LifeProTips,not_removed,im gonna piggy back off this and get down voted to hell for what im about to say you clearly felt uncomfortable with their presence from the get go yet you engaged not only did you engage but you did it in an inflammatory way you agitated the situation for both parties by essentially telling them you didnt support their shitty cause which is totally fine if you are willing to deal with an awkward situation you clearly werent and have since taken to the net to avoid future awkward encounters next time when you see someone approaching that makes you uncomfortable defuse one word answers non specific and confident nah man sorry i got nothing walk to backyardinside to do something back to your question once you ask someone to leave your property they no longer have a right to be there you may use a reasonable degree of force to remove them but it doesnt sound like youre interested in using it you could go all clint eastwood in gran torino on them but is it really necessary to threaten a life because someone is standing in your yard belligerently yelling obscenities maybe although we have cops that get paid to deal with that also just to touch on the gun comments it really depends on the laws of your countrystateprovince a farmer in canada was charged and convicted for shooting at two dudes that were on his land stealing his atv police charged the farmer because they determined there was no way for him to access the gun in time had it been stored according to canadian regulations

LifeProTips,not_removed,i would argue that if you think someone is questionable do not reopen the door it is not your job to stall him for the cops and youve significantly increased the risk to yourself this is worse if no one else is in the house how do you know he hasnt got two friends standing round the corner ready to raid through the open door the second he guesses its just you in there point is you cant tell if its a conman or a straight up thug who has no problem with physical violence
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh jesus christ reading all this gives me a sick feeling when i was my parents werent home and this creepy but friendly guy came to our door he was super shady and kinda pushy he was selling magazines so he claimed for all i know it was legit but what i did next was so stupid i shudder i let him inside the house while my parents were gone i was so stupid i dont know what came over me luckily my parents came home a few minutes later but i shudder just thinking about what could have happened i was a petite year old girl my parents didnt even address the dangers of what i had done in fact i havent given this memory much thought since it happened holy shit

LifeProTips,not_removed,rural towns where police are not minutes away not smart some small towns in texas i know of do not even have local police and rely on county or state police who arent even an hour response time i see it the same as predatorprey scenario people want to paint the picture of the sad poor oppressed criminal and talk about what we should and shouldnt do in these situations when the truth is if a dude is bold enough to step up to me on my porch unprovoked damned right im bringing out the claws and showing my teeth this is not a pretty civil utopia as some would want us to think and depending on the police is just too unreliable
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah the people saying to pull a gun on these guys are incredibly misinformed about not only the law but also the term lethal force and its implications i have a chl and multiple firearms myself but this is ridiculous guns should never enter the picture in this situation unless they started attacking him or breaking into his house

LifeProTips,not_removed,notice he said kill them not shoot them and injure them unfortunate as it is leaving an injured intruder alive looks a lot worse in court looks more like your life wasnt really being threatened if you didnt shoot to kill
LifeProTips,not_removed,could be if you have it signed clearly but the only thing youll see like that in suburbia is a no solicitors sign im sure someone has managed to get at least a hand slap for repeatedly ignoring those when its financially in their interest
LifeProTips,not_removed,this depends on living conditions however if you live somewhere where the closest appropriate leo is minutes away you might just have to yell at them or even threaten them to get them to leave ive lived in bumfuck nowhere it happens sometimes
LifeProTips,not_removed,id love to help but im saving every penny for something what are you saving for a trip to ireland in fact while your here would you be interested in buying some home made jewellery aw forget this well go next door no please its good stuff ill do you a special deal just for you look we havent sold may magazines and cant afford it today were leaving now and if you follow us well call the police awaahhhh a curse on both of you win
LifeProTips,not_removed,or the ol let me check if the wife is interestedlet me get my checkbook whatever its a pretty simple exchange to get inside without being aggressive
LifeProTips,not_removed,look i get that they seemed shitty and all that and i love gun talks and self defense as much as the next guy but how do i get out of this awkward social situation has so many better answers refusing to leave the property is a little more serious than an awkward situation but i agree with you anyway if your first instinct when someone is being stubborn is to go for your gun then maybe you should reconsider owning firearms
LifeProTips,not_removed,how do i get out of this awkward social situation has so many better answers anyone suggesting that he goes and gets a gun and waves it around is an idiot i mean hey itd be cool as shit to show off your or or something and watch the guys beat feet but its overall a terrible idea that said the gun should always be there to reinforce plan a plan a is to close and lock the door plan b is where the gun comes into play such as they stick their foot in the door or try to force their way in or try to harm your dog
LifeProTips,not_removed,why do that when op can stretch out the story to get karma on reddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i solicit doortodoor for charity and am basically trained to handle pretty much every objection thrown at me and explain why that objection isnt valid so the person will still sign up you wanna know what objections i pretty much never try to get past and just move on someone close to me just diedwas diagnosed with a serious disease and ive already had to cancel all my superfluous spending because we have a lot of bills on the way pretty much the only thing aside from a door being shut in my face or screaming at me to leave that will instantly send me on my way
LifeProTips,not_removed,as far as ive understood this thread could be summarized with op halp some people scared me what should ive done most comments you shouldve aimed three shotguns at them and told them to fuck off before you killed them and their families and then proceeded to eat them all a few comments uuh call the police like a normal person
LifeProTips,not_removed,hours
LifeProTips,not_removed,just remember the castle doctrine is not just something you scream after you shoot someone and everyones like yea cool its a legal defense you can bring up and hope the judge and jury think you followed its exact definition appropriately also its generally agreed that within the walls of your house you can claim defense but just being on your property can be less cut and dry
LifeProTips,not_removed,pretty sure if they are trying to disarm you then you can shoot them in any state
LifeProTips,not_removed,i will not be harassed in my own private domicile bitch
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i want to know if they ever got to go to ireland

LifeProTips,not_removed,to me it was painfully obvious that this story as are most on reddit was completely made up
LifeProTips,not_removed,i said no magazines if you want i can ask bertha pulls out broadsword but i dont think shes interested either
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless they have a gun never bring a knife even a really long and shiny one to a gun fight its like youve never seen raiders of the lost ark

LifeProTips,not_removed,he probably bought magazines
LifeProTips,not_removed,please tell your wife to never open the door to strangers i am a retired lady and there is no way in hell i am opening my door to anyone i dont recognize its a good thing you were home that day no telling what would have happened
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless the two men bum rush you after that
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had no idea people were still selling kirby vacuums
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol based
LifeProTips,not_removed,you dont provoke random strangers especially in a secluded area when there are multiples and one already near one of your defenseless family members dog because his real intentions may come out and hes actually casing the joint for later on tonight but now you just pissed him off so the guy playing with the dog kills it so it doesnt bark and the guy at the door pushes through and grabs you hopefully you were smart enough to get your concealed carry license and you put rounds in his chest before he kills your family and robs your house
LifeProTips,not_removed,i live in a rural area where response time is glacial also but i still call you never know an officer may be a few miles away and at the very least you have put the incident on record get a photo of them if you can i also tell unwanted people they are being recorded by security cameras maybe the cops get there an hour after they leave but maybe those guys have caused problems with your neighbors the cops might decide to patrol your area and might catch them later i dont know about all areas but in my state we are expected to use reasonable means to protect ourselves and deadly force after all other means are exhausted i have called about an intruder and it took hour for the sheriff to reach me but the supervisor kept me on the line the entire time the recorded conversation might have been used as evidence if things went south turns out it was a neighbor kid glomming onto our wifi😀
LifeProTips,not_removed,i tell ya people who do the doortodoor scams have a lot of balls i would never do anything like this they have no clue who is behind that door and if they have a gun or not which more and more people have these days they dont know if theres a psycho person living there just waiting for someone to try and scam them so they can subdue them tie them up and keep them in the basement im sure this has happened
LifeProTips,not_removed,you sir are bona fide
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can draw on them depending on the state when the law states you can use force that means you can draw when it says deadly force like if they try and swing at you you can ventilate them
LifeProTips,not_removed,hopefully right riiiight
LifeProTips,not_removed,redditors would rather commit double homicide then have a social interaction for a few seconds
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a woman too and live alone with my big dog i never open my door to strangers in fact they cant even see me but i can see them my front window is tinted because the front of my house faces the west and it gets really hot in the afternoon i can clearly see who is standing on my front porch i dont use my front door and have it very secured from the inside plus i have furniture up against it because my living room is small i have another door where my truck is parked but some people dont see it there is a large plant in front of the front door so clearly this door isnt used not only that i have a no soliciting sign on that door none of these things seem to bother people who ring the doorbell they cant seem to get a clue that there is a large plant in front of the door so how in the hell could i even use that door plus they ignore the sign i can talk to them through the door though but like i said they cant see me my big dog always barks when someone rings the doorbell or knocks but that doesnt seem to deter these people either i tell these people through the door that im not interested and they leave
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont put my seatbelt on because i live in constant fear of car crashes i do it in case a car crash happens same for gun ownership
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not at all like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive lived all over the us and have been on my own for years what ive noticed is that in areas that have poor to almost nonexistent police response that the number of strangers coming to your door is pretty high by coincidence these are typically poor areas go figure cant say that all that many are dangerous but they can be rude and intimidating which is tough on old folks especially btw those cute neighborhood watch signs make no difference at all is a giveaway that police response is slow yes answering the door with a in your hand is a pretty good way to go especially if you yell what the fuck do you want in their face discourages most of them especially the god squad types and i think a person is an idiot if they dont have a peep hole in the door or a video camera intercoms are cool dont even have to open the door to find out why they are there america runs on paranoia and fear proof d trump
LifeProTips,not_removed,its really not too bad just huge the people we worry about are very small in number but help can be a long way off depending on where you live i grew up a mile back on a dirt road that was miles from the nearest police station population of the area so low that there were only cops lots of hidden meth labs in the woods though and sometimes bad people took advantage of help being so far away its assumed that everyone answers the door with a gun because help wont make it to you hell the neighbors are too far away to hear you scream the one time someone did have a problem on my road it was a heart attack the ambulance got stuck in the mud since it was rainy season the ems guys walked while my dad pulled the ambulance the rest of the way with a tractor hospital was minutes away too
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol maaaaybe in certain parts of large cities like new york or well all of detroit in small towns throughout the midwest and the south theyre typically well mannered and super friendly big city folk can be suspicious of them for being too kind
LifeProTips,not_removed,its either crazy pills or a bit of ignorance about human behavior which is understandable if youve never dealt with violent people since op cites direct actions the guy took to threaten him it does not seem like he is exaggerating or some mental issue that would cause him to hallucinate a direct threat to his safety the fact op is still thinking about this incident years later is indicative of how threatened he felt and millions of years of evolution have finely tuned most peoples instincts to react to exactly this kind of situation so unless you want to assume op has mental illness im going to trust their gut over your sheltered world view and a lot of people drool at the thought of a potential murderer getting shot in the head because it means one less that could potentially threaten them or their family this incident may not have ended in violence because in the backandforth with op they may have decided op was too much trouble to deal with but what if they spotted weakness fraily or fear go up to a neighbors house and knock on their door take a step forward and threaten them verbally if the thought of that gives you anxiety or disturbs you enough to not do it then you do not understand the mental state of violent people who wouldnt think twice about escalating well beyond that point are you really asking people to rely on potentially violent strangers to determine their level safety thats like telling people who live in tornado alley not to have a storm cellar take action to protect yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless theyre selling gun magazines
LifeProTips,not_removed,most of the replies are hypotheticals not involving the real situation at hand but i agree the situation described should never have a gun involved there was no forceful entry through physical barriers nor any lethal force or viable threats put forth by the salesmen guns should never enter the picture here sincerely chl holder
LifeProTips,not_removed,when he aggressively asks what im going to do if he doesnt leave and advances on me hes crossing into use of force territory in my state at that point id likely draw sit him down and have the local constabulary give him a ride to a place that aint my house
LifeProTips,not_removed,deleted
LifeProTips,not_removed,you wouldnt feel threatened in that situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have always had this sign on my door and it has always been ignored a long time ago a young man came to my front door and i could see him through the window he was holding a clipboard and he seemed harmless enough so i went out on the porch before he could utter a word i pointed to the no soliciting sign and said did you see this he didnt say anything i said do you know what this means he still didnt say anything i then said it means that you are not allowed to knock on my door trying to sell me anything nor talk about jesus i then walked back inside and he left never saying a word
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is actually really important if you fear for your safety or life they can be charged with assault or criminal threat make sure you tell the officer taking the report that
LifeProTips,not_removed,and that youve got your fathers gun and a scorching case of herpes
LifeProTips,not_removed,and he has a high capacity magazine
LifeProTips,not_removed,trained dispatchers answer the call with where is your emergency this is because now with cell phones location data isnt accurate enough back when everyone only had land lines location information was very accurately transmitted through the protocol for medical calls after you give the address and the problem the dispatcher will ask additional questions if you live in an area with emd emergency medical dispatch they will ask questions like is the person breathing are they talking etc depending on the type of call they may give instructions for the caller prior to the arrival of the ambulance such as instructing the caller how to begin cpr emd also makes sure that the appropriate resources are sent to the emergency there are varying levels of training for ems personnel sadly most smaller towns dont have this which is where things like early cpr could mean the difference between life and death tldr dispatchers are usually very well trained and will ask questions to get the appropriate information from you dispatchers rarely get the recognition or thanks they deserve source former paramedic
LifeProTips,not_removed,the one time i had to call the operator gave me the youre an idiot tone because i did this she was like yes we know
LifeProTips,not_removed,you shoot them
LifeProTips,not_removed,try to defend yourself id say
LifeProTips,not_removed,then they get shot texas ftw
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats one of the many reasons i carry a gun ive had two separate occasions of people stopping me from closing my door and both times were thwarted by putting my hand on the pistol on my hip
LifeProTips,not_removed,murder obviously
LifeProTips,not_removed,not to mention they may target them at a later point too
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless they actually attack the dog then you wait for the cops if they try to hurt the dog then you can use reasonable force equal to the force they could use against you to defend your dog this is called defense of property in law if they attack you personally then the amount of force you can use depends on the state you live in some states have standyourground laws andor castle doctrines but short story unless youre using force in defense of property or selfdefense you cant use force to enforce laws such as trespass wait for the police
LifeProTips,not_removed,big dogs really are the best i have a pound mutt that is friendly as can be but if someone comes up to my door and i dont or cant give him any kind of cue how he should react he can look scary its perfect
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha my first thought was some kid hates moms boyfriends buddy and wants to know how to get him banned from dinner anyway yeah this reads like someone being a bit reckless not just in coming to the door but in his word choice after my stuff lollll how about sorry i gotta go
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont open the door thats how i deal with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,could you just have a big speaker mounted behind the door and play a sample through it play it over the door intercom ferris bueller style
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait you cant point a shotgun at trespassers why not
LifeProTips,not_removed,that only works if you are ready and willing to use the gun to shoot them
LifeProTips,not_removed,is brandishing even technically a concern on ones own property
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a guy that grew up in rural michigan knowing plenty of farmers the correct way to store a gun is loaded leaning in a corner by the door
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah but you dont understand its the people who come to your door who always want to make it awkward and intend to agitate if you dont do what they want who gives a fuck about making it awkward if the worst thing that can happen is you shut the door on some randoms and see if they leave and if not call the cops he doesnt owe any graces to people who try to sell him shit where i live theres this weird waterheater scam where they come to your door and say blablabla examining heater would you like my shoes off or on because they believe that thats a way to trick you into inviting them in i just told them no you cant come in they asked why said it was primarily because they are using some weird pushy sales tactic and i dont know why theyre immediately talking to me about their shoes he pretended not to understand and made it awkward but who cares
LifeProTips,not_removed,a farmer in canada was charged and convicted for shooting at two dudes that were on his land stealing his atv police charged the farmer because they determined there was no way for him to access the gun in time had it been stored according to canadian regulations victim blaming at its finest
LifeProTips,not_removed,you cant help but engage when someone comes to your door be a man and handle it dont hide like a child its your house tell them you said no respectfully good luck to them if they persist let them know cops will be there shortly if they dont get off your property also in my state you have the right to shoot if trespassers wont get off your property once asked not saying to shoot them just putting into perspective its your family your house your right no one will make me or my kids uncomfortable in my house maybe its helpful to judt have it on you just in case in that siutation bottom line is to do what you have to to protect your family
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes just back the truck up to the garage
LifeProTips,not_removed,big muscular guy small mouthy guy but girl scout cookies come on in
LifeProTips,not_removed,i will love him and hug him and pet him and squeeze him

LifeProTips,not_removed,i wanna pet the comment george
LifeProTips,not_removed,im gonna break them goddamn cats necks
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was thinking more along the lines of taking these two creeps to the magical warm place with green grass and shady trees where the bunny and mouse have ran off to
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was thinking it was gunna be a ruse the entire post was shocked when it wasnt
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the most stereotypical pairing of criminals ive ever heard yeah its pretty much just a description of george and lennie from of mice and men
LifeProTips,not_removed,was it these two guys
LifeProTips,not_removed,its cool you have a purse bro its ok
LifeProTips,not_removed,we havent had a long time to evolve around modern day situations so to allude to evolution as the reason it is editfinely tuned to such situations is well off the mark after having spent a couple years on my local facebook page i can tell you that trust your gut sounds like bad advice trusting your gut is exactly why a good looking tall charismatic blonde guy can continually get away with this trusting your gut is why honest salesmen who happen to be black are met with such immediate suspicion use your intellect and the ability to learn thats our strength we should have good idea of what is a questionable situation dont trust your gut it doesnt learn or analyze nearly as well as your brain
LifeProTips,not_removed,not that you shouldnt do it but id care i guess lots of fake stories with pics of real people going viral lately
LifeProTips,not_removed,our apartment complex was repeatedly being hounded by some shadylooking guys in a tooexpensiveforthearea car chevy escalade they visited once on the pretense of selling magazines they returned less than a week later and only visited the apartments of women it went on and on for weeks and i got so annoyed they would bang on our door and if you didnt answer theyd yell we can hear your tv and wouldnt go away we routinely called the cops who were always minutes away at best and the cops never could catch the guys the girls above us and other ladiesonly apartments all got to discussing it a few times and a few asked their dads over to hang out during the dinnerevening hours just in case something happened finally one night i got so tired of it i stepped out my door with the guy bad idea for a skinny girl with no selfdefense training pulled out a camera and took a picture magically the visits stopped immediately we never saw those guys again i told the apartment manager who was never there after and absolutely useless about the whole mess that i had a picture of the guy if someones apartment was broken into this was actually a very nice complex but some drunken idiot had drove their car into our gate and management wouldnt fix it for months so any asshole off the street could drive in and case the place ugh so glad i dont live in an apartment complex anymore
LifeProTips,not_removed,we called the cops but the response time was just over minutes they didnt grab a statement or stop by just cruised the neighborhood in the general direction we initially told them we saw the guy take off in i talked to my landlord a few years later he said he hadnt seen the guy or heard anything from current tenants but that the cops had nailed one or two people doing the same bs it was a richer neighborhood with easier freeway access i dont in anyway condone vigilantiasm that isnt actually selfdefense but police response time here in the states is a joke and really needs to be higher priority
LifeProTips,not_removed,please answer this question
LifeProTips,not_removed,did they
LifeProTips,not_removed,this absolutely we only did so because we were three early men with a dog the guy wasnt visibly armed and our landlord knew the scheme but yes better safe than sorry especially if youre alone or outnumbered
LifeProTips,not_removed,my sister did this some guys selling vacuums came to the door my three sisters and i were home alone my oldest sister was probably at the time and let these guys into our house us other sisters spied on the top of the stairs too afraid to go downstairs thankfully my mother comes home while theyre demonstrating the vacuum ive never heard her scream louder or be as scary as she was in that moment when kicking the guys out
LifeProTips,not_removed,have you gotten smarter since that time
LifeProTips,not_removed,its okay when i was i had an email relationship with a year old man who straight up said he would have sex with me and had looked up my full name and hometown i got scared and told my dad and he was just like dont do that stupid year old me
LifeProTips,not_removed,one winter when i was a kid we had a guy at our door wanting to come inside and use our phone he claimed he was with a group and their snowmobiles had run out of gas or something cant recall it was pretty late and it was just my mom and i living there by ourselves and we were out in the country my mom was very insistent he would not come into the house he kept trying to push his way in and she wouldnt let him she told him if he wants to use the phone she will bring it to him this was before cellphones were common and he can use it outside the door he refused and kept trying to come in its cold out here etc eventually after several minutes of this he gave up my mom had me fetch the phone he used it outside the house and left i didnt realize how scary that situation was until years later but looking back on it now that i understand the situation i am totally proud of how my mom handled that one she was not budging
LifeProTips,not_removed,can you explain to me what vet a sting means not a native english speaker and even if i can make a guess id like it if someone could tell me
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup they dont want it circulating and multiple business cards means multiple accusationscharges when you get caught edit wrdz
LifeProTips,not_removed,its also very useful if you need to dig a tiny hole
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if they reply with wheres my money bitch
LifeProTips,not_removed,nobody can deliver a bitch like jesse pinkman
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont fake having a gun if this guy has a weapon itll trigger him to grab his if you actually have a gun its one thing but dont bluff on that shit itll escalate it and then youre the guy with his dick is in his hand and hell have a gun
LifeProTips,not_removed,theyre not forgetting they dont care
LifeProTips,not_removed,user name checks out
LifeProTips,not_removed,great idea but unfortunately in good ole canada pepper spray is illegal some genius lawmakers decided it was right up there with
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly i grew up in a tiny town known for massive amounts of meth labs and no police force within an hours drive i was a latch key kid with a gun
LifeProTips,not_removed,i suspect its less about those poor criminals and more about deescalating a situation and not making things riskier for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i often think of this i live on a county road miles from town the problem is that town is in the neighboring county country line is right outside of town so i have to call the country sheriff minutes away if anything goes wrong im screwed if someone breaks in
LifeProTips,not_removed,hear hear grew up in a rural town myself if someone had the intestinal fortitude to threaten me on my property they could at a minimum expect remarkably similar discourse in kind also nobody messes with my dog d
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the same message as i had in my very first post on reddit eastern ky rather than tx but same issue and same solution
LifeProTips,not_removed,police are too overworked here in a town with pop over i lived in the woods near a highway one night i hear cops radio on the highway down below house station was trying to reach him doing laundry windows open doors unlocked my dog all of a sudden lays down on the floor and pees all overcowering i then get this overwhelming sense of imminent danger drop laundry and run to back door on deck to lock it and feel the handle turn from the other side as i fumble to lock itgot it locked and ran to windows slamming them then remembered garage door open too knew at this point i was in deeper trouble small female no gun and ran to my closet to hide and call police as i stood in my closet shaking with dog at feet i lost my mind started screaming i am going to kill you first you mf and her i come think signs when alien on the roof of the house and grabbed a cast iron pan from range and ran out the garage man door into the driveway screaming and banging the pan on shit as i ran the guy took off running i could here the leaves from the madrone trees crunching and i continued to run after him for a little bit then turned around and went in house and locked it up and called cops he had shot the officer for no reason he is in prison now bottom line act crazy funny what overwhelming fear can do to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep this i grew uplive in a populated suburb police response time is usually pretty quick minutes tops however a lot can happen in five minutes and i really hate my states draconian gun laws because of it cant imagine living farther away from police
LifeProTips,not_removed,utopia is from the greek words that mean no place d i live in a rural town where driving distance might mean minutes for the county but it takes far less time for me to be armed protecting myself
LifeProTips,not_removed,shit living in jacksonville florida i called the cops one time hour response time it took me about seconds to grab the gun every time after that
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep where i live the town cops are parttime and we have to rely on county deputies and state police who can be more than minutes away at times if strangers approach i dont answer the door until ive packed my peace
LifeProTips,not_removed,its so weird seeing such pro gun bros talk like their tough claws show teeth when really theyre hiding behind a gun because they are too scared that mr mean man is on their porch and they dont know what to do look im ccw license owner and i love my i get the point of having a gun but fuck me if everyone thinks its appropriate to pull one because they feel a little bit threatened americans sound like such huge pussies in this thread the correct answer to this question is close and lock the door if they dont leave call the police if they forcefully try to break in your house then thats a whole different story and even if these idiots were hardened criminals theres still a small small percent chance theyd try to break into your house knowing youre home and not a complete pushover be smart about owning a gun please
LifeProTips,not_removed,grew up in a tiny town in texas graduating class was ppl in such rural towns you dont have people selling magazines and everyone has a gun at least in texas
LifeProTips,not_removed,im in kentucky which is protected by the castle doctrine you can legally pull a gun assuming its for your own safety within your home or you car and you can even shoot to kill if you are attacked legally
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds about right my wallet got stolen left it somewhere once so i called the hotel that showed up on my credit card statement and they gave me more than enough info to catch the thief went to the police station and told them everything and never heard back i also know someone whose house was broken into they called the cops and without even conducting a thorough investigation they just pinned it on his year old son the person i know argued about it until eventually they just had to ask the police to leave im not a cop hater by any means but i empathize with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,similar for me too family member in east san jose called about a group going car to car smashing windows and was told to file an insurance claim called again about the guys having weapons and threatening people was told officers were on the way and the next day got a call asking if anything happened in sunnyvale i called the non emergency line for a hit and run on a parked car and officers arrived in minutes they were happy to write the report and apologetic about us having to deal with getting it repaired
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is how tax dollars are supposed to work correct me if im wrong but i have a feeling palo alto has quite a few more tax dollars per capita to spend on things like firetrucks than san jose does its the same story in any wealthy jurisdiction
LifeProTips,not_removed,palo altan here those are the perks of paying most of your take home to your mortgage
LifeProTips,not_removed,obviously drunk guy rear ended me at a red light in san francisco thankfully it just scratched the paint on the bumper of my old ass acura sfpd comes and checks our info turns out the guy that hit me had his license suspended for drunk driving ends up just letting him off without even a warning wtf police
LifeProTips,not_removed,whoa my area is on reddit mountain view resident here
LifeProTips,not_removed,my car was stolen and the police never came eventually i found a recovered my car myself
LifeProTips,not_removed,san jose cas police department has been severely understaffed for a couple years now ever since i believe a local politician pushed forward new policies that gutted their compensation and benefits officers transferred to other cities shortly afterwards and it went so far that some police chiefs from other cities explicitly recommended that people not transfer there when employment requests came in why would an officer want to work in a city that pays less and offers fewer benefits than all other similar metros across the state not to mention the high cost of living there source friends with a few former sjpd staff
LifeProTips,not_removed,how many callsofficer do you think there are in san jose compared to palo alto how much money do you think san jose has compared to palo alto for each resident of the cities
LifeProTips,not_removed,even the threat of calling police will work for most people if theyre not most people make a lot of noise to draw unwanted attention and be prepared to fight dirty at that point they are illegal trespassers no shame in going for the nutties
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes or wait for them to do something illegal and then take action to stop them making sure not to exceed what is a reasonable amount of force for the situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre killin me smalls
LifeProTips,not_removed,also a solid strategy in florida
LifeProTips,not_removed,looks more like your life wasnt really being threatened if you didnt shoot to kill ive heard this a million times but never actually seen any examples of it in reality
LifeProTips,not_removed,frankly i just dont want there to be a possibility of revenge let them die
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you live in bfn you should take certain security measures into your own hands alarm system accessible firearm for selfdefense one of those nice steel plate antikicking door locks and the chain lock as well dont open your door to strangers maybe have a security camera or a trail cam nearby you can get motion detecting alarms that chime when triggered prevents anyone from sneaking up on your property have no trespassing signs posted in visible locations lots of options
LifeProTips,not_removed,tell them youre squatting so they dont think theres anything nice inside to take
LifeProTips,not_removed,until they follow you as you enter your home thats a big part of why its a twoman crew the little one is the mouth keeps you busy and off balance the big one is the muscle who capitalizes on any presented opportunity
LifeProTips,not_removed,all of his reactions are totally fair though lying and trying to be polite in the face of someone elses blatant rudeness on your own property might be the best way to potentially end the confrontation completely and get rid of them but i dont think his reaction was in any way harsh or abnormal these clearly arent normal door to door salesman normal door to door salesmen arent that insistent and rude usually and if they are youre perfectly entitled to tell them to fuck right off if someones doesnt want to buy something you dont ask more times and you dont ask them about their own personal finances if he treats jws like he treats these people then he probably treats them better than average my reactions to them vary from laughter and amusement to just down right ignoring them coming to someones door to tell them about your little fantasy is pretty taboo too if you ask me down right weird
LifeProTips,not_removed,those lovely jehovahs still remember how my dad yelled at them that there is only one god and that is him they never came back
LifeProTips,not_removed,the dont make this difficult escalated it i think no thanks over and over and refusal to get into the whys is the neutral route
LifeProTips,not_removed,i said no again and to not make this difficult he took a step forward and asked what was i going to do about it thats not just stubbornness thats an implied threat
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes hours whats he going to do stand there for hours even if he did after hours you just call the cops and say theres some weirdo who has been standing on my porch for hours and refuses to leave winwin
LifeProTips,not_removed,this varies widely by state and castle doctrine can also be a major determining factor in whether you are even arrested or if charges are filed police and das have a lot of discretion in castle doctrine and stand your ground jurisdictions that said this is a legal question and a lawyer is where op should be looking for answers cheers
LifeProTips,not_removed,which is going to vary by state here in alaska use of deadly force in defense of self and others only hinges on whether or not you were legally allowed to be where you were and if you were in mutual combat with the person attempted to retreat first my front porch the grocery store my bedroom all the same rules apply my tldr in my head for alaska is rape the forceful kind rape of a minor any robbery in any degree kidnappingunless it is part of a custody dispute and anything that could result in a serious injury to me or someone else alaska case law has serious injury to mean pretty much any sort of violent assault as blows to the head can kill etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,i declare castle doctrine
LifeProTips,not_removed,even a state of confusion
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think he meant dont draw on someone unless you are mentally prepared to fire on them basically dont draw and then puss out

LifeProTips,not_removed,pretty sure its slam the door open the door get on the floor everybody walk the dinosaur
LifeProTips,not_removed,mine just happens to be a cz
LifeProTips,not_removed,that wouldnt be an issue as we would have made some tea by then tea calms any situation down we still havent forgiven you godless heathens for tipping that tea into the harbour
LifeProTips,not_removed,dammed leeches considering ops situation i would have called the police too but only after ensuring i was in a safe position to do so and that means inside my house with door closed and gun unholstered its not paranoia as some would say but it is an agressive defensive posture that ensures i can easily gain the upper hand if things went south while odds say im safe it does no harm to take extra precautions imo not like im gonna pull it out and point it at their head sitting on the porch
LifeProTips,not_removed,shoot first ask questions later
LifeProTips,not_removed,sick bro totally draw a deadly weapon on a dude because he said some words
LifeProTips,not_removed,also people should know about preemptive striking if somebody squares up to you and you feel intimidated you have the right to hit them should you believe that they will hit you i once had a guy that squared up to me while screaming in my face road rage case and i just hit him which was my first reaction im not proud that it was my reaction but it was anyway a fight ensues someone then got out of their car and started dragging me away while letting the guy hit me this guy said i started it by punching him and he called the police i had a broken nose a chipped tooth and a lot of bruising im not exactly the best fighter in the world and this guy had me in a full nelson whilst the other punched me i had them both done for assault and they both got arrested as it was being filmed by the second guys girlfriend edit just check the laws for where you live first always do this when you see somebody saying a law especially on the internet sometimes people are misled andor confused so why take the first persons word for it or we might all end up following somebody who has been mislead and trouble may unsue
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is a secondary reason the main reason is that dispatch triages reports and officers respond to the most exigent first if you report that you are in danger the report will treated at a higher priority
LifeProTips,not_removed,you just loaded that song into my head and hit play

LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly invite them inside so you can kill them and dispose of the scum fucks its the only way to save puppy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a pit bull mix whos a total lap dog but definitely has an intimidating bark i was walking him through the park late at night and a car with three guys in it slows down to match my walking pace i nudge him a couple of times and say speak hoping that theyll scare away but he just cocked his head and looked up at me like a doofus worst guard dog ever
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my experience a lb buck goat in rut is a better deterrent
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes they are my dog isnt friendly hes never bitten anyone but because he is half great pyrenees he is very suspicious of strangers and he will always get between them and me even if its someone i know every time the ac guy comes to do a service check my dog will get between the two of us and either stand there or lay down my dog barks at him every time he feels like it my dog wont let anyone pet him even if hes seen the person a million times he loves my son of course but didnt like anyone my son brought over even when my dog is out in the backyard and he sees someone trying to talk to him my dog will stand about two feet away from the fence and bark continuously at them my sons dog is a pure great pyrenees and she used to live here i was her foster mom until my son adopted her she has the loudest bark of any dog i have ever heard and she barks at everything ugh she is beautiful and when she was here she would go outside with my dog and the two of them would wander around my yard is quite large and fenced in my sons dog would stand up and lean on the fence if someone walked by so they would come over and pet her but my dog would just stand there and bark at them she isnt as good of a guard dog as my dog is however the two of them together make a menacing looking team
LifeProTips,not_removed,my mum always says you should never open the door an unopened door is a happy door so we never open ours when someone knocks
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless i know someone is coming i dont even check to see who it is anymore all my friends will just call or text to let me know im there anyway i live in nyc and one time i had to walk down flights of stairs to tell someone im not interested never again
LifeProTips,not_removed,sure but if they decide to be idiots and escalate its easier to dispatch them with an actual gauge than with a speaker
LifeProTips,not_removed,canadian regulations unloaded locked in an approved gun safe which is properly bolted to the floor or structural wall separate from the ammunition which must also be locked up edit i have been corrected the law is less restrictive than i indicated my sincerest apologies i was raised that the method described was the law
LifeProTips,not_removed,not always depends on the size of the gun some can be kept in a drawer these are good for snakes or for buying time while you go to get the real gun
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a farmer and i guess im doing it wrong mine are all unloaded in a padlocked cabinet
LifeProTips,not_removed,obviously vampires fishing for an invitation
LifeProTips,not_removed,victim blaming at its finest maybe that farmer shouldnt have had his atv so its mudflaps were bare for all the world to see like a common streetwhore he was practically asking for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,there were victims and crimes
LifeProTips,not_removed,except we now have laws that more support heightened self defense and citizens arrest httpwwwnationalpostcommwpbloghtmlbnewsnationalpostcomtorontoluckymoosebillloosensselfdefencecitizensarrestlaws
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh sweetie youve hit the jackpot go get your friends youre definitely going to disney world this year
LifeProTips,not_removed,my first impression was these arent girl scouts but then i realized i was being biased against them i was being ageist assuming that because they looked old that they were not also there is no reason they couldnt identify as a little girl
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought thats where this was going and it was a joke lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,not the home alone wet bandits
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought the same thing immediately checked ops username
LifeProTips,not_removed,it means they may be criminals themselves posting this question in an attempt to see how people could react basically theyre planning on running a sting and want to get an idea of what theythe homeowner can get away with i dont actually think they are just explaining this guys point
LifeProTips,not_removed,basically checking if their own robbery plan is foolproof
LifeProTips,not_removed,so eat the intruder
LifeProTips,not_removed,i need to save your words forever i need them embossed in gold lettering on a set of a thousand black business cards so that i can just respond to people who say trust your gut by handing them the card giving them a look of disapproval and moving on with my day instinct is something that every living thing has fucking amoebas have instinct we are the only creature on the planet capable of complex deductive reasoning when given a choice in problemsolving technique if one of the techniques resulted in manned spaceflight use that one
LifeProTips,not_removed,true but every picture taken with every cameraphone on the planet is a target for that having a picture stops a wouldbe home invader burglar pretty quickly they know exactly why youre taking the picture and causing trouble at that location now or at any point in the future is going to put them in ridiculous jeopardy people with picturessurveillance of wrongdoers makes the polices job times easier not only in locating the perpetrators but in conviction rates
LifeProTips,not_removed,had someone try to break into our apartment one night had my wife hide in the closet and call the police while i stood by the door with my personal firearm in case they had made a third attempt to bust the door in dispatch tells my wife that were being overly concerned since we have a deadbolt on the apartment door i think this is horseshit because a door can still be kicked in even when its deadboltedhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtbdiayvpdam mins later a police car cruises by now this is in a major urban area our specific apartment complex had been subject to multiple breakins that month cops didnt even stop by for a statement i literally watched them drive past our door and then turn out of the complex i still cant help but get mad that i couldnt even rely on the police the one time in my life that ive felt like i actually needed them
LifeProTips,not_removed,police response time is a good reason to own a gun face it in an emergency the cops will never get there in time its too big a country and theres just too few police best case minutes which is still a long time more realistic is realizing this is why im arming myself
LifeProTips,not_removed,he is the guy from his story
LifeProTips,not_removed,to vet is to test your theory or plan for problems a sting would in this sense be a crime against someone else although usually a sting is an ambush set up by the police to catch criminals hes saying op may be using this thread to figure out how to commit a crime rather than how to prevent himself from being the victim of one
LifeProTips,not_removed,setting up a series of action towards one or multiple victims and preparing in advance to defend myself if shit happens english is not my my native language either i just watch too much tv
LifeProTips,not_removed,it is being suggested that op is going to use the information from the replies to better scam people because op is actually the scam artist trying to master the craft by being able to counter the popular suggestions on this post
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikivetting it has basically come to mean to check ie checking the usefulnessefficacy if he sets up this imaginary sting situation on the internet and of the people immediately go oh thats fucking stupid who would ever do that its no good but if he gets some feedback like oh thats evil i could see myself falling for that well then its go time
LifeProTips,not_removed,have you seen gran torino
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you have a weapon the other person should never know until youre prepared to actually use it intending to just intimidate someone with a weapon is a great way to have it taken from you
LifeProTips,not_removed,for number i think the question was asking if there are stories of the solicitors coming back for revenge for calling the cops
LifeProTips,not_removed,frankly i trust my dog to get out of a situation like that a lot more than i trust myself besides trying not to sound too snarky if your dog wont come when called then maybe you need to put a few hours in training your dog
LifeProTips,not_removed,there are certain things you have to prioritize a human life outweighs a dog plus my dog is gonna do a hell of a lot better job fending off an attacker than i will be able to unarmed
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive always found that ridiculous there are rational arguments for limiting access to guns a lethal weapon but none whatsoever for limiting access to pepper spray a nonlethal weapon unless of course you simply dont want people to be capable of defending themselves when attacked
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive heard of using raid the roach killer as an alternative
LifeProTips,not_removed,baseball bats are legal though and still give a good reach
LifeProTips,not_removed,kill em and hide the bodies then yall have plenty of hungry critters up there and the cold will preserve the bodies a bit longer for consumption
LifeProTips,not_removed,utah
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes stepping in the house and shutting the door helps teeth and claws analogy is not bring out the gun it is maintain an aggressive posture of im not fucking arouns and please leave but if a person means you harm you have seconds to act not have a conversation
LifeProTips,not_removed,where im from not america the police are a long ways away while i dont advocate pulling a gun whillynilly or even at all you do what you have to do
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude didnt even mention a gun
LifeProTips,not_removed,the rules of deadly force usually state that a gun is to be pulled only when shoot to kill is necessary at least that is what i was taught in a home break in situation i might hold someone at bay if they got into my house but its been grilled into me so hard i feel like the only time to pull out a gun and aim at someone is when you feel you need to shoot to kill to prevent harm to yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,with that hotel thing they probably would have let you in to the room since you paid for it imagine the thiefs face when he returns and finds his stolen stuff stolen
LifeProTips,not_removed,there is a gang of thugs here attacking pedestrians on the street with guns and knives wow that sucks good luck with that let us know how it goes san jose operator
LifeProTips,not_removed,i saw a grandma who ran into a fire hydrant in sunnyvale once police cars and vans showed up this was a few years ago yeaaaah nothing much happens there
LifeProTips,not_removed,hmm well for what its worth i once called in san fransisco to report a dude on the roof of my floor attic apartment and both sfpd and sffd were there in minutes it was an all night ordeal but the response time was quick
LifeProTips,not_removed,sunnyvale ca ftw
LifeProTips,not_removed,san jose isnt exactly poor palo alto is just absurdly rich as are many of the surrounding cities maybe its changed s lot in the past few years but sjpd was pretty on top of some domestic violence at my neighbors house back when i lived there
LifeProTips,not_removed,and sitting in dog slow traffic on
LifeProTips,not_removed,doubt it
LifeProTips,not_removed,mountain view and palo alto are neighboring cities we were literally three blocks from mountain view when we had our accident we probably werent far from whereever you live when it happened waitminut do you have a red truck
LifeProTips,not_removed,for future prevention even if he did something as small as place a no soliciting sign on the porch that means in the future them or anyone like them are instantly trespassing and breaking the law in most states just by pulling in the drive it protects you from trespassers like this and keeps you from seeming like an asshole by having giant no trespassing signs
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont threaten to call police or shoot them that just gives them time to get away without being arrested lock the door tell them to leave and refuse to speak get out of earshot call open safe and load pistol and wait if they try to escalate it the minute you threaten violence or their arrest youve escalated the situation which is the compete opposite of what you should do in a situation like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,help them up first then shoot them
LifeProTips,not_removed,it boils down to dead men tell no tales therefore assuming your actions were legal and justified its your word against a dead body or your word against the criminal who obviously you cant trust to be honest and was a threat and tried to break in your house and cause you harm etc etc in a court of law
LifeProTips,not_removed,im actually just squatting here after murdering the couple who owned the place they didnt really have money though so sorry wanna come in for a bit
LifeProTips,not_removed,until they say ah sweet man so are we let us in
LifeProTips,not_removed,our lives are so mundane we must fantasize were in a terrible situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,where the hell do you live where deadly force doesnt justify deadly force i need to know so i can avoid it
LifeProTips,not_removed,keep in mind that laws are different in different states and countries around the world i would take this advice with a grain of salt
LifeProTips,not_removed,who decides that to break up a fight they should hold one person down and let the other person punch them
LifeProTips,not_removed,but thats from a movie not a song
LifeProTips,not_removed,bueller
LifeProTips,not_removed,okay i laughed have an upvote
LifeProTips,not_removed,not my president
LifeProTips,not_removed,castle law hehwouldnt apply in this case if he lives in ca
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is also why you have to come across as psychotic and dangerous they would rather hit a house that doesnt have a nutjob living there you stop asking politely you start screaming your head off like a madman with no internal censor
LifeProTips,not_removed,first pulverize all his teeth burn off the fingerprints and disfigure his face this will force a dna test to establish identity if it ever comes to that which might introduce the legalforensic hurdle that saves your ass down the line an unidentifiable body can in a pinch be dressed in thrift store clothes and dropped in a bad part of town where the police are less likely to question it i dont recommend that disposal method im just saying an easily identifiable body is an even bigger threat than the opposite if youre in a house where you have some time to work get the body in the bathroom the first thing you want to do is drain it of fluids this will make it easier to cut up and slow decomposition a little bit the best way to do this quick and dirty is to perforate the body with a pointed knife and then perform cpr on it cut the fronts of the thighs deep diagonally to slit the femoral arteries then pump the chest the valves in the heart will still work when dead and the springback of the rib cage can apply a fair amount of suction to the aorta do this in the tub plug the drain and mingle lots of bleach with the bodily fluids before unplugging the drain to empty the tub this should help control the stench of death which would otherwise reek from your gutter gratings do everything you can to control odors plug in an ionizer burn candles leave bowls of baking soda everywhere ventilate the room in the middle of the night but otherwise keep it closed keep the body under a plastic sheet while its in the tub if you want to bury it i recommend separating the body into several parts and burying them separately for one thing its easier to dig a deep enough hole for a head by itself than it is for an entire body this reduces your chances of being discovered while you are actually outside and digging the grave that is the one thing you cant do inside and it represents a vulnerable moment so you want to keep it brief under hours do it between and am also its less likely for someone to call the police if their dog digs up some chunk of meat than if they dig up an entire body they may assume its an animal carcass disfigured by decomposition and leave it alone or dispose of it its also more likely that the dog will consume all of it before anyone knows the difference a whole skeleton is another story you can cut a body into pieces faster than you think its not much different than boning a chicken but it takes more work a big knife and time a hammer will be useful for pulverizing joints or driving the knife deep where it doesnt want to go anyway its wise to crush as much of the skeleton as you can along the way it will aid in making the body less identifiable for what it is as it decomposes dont return to the same site times for burialsyoull attract suspicion from anyone nearby and youll wind up placing the body parts close enough together to be found by any serious investigation put them in plastic bags with lots of bleach and store in a freezer until you have enough time to bury them all depending on what tools you have available you may find that youre get really good at deconstructing the body you might prefer to slowly sprinkle it down a drain without leaving your house this avoids the longterm risk of discovery associated with burial and the overwhelming supply of bacteria in a sewer accelerates decomposition while providing a convenient cover smell truly grinding down a body takes a lot more work and you run the risk of fouling your plumbing and calling in a plumber so dont try it unless you know how to clear bones and meat out of a drainpipe a good food processor can be useful but dont overuse it or power drills or saws theyre noisy and they attract attention and forget the kitchen sink its better to use the toilet which will give you direct access to one of the largest sewer pipes that exits your house follow any disposals with lots of bleach and then run the water for or minutes on top of that once you are finished you will need to completely clean the area and remove all traces of what happened with bleach remember blood tends to seep into all sorts of unlikely places you will want to pull the baseboards to remove any evidence of bodily fluids that has soaked into the corners also remove and replace the wax sealing ring in the base of the toilet those things act as a magnet collecting evidence of everything that you flushed down dont forget to check the ceiling blood spatter often ends up there and gets overlooked during the cleaning now comes the most important part keep your moth shut too many people are caught because they let something slip the sooner you can start thinking about what happened as nothing more than a story you once heard or a dream that you once had the better distance yourself from it and let the memory fade after all if you dont remember it did it ever really happen
LifeProTips,not_removed,put them in the bathtub and then a blender and then the sewer
LifeProTips,not_removed,also have a pit mix he has a bark bigger than he is and once he gets close you can see the need to get some pets in his face on the other hand my german shepherd does scare people so i guess ill keep them both around even though they ate my couch a few days ago d good for you though a lot of people that see a dog over a small size generally wont approach so its kind of like locking your car door itll stop the opportunist
LifeProTips,not_removed,so did the guys kill you or what
LifeProTips,not_removed,this sounds exactly like my pit bull mix his fur brother is a ballsy little chiweenie with a persistent bark who is the only thing effective at reminding him not to be timid on our walks
LifeProTips,not_removed,i took the chimes off of my doorbell its been fantastic
LifeProTips,not_removed,so the doorbell goes and you all just sit there until the person goes away what if its important what if its good news
LifeProTips,not_removed,you looked at the stars
LifeProTips,not_removed,words alone cant express how butthurt i was a few years ago when i found out that wasnt from a real movie
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre not trying hard enough with the speaker check out my new album on bandcamp low and high frequency tones to shit yourself insideout to
LifeProTips,not_removed,no no you dingus
LifeProTips,not_removed,at that point just buy a baseball bat it is the same as an unloaded gun and you dont have to lock it up also you cant have a gun on your own property in canada
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats very safe but far beyond what the law requires non restricted unloaded trigger locked or cable locked or bolt removed or locked in any locking area purpose built for gun storage restricted unloaded trigger locked or cable locked and locked in a cabinet case or difficult to break into area or locked in a gun safe or purpose builtmodified gun room ammunition stored separately and nonaccessible from the gun unless locked together in a gun safe or gun room the law does not require that it is locked and separately and nonaccessible from the gun has never been defined by law you can legally have your non restricted rifle unloaded sitting beside your front door with a trigger lock ammunition kept in the next room in a closed box and you have met the requirements of the law you can legally have a restricted handgun with no trigger lock locked in a gun safe with a loaded magazine sitting beside it and you have met the requirements of the law httpwwwrcmpgrcgccacfppcaffsfdstorageentreposageenghtm however an individual may only load a firearm or handle a loaded firearm only in a place where the firearm may be discharged in accordance with all applicable local and federal laws which means firearms are essentially impossible to be legally used for defending your home from an intruder edit for clarity and to add there is an exception if you live in an area where you require a firearm for protection even dangerous areas of the city do not meet this requirement as they have local and provincial police this is intended for people living or working where they could be harmed by wildlife ie backcountry wilderness
LifeProTips,not_removed,mental note rob homes in canada
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wouldnt say youre doing it wrong at all that sounds like a pretty responsible way to do it i will say though that sometimes it can be important for a farmer to have a loaded easily accessible shotgun or rifle depending on what in particular youre farming for instance my friends family growing up had quite a few cows when a cow would give birth i know for a fact that there was a loaded rifle or shotgun somewhere pretty much all the time for the first few months afterwards because it was very common for the coyotes to come out of the woods towards the evening and try to drag the calf off if you can just grab a long gun and flashlight slip your shoes on and be out the door youve got a better chance at preventing the calf from being killed
LifeProTips,not_removed,does it change that particular case was his conviction overturned
LifeProTips,not_removed,when seconds matter the police are only minutes away
LifeProTips,not_removed,next time you say youre going to shoot through the door and hang up
LifeProTips,not_removed,dispatch tells my wife that were being overly concerned since we have a deadbolt on the apartment door thats crazy
LifeProTips,not_removed,why would you heres a lpt the police arent there to protect you no reallythe supreme court ruled and everything they are the investigative and enforcement arm of the state period any protection you get is them going above and beyond the call of duty to be fairmany good cops do but never count on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,three weeks ago we had a new dispatcher i guess this was her first night on planet earth so my neighbors are having a domestic and the girls husband is getting all loud and violent so she calls the police im sorry no ones on duty right now the fuck does this mean we should rob the bank can i go kill that prick jefferson anyway turns out she should have dispatched a county car or state trooper if she had to she litterally just told our neighbor that no one was there and there was nothing she could do to help shits crazy
LifeProTips,not_removed,best case minutes which is still a long time more realistic is damn what fantasy city do you live in i called the police when someone was trying to break into my back yard presumably to steal the copper from my ac unit and it took them nearly minutes to show up someone wouldve had enough time to break in kill me make themselves a sandwich take a long dump and a quick nap before the police even started in my direction
LifeProTips,not_removed,i missed a reference didnt i my bad never actually seen that no
LifeProTips,not_removed,im assuming the dog was either chained or fenced in the yard you might be right if it was a free range dog otherwise its fucked if they decide they want it fucked
LifeProTips,not_removed,dog is probably on a leash
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had dogs attack me on multiple occasions while i was unarmed a pair of them at one point even honestly they kind of suck at violence
LifeProTips,not_removed,if someone killed my dog
LifeProTips,not_removed,the homeowners life outweighs the dogs the dogs life outweighs the trespassers once theyve decided not to take no for an answer
LifeProTips,not_removed,according to the criminal code of canada its legal to carry a product designed for personal protection against another human however mace – which has a higher concentration of oleoresin capsicum the chemical found in pepper spray – is considered a prohibited weapon which makes it illegal from what i read its just deemed too violent and they dont want to deal with it however you are legally allowed to have a weapon on you for self defense ie all my friends carry knives just encase and most people i know keep a large bathockey stick just inside the door to bash heads with also bear spraywasp spraydog spray are all legal to defend yourself with and bear spray is actually worse the only thing is if your caught carrying it around for no reason you can get fined
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive heard the same better range and typically made to be nice aimable stream not something anyone wants inonaround their facial region
LifeProTips,not_removed,west virginia
LifeProTips,not_removed,georgetown
LifeProTips,not_removed,does utah have hella meth labs that im not aware of
LifeProTips,not_removed,well thanks for saying so sorry if i came off as abrasive its just scary how many people think they are entitled to brandish a firearm at will i think your move is the right one mostly i wouldnt unholster my gun or rack it it will take time for someone to break that barrier into my house and frankly i dont want a criminal to know i have a gun the less information he has about my capabilities the better the less prepared he is for whats to come however im of the understanding that there is a tiny chance this will ever even happen
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait so you unholster a weapon make it ready to fire and literally say to the people that you will kill them if they enter before calling the police i dont know i wouldve probably done the exact opposite tell them to piss off if they dont call the police tell the people that i am armed and then unholster the weapon
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah but i didnt have an id and he could have you know killed me interestingly the hotel lady explained it to where it sounded like the guy had a hooker soooo i guess i paid for that
LifeProTips,not_removed,win for my team old mrs johnson died but took with her while dual wielding aks pretty ballz if you ask me you should have come down
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was also once hit by an obvious drunk driver who tried to do a hit and run a cop happened to be driving right then by some miracle after the cop talked to the other driver for a short while he came to me and said he was gonna send us both on our way and let insurance handle it the other driver was so close to getting off free until she started puking out her window after some more investigating the cop found out the girl was not old enough to even have a license and was black out drunk paramedics had to be called because the girl was puking so much can not believe the cop was about to let her go
LifeProTips,not_removed,the no soliciting sign would have to be visible before pulling into the driveway if you have it on the porch and its not visible then sign wont matter
LifeProTips,not_removed,why not call an ambulance wait for them to heal go to court then you shoot them the judge would know how you only shot to defend but kills the guy instead hes dead so theres no witnesses and you get off scotfree
LifeProTips,not_removed,donald trump
LifeProTips,not_removed,threes company bitch
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes definitely i always find it beneficial to search a law to see if its actually accurate first of all let alone if its only relative to one state or one country ill never forget when a bunch of my kids in my school year heard about the minute rule where if teachers are more than minutes late the class is therefore cancelled it turns out it was only in the us and i believe only in select states i remember it was the last lesson of the day and about people left the class after minutes and went home they all got punished for bunking the lessonall because they just believed what they read ever since then i always double check

LifeProTips,not_removed,anything important or good would have been communicated another way email phone call etc what good important thing would require someone to show up at your door with no notice the only three things i have ever had show up at my doorstep unannounced are the mail salesmen and religious nuts trying to convert me the mail will get left on my porch and the other two i dont want to speak to so i just never answer the door edit a whole bunch of people are trying to be contrarian and post things that try to prove me wrong neighbors no they can call me and do also notice my post said unannounced police no shit obviously i would answer the door if someone announced they were police and were wearing a police uniform free stuff not interested lump in with salesmen i dont believe you just go around handing people free things and dont try to sign them up for some shit usps mail being forwarded to ups doesnt happen seriously like im going to believe that usps is just going to ship your mail to ups if you dont answer the door lol thats one of the most desperate youre wrong posts ive ever seen in my life
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is what i do go to a window out of the direct vision of person slowly part blinds always have them closed if youre a privacy fanatic like me and look at target almost always walk away and have a happier day than if you were to open the door
LifeProTips,not_removed,if its important theyll leave a note or call if not then it was probably a knife salesman or a local politician
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dunno almost anyone who could have good news for me would have my phone number the only people we open the door for are neighbors and handymen and even the neighbors we sometimes ignore
LifeProTips,not_removed,you found the brown note huh
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can have a firearm on your own property but our storage laws are stricter for non restricted firearms most shotguns and rifles either locked in a safecase or trigger lock chain lock etc and ammo locked up somewhere else for displaying a firearm locked in safe or case and trigger lock chain etc this allows ammo to be stored in the same locked case for restricted firearms handguns scary shotguns and rifles trigger lock and safecase for display the case must be unable to move and ammo locked away somewhere else pretty much for an average canadian to use a firearm for home defense they would have to go get their firearm from their safe remove trigger lock unlock ammunition and load the firearm before they could do anything source httpwwwrcmpgrcgccacfppcaffsfdstorageentreposageenghtm
LifeProTips,not_removed,i once called the police while a family member was getting beaten at a place about a thirty second drive from the police station they ended up running to the car i hit the gas and we waited in the front of the apartment complex for about twenty minutes gg cops
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just listened to a podcast revealepisode alawless lands where this is a reality in oregon its scary think that you cant get help when you need it they are so broke in this particular oregon county that if you get caught stealing a car or something they arrest them then take them to the jail and give them a citation and let them go on their merry way
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats insane ive had some unhelpful dispatchers too just another reason to own a firearm god forbid you ever have to use it but
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive lived all over but i said best case for a reason most cops are good people there just arent enough of them
LifeProTips,not_removed,you still made a solid point
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha thats ok i recommend watching it though its pretty good
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpwwwkieggscomaucontentdogsmaremmaguardinghensjpg never heard an off lead dog called free range only heard that for street dogs
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive had dogs my entire life but dont think for a second about putting your life above your pets its a good way to get you both injuredkilled this goes for humans in dire situations aswell and is the first thing they teach you not to do in an emergency more people get themselves hurt trying to save others when there is a chance of survival for said party if i can save my dog without getting myself or others injured i will but the alternative could be much worse dogs are pretty resilient unless they straight murder it id have enough time to arm myself or get on the phone with
LifeProTips,not_removed,too violent sheesh youre defending yourself against bodily harm in such situations no amount of violence is excessive if someone is attacking me my right to avoid being beaten or worse supercedes their right to live not all human life is sacrosanct on another note this is why gun control has such trouble gaining a foothold in the us its all well and good to prevent people from attacking others with a firearm but some also want to prevent people from defending themselves with a firearm and that wont fly at all

LifeProTips,not_removed,jesus what a civil and respectful exchange quite a refreshing sight
LifeProTips,not_removed,civil discussion on reddit its like a double rainbow thank you both
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guarantee you thats how most people in this thread would proceed even if they say otherwise any responsible gun owner knows about escalation of force and would shut the door to defuseend the situation before resorting to violence
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you tell them about the gun and your willingness to use it the more likely the police are going to arrive at a scene where the criminal never even attempted to force the door but left rather than get shot
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah at some point its better for your health to just do a charge back and buy a new wallet
LifeProTips,not_removed,what kind of hooker takes credit cards
LifeProTips,not_removed,obviously drunk driver missed our car by inches then demolished two other cars before careening into dirt on the road shoulder and digging a ditch this was outside a doctor office and the doctor ran out to find me pulling this asshole from his car before it could explode doctor announces to police that the driver reeks of whiskey police let him go free he was a retired police officer
LifeProTips,not_removed,well once they walk up to the porch and see the sign dont they have to immediately turn around and walk back to their car

LifeProTips,not_removed,who is pepe silvia
LifeProTips,not_removed,chik chickachickhhhhhaaaaaa
LifeProTips,not_removed,day bow bow charlie kelly
LifeProTips,not_removed,to be fair there are a lot of reasons for that besides this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am not a lawyer but did do some research on cas use of force laws when i was thinking of moving there a few years back no castle law in ca but unless use of force laws changed there someone in your home who is both trespassing and had to break and enter to get there is legally presumed to be presenting a threat to your life i dont remember their stance on duty to retreat in those cases that btw is all castle and stand your ground laws ever cover they eliminate duty to retreat they are not a carte blanche license to kill and it isnt enough to merely feel threatened the standard for use of lethal force is generally that any reasonable person in your position would have perceived that the assailant had ability opportunity and intent to kill or permanently injure you and that the use of force would mitigate this threat the difference in states without stand your ground is that you also have to prove you couldnt run away castle doctrine means you dont have to prove you could get away but only in your home i understand that reasonable people can disagree on these laws but it annoys me to no end when the basis for debate is misrepresentation of what a law says am not lawyer dont take my word for this but definitely look up the law this was all spelled out pretty clearly ca makes armed self defense outside your home pretty much impossible but inside your home its still feasible or at least was years or so ago of course you shouldnt take the laws word for it either talk to an attorney whoo specializes in this area if youve seriously decided to make lethal force an option for yourself case law can bend the language of the actual law to mean some very surprising things also law enforcement officers are not attorneys a police officer can be a good honest person and can often have a good command of the law as it relates to hisher job but the nuances of the behavior you need to avoid a homicide charge for defending yourself are outside their area of expertise
LifeProTips,not_removed,krieg
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel like if i did this i would have a fist in my face pretty quickly
LifeProTips,not_removed,reminds me of things the psychos in borderlands would say

LifeProTips,not_removed,plastic barrel buried in the desert next to the barrel of money surprise the fuck out of someone who opens the wrong barrel
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is why you use lye not hydrofluoric acid which is not only much fuckin easier to get your hands on but wont eat through enamel
LifeProTips,not_removed,no acid eats through enameled iron old fashioned bathtubs very few bathtubs are ceramic ie porcelain tiles etc the other problem is that whatever the tub most modern ones are plastic the drain for sure is not and the acid will eat the drain connection if nothing else still nothing beats a big splat when tub ceiling and partially dissolved body lands on floor below
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh moss
LifeProTips,not_removed,fact
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just look through the front window fuck em if they see me in here im still not answering listen to my collective pounds of dog bark and decide if you want to press the issue
LifeProTips,not_removed,the trick is people are all different sizes and different sizes coupled with different gut capacities and indeed contents mean different resonant frequencies so youve got to kind of sweep around the region until you get it
LifeProTips,not_removed,serious question if you ever had to use those guns how does that work do you tell a potential intruder to give you a few moments while you unlock your guns and ammo and load them
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks i probably will actually ive heard good things about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,take me home
LifeProTips,not_removed,jarbidge

LifeProTips,not_removed,like for instance you require water to live
LifeProTips,not_removed,few counter points castle doctrine means you dont have to prove you could get away but only in your home not true in many states many states castle doctrine applies to any location you have a legal right to be and the ones that dont frequently extend it to your vehicle mind you if its the former its typically referred to as stand your ground the standard for use of lethal force is generally that any reasonable person in your position would have perceived that the assailant had ability opportunity and intent to kill or permanently injure you and that the use of force would mitigate this threat its actually not permanently injure you its typically the lower standard of grievous injury for example beating you to a pulp isnt necessarily permanent but it can be grievous no castle law in ca california has a stand your ground doctrine removing your duty to retreat from any place you have a right to be including your home that btw is all castle and stand your ground laws ever cover stand your ground covers duty to retreat castle doctrine typically covers multiple items first and foremost is often but not always provides civil immunity in a clean shooting in your home it states that a person breaking and entering an occupied home is presumed to intend bodily harm or death to the occupants this means you dont need to actually see the weapon or hear them state im going to kill you for it to be a clean self defense case if they have broken into your home while youre inside in some again not all states it extends the use of deadly force to cover property crimes such as arson or burglary of an occupied home

LifeProTips,not_removed,squarewaves might work but will be pretty brutal for your loudspeaker you need a hell of a lot of sound pressure and for that youre really going to want something hornloaded and large you probably cant really make people shit themselves but you can make them feel incredibly ill with infrasonics
LifeProTips,not_removed,no jokes when i got my firearms and hunting license i asked the instructor about using either my rifle or bow to defend myself or my dog the situation was that our house backed onto a forest and coyotes would prowl around our backyard on more then one occasion my dog became aware of them before i could see them and wanted to go after them knowing i wouldnt be allowed to use my rifle so close to the house i asked if my bow was ok to use to take down a coyote and prevent an attack of myself my wife or my dog apparently my town has banned the discharge of any weapons including bows and my instructor informed me that if any of my neigbours called the cops i would be charged i asked what options i had and was told bluntly that you better bring a big knife out with you i did for the rest of my time living there and never had to use it but it was crazy infuriating that i couldnt even protect my wife or pup from a wild animal with anything other then my bare hands or a knife
LifeProTips,not_removed,charlie not only do all of these people exist but they have been asking for their mail on a daily basis

LifeProTips,not_removed,from a health center pharmacy billing perspective im curious about the coinsurance inner workings and payment processing
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont pay for medicine swedish citizen
LifeProTips,not_removed,pharm tech here these types of discounts can only be used with commercial plans you are ineligible for manufacturer copay assistance if youre using medicare or medicaid also read the fine print many copay cards have asterisks and phrasing like as low as sometimes they will only cover up to x per month or y lifetime if your copay is more than x youll have to pay even worse is when the coupons have limited number of uses per year or per lifetime and youre halfway through a course of treatment only to find out you cant afford to continue when i worked in retail pharmacy ive been yelled at for all of the above your pharmacy doesnt make the coupons the drug company does read the coupon
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use a condomhelps prevent hiv infection
LifeProTips,not_removed,its called coordination of benefits you process through the primary payer typically workplace insurance the software then passes that paid claim through the secondary which is the coupon or more accurately whoever the benefits manager is for the coupon in most cases this is all done electronically and more or less instantly sometimes the claim wont process and you have to submit it manually
LifeProTips,not_removed,the real lpt is always in the comments
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think ive ever had an enjoyable text conversation
LifeProTips,not_removed,no terrible etiquette thats what phone conversations are for texting is up for adjustment at anytime and understanding how the other person typically responds you should essentially treat it as an email
LifeProTips,not_removed,to each their own i just know some people prefer it over phone conversations
LifeProTips,not_removed,do you actually enjoy phone conversations i find im unable to focus on a conversation i cant see so i keep getting distracted on the phone youve got of my attention for a long time for texts youve got of my attention in seconds at a time
LifeProTips,not_removed,true yet i know people who get upset when it shows someone read their text message and didnt respond until hours later i swear this generation is soft as fuck
LifeProTips,not_removed,how is it terrible etiquette i should clarify dont respond if you know you cant commit unless its obviously an emergency or someone needs an answer to a quick question im referring mainly to people who respond to someone who wants to have a conversation but then leaves them hanging midway or something and not everyone enjoys talking over the phone
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre over right your age is showing
LifeProTips,not_removed,i can agree to this as well when talking to my circle of friends sometimes our conversations can derail into some pretty hilarious and inappropriate topics that we wouldnt dare say out loud text provides a fast discreet and convenient method of communication
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok
LifeProTips,not_removed,touche
LifeProTips,not_removed,implication i think is that youre mature to understand the usage of text and that it doesnt replace a phone call for a continuous stream of conversation anyone that treats texting as if it was a phone call expecting devoted attention and prompt responses are young and arrogant
LifeProTips,not_removed,solid consistent routine helpsstretchyogateawhatever winds you down same time helps as well but that can be tricky lavender essential oil on the pilloweye maskcalea zacatechichi golden milk with tumeric if you want the advanced tips check out wwwredditcomrluciddreaming
LifeProTips,not_removed,some people say when you feel like you dont dream or cant remember them its because your brain releases too much dmt and automatically blocks out memory
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel like a lighter room stimulates the brain into dreaming my family always says that you dream more on a full moon and personally i reckon this is true but is probably due to the increased light in the room make sure you can actually sleep as well also make sure that you arent too tired and are going to bed early if you are exhaustedlate sleep you will just rush through it in blackness
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel i dream a lot more when my kitty wakes me up three hours before my alarm i get up and give her food then go back to bed dream
LifeProTips,not_removed,do you smoke a lot of weed it can make you not dream lol like i had a friend who smoked weed everyday and he didnt dream for months if you do then maybe try to not go to bed high
LifeProTips,not_removed,apple juice induces very vivid dreams try drinking glasses before going to bed
LifeProTips,not_removed,sleep in on a weekend oversleep undersleep change up your sleep cycle set strange alarms to mess with your sleep cycle i dont think remembering your dreams is necessarily a good thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,seriously thats amazing im going to look into that because sometimes i go a month or two without dreaming or atleast without remembering dreams and i feel like that makes me feel less rested something something rem sleep
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol not sure if youre kidding or not
LifeProTips,not_removed,in general feed your gut microbiome eat resistant starches in the evening stuff like potatoes or rice or pasta when refridgerated a couple of hours after cooking are rich in resistant starch gets destroyed by reheating though so eat cold or warm it up very gently or take a tablespoon of raw potato starch or inulin with a glass of water before going to bed
LifeProTips,not_removed,might be the looked down upon method but take a xanax or ambien prior to your flight alternatively having a drink before boarding and inflight may help
LifeProTips,not_removed,if it is safety that gets you then go here an realize how many flights there are at any one time and how infrequently you ever hear about air catastrophes i live in hong kong and have hour flights to pass the time i watch a lot of movies
LifeProTips,not_removed,would breaking it in to two flights be more comfortable
LifeProTips,not_removed,read a book or watch movies during the flight
LifeProTips,not_removed,for the weeks before have a checklist with planned dates then stick to it for the honeymoon flight i really hope your mood and partner will be good enough that you manage for the bachelor party flight well thats harder i dont get stressed in planes and im also able to sleep on command so i wouldnt know how to deal with it sorry btw congratulations
LifeProTips,not_removed,take dramamine it will knock you out so youll sleep on the plane and youll be less likely to get motion sickness
LifeProTips,not_removed,quality pair of noise cancelling headphones your preferred form of entertainment do some research about your destinations and get excited making plans about the things you want to do and see this will give you something to focus on drugs if you need them also get your partner to choose you a new aftershave scent for your wedding and wear it right through your honeymoon then wear it only for anniversaries and special occasions smell association is an amazing thing it may also help in the future if you have to fly reminding you that planes arent all bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,i fly often and the longer flights over hours i get semianxious about i would suggest trying to avoid taking medication andor drinking so a few things i like to do try to confirm an aisle seat so i can get up and go to the bathroom stretch my legs as easily as possible download a few movies a sweatersweatshirt get a book earplugs headphones external battery all for my carryon get my favorite snacksfoods remember the liquids rule rather than buying at the airport or on the plane get to the airport early
LifeProTips,not_removed,and here i am itching to jump out of a plane
LifeProTips,not_removed,mini booze bottles
LifeProTips,not_removed,just accept it i chose to take this risk if it goes down that sucks but it will sure be a rush plus you could become a survivor of a plane crash and that would be a pretty cool story and youll get free flights for the rest of your life so you can risk it again
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always have a couple drinks
LifeProTips,not_removed,then youd have two take offs and landings
LifeProTips,not_removed,really shouldnt be too hard i cant speak from experience but i know a few people have just told their doc they have flight anxiety and just need a small scrip
LifeProTips,not_removed,you just have to keep in mind that youre just along for the ride regardless of what happens ive learned to embrace the powerlessness of all of it
LifeProTips,not_removed,all you need is two years and a half of sleep debt i always have some sleep to catch up with so anytime i need i sleep also ten years of practice sleeping in class at college and during flexible schedule jobs that helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,also bring it back with the same amount if not more gas than you recieved it

LifeProTips,not_removed,i see you also have friends or relatives who meant to stop at the gas station and return your car with barely enough gas to make it the blocks to the nearest one the fuel light on the dashboard doesnt mean keep driving around the city for another hours
LifeProTips,not_removed,because even though they piss me off sometimes they usually make up for it by dealing with my shit it all evens out eventually
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is great advice also works if something you own breaks like your phone and you need to furnish a serial number for warranty or returns but you no longer have physical evidence the serial
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont have a serial number i have a genome
LifeProTips,not_removed,i do agree with this but i instead use pictures ill take a picture with a phone or digital camera of everything i have relatively valuable and then a picture of either the serial electronics and things with serials or the receipt of purchase ill then upload it to an internet based storage that cant be taken by fire this actually helped me massively when my apartment complex burned down during a drought in boise idaho in the summer after someone decided bbqing with a charcoal grill out in a field with tall dry grass was a good idea while inebriated and was able to get back more than what i lost in insurance money as a result because some of the things i didnt even actually own any more and there was no way to prove it as my apartment was completely destroyed was still a hassle replacing everything and being homeless however so i wouldnt recommend
LifeProTips,not_removed,came in to say mine is agent but then read the rest of it and im totally convinced
LifeProTips,not_removed,this advice is good but not for law enforcement this is information you want to have on your houserenters insurance because thats who would need it to substantiate a claim
LifeProTips,not_removed,they cant find the shit either way
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt you may not want to casually admit insurance fraud
LifeProTips,not_removed,we do retrieve belongings much more so if we have a serial number
LifeProTips,not_removed,this police never do shit for stolen things
LifeProTips,not_removed,this ಠಠ
LifeProTips,not_removed,anonymous forum i can admit pretty much anything
LifeProTips,not_removed,ugh that was not okay of the top level commenter
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait why would the person on the bottom have to crouch generally
LifeProTips,not_removed,he doesnt
LifeProTips,not_removed,it was quite confusing but never mind that i got a nice tip for ya if its heavy and you need to cover a long distance over flat ground not upstairs or something you can teach it to walk pavel pavel seriously his name is pavel pavel moved moa statues like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,make a angled cover for the fan out of card have it direct the airflow downwards towards the floor place something black below it on the floor to stop light reflecting to the ceiling
LifeProTips,not_removed,get one of those eyecover things they hand out on planes
LifeProTips,not_removed,make yourself a box like this and since its just a box fan and not an ac unit you can probably make it out of cardboard and duct tapeand what the hay duct tape it to the fan
LifeProTips,not_removed,you could just get an eye mask for sleeping
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can get like an extra sheet or curtain and wrap it around the fan with maybe safety pins or something so it creates like a wind sock that lets air in but through a tunneltube to stop lightor you can also just get much longer curtain to go over the fan
LifeProTips,not_removed,an aluminum emergency blanket a few bucks at any campingoutdoor supply place is thin silver film that like tinted windows cuts down a lot of light and works like a oneway mirror if youre applying the film from the inside of the window you can try tapingfastening the edges of the blanket around where the light comes in the most or even over the entire window frame as the blankets are about x
LifeProTips,not_removed,you could change that out for a ducted fan type setup or maybe build a duct around the exisiting fan and aim the air and light at a less intrusive angle
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am dislexic this may need an interpreter i would use a cardboard box thing like make a whole window size box with no upper side it could be placed during sleep and not otherwise the advantages of keeping box sides is the cardboard wont be against anything or even touching the curtains or vent air can circulate i would leave the box side at the top open if you fix it right you can fold your box away under your mattress when not sleeping i would not put the box covering the vents seen under window i m not sure what it will do to airflow to have the vents having a box above them youll have to see where it goes after but basically you need that air you need nothing to catch fire and it all needs to work it appears form the picture that box could be affixed with a old mens tie or something something broad so wont tangle in threaded through slots the middle of the box bottom and curtain rod and tied on the inside the room side or you can put a flap in the box and just brace the sides of box in with an adjustable rod you know the ones that spring out so you dont need to worry that are sometimes seen in loos with some feet you can make your own pretty easy if you have no duct tape to make a big box you could probably just make tab and slots and construct it without tape old election posters might be cool material hey look i know find an engineering student at your school and ask them
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work the shift as a nurse ive done some crazy shit to keep the light out of my bedroom i actually went as far as duct taping black foam board on all of my bedroom windows and then putting black out curtains over the top of the foam board my suggestion to you is to remove the fan from the window all together get at least two more fans so you have three and sleep with them pointed at you itll cool you off enough to get to sleep and then you dont have to worry about it always remember when on night shift sleep comes first before anything else if i was promised a decent days sleep id sleep on satans asshole
LifeProTips,not_removed,went to a craft store bought two lengths of black felt and two sets of sticky backed velcro stuck the velcro around my windows sized the felt and added the other half of the velcro to it blacks out all light especially when paired with light cancelling curtains
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant tell exactly whats happening in the photo but i can tell you what worked for me as a starving college student working hour nights and who likes to sleep a lot it sounds cheesy i know but i taped aluminum foil to my windows it blocks out light incredibly and if you secure the corners it doesnt make noise it was sort of the cheap mans version of thermal curtains hope this helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,buy one of those eye cover thingys
LifeProTips,not_removed,get thermal curtains and put something in front of that window fan that obstructs the light going to the bed but not the airflow best alternative is to get those sleeping eye travel patches
LifeProTips,not_removed,wear a blindfold if you do not want to figure out where to get a blindfold drape a shirt over your head so that the neckline rests beneath your eyes and above your nose
LifeProTips,not_removed,you need a curtain around your bed
LifeProTips,not_removed,duck tape the gaps of light
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a great idea to compound on the suggestion uiilobsterii gave theres still some hope that i wont turn into a sleepdepraved mindless zombie by the end of summer
LifeProTips,not_removed,while that is a great idea that i have embarrassingly not thought of myself it unfortunately hasnt worked well for me in the past i am the kind of light sleeper who cant fall asleep if anything directly disrupts my usual sleep pattern such as the absence of white noise or even wearing a tshirt
LifeProTips,not_removed,this could actually work nicely try putting black paperblack trash bagsblack duct tape on the inside lining to darken the light as well also for clarity the drawing on the right is a section cut view of the long side
LifeProTips,not_removed,people have been throwing out cardboard boxes from their new mini fridges so this may be a temporary fix until i find a solution to make the room as dark as possible thank you ill give it a shot
LifeProTips,not_removed,no need for an interpreter thank you for your suggestion and taking the time for such a thoughtful answer i have to say it is quite funny that you suggest i go see an engineering student as i am studying for my bachelors in engineering and am in my third year lol no hard feelings i can just be brain dead when i am sleepdepraved time to get out my graph paper and engineer the s out of this
LifeProTips,not_removed,thermal curtains is a neat idea to keep the room cooler but i am living in a dorm room over the summer and have no authorization to do so
LifeProTips,not_removed,what i use to do was similar i pinned a blanket between the window and the fan to drape over it that way air was always circulating in but the sheet blocked most of the light it was a super high thread count btw
LifeProTips,not_removed,worth a try in studentspeak i doubt they cost more than noodlecups
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cam back to say i thought about it and it makes sense you are an engineer you described the issue well took a photo and began researching solutions before asking i would of tried everything i could think of and found out to use a blindfold only after experiencing minor dyi injuries a budget blow out several tantrums and a crisis of faith i made you a picture of what happens if you ask the wrong speciality of engineer to tackle a busted tollgate problem problem alun bestor texture on road
LifeProTips,not_removed,yay you can mcgyver this
LifeProTips,not_removed,nothing is stopping you from hanging thermal curtains as long as you dont to any damage to the wall such as hanging them using the existing curtain rods
LifeProTips,not_removed,alright ill give it a shot right after i make tonights much anticipated dinner on a students budget noodlecups
LifeProTips,not_removed,the current curtains are mounted on a rail instead of a rod and the only way to remove them is by dismantling both curtain and rail id rather not mess around with it since i already owe this school enough money through student loans haha
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can even use the sleeve of a dark sweater thats what i do
LifeProTips,not_removed,great idea too bad i dont own any xxxxxxxxl sweaters whose sleeve would cover a box fan i only joke ill probably just throw the whole sweater over it and let the air escape through the hoodie or something being an engineering student it is my duty to test the validity of each suggestion
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant tell if youre joking or not i meant use the sleeve as a blindfoldeye mask
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant sleep with natural or unnatural light either and never could get the hang of a sleep mask but something light weight like a tshirt or bandana draped across my eyes works i also find that completely covering your head and opening my eyes before going to sleep helps too by imprinting blackness into my visual cortex otherwise i have a perception that its still too bright
LifeProTips,not_removed,not sure how great of an idea this is but i once bought some velcro from michaels to hold a cushion on a stool ive never tried to remove the pieces though so i dont know if it leaves a sticky residue if you ever wanted to remove them but it holds the cushion on nicely
LifeProTips,not_removed,wont really help with the couch but bondage straps can help if your mattress does this too
LifeProTips,not_removed,i never thought of velcro to be honest maybe an extra large patch would do the trickill look into that thanks for the idea
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds kinky
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah they actually sell varying widths so perhaps theyd have one big enough glad to be of help hope it works out
LifeProTips,not_removed,it does but the straps are actually on backwards so theyre unusable for anything else
LifeProTips,not_removed,valar dogaeris in response to your username hehe
LifeProTips,not_removed,hahaha i love it upvotes to you sir gatsby
LifeProTips,not_removed,waiting for videos to buffer in
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont know anyone who has gotten in shape or improved their health by flailing around as skyrim ep loaded
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i wanted to exercise i wouldnt be sitting on my ass browsing reddit watching stupid videos
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow its a brilliant idea i will start soon
LifeProTips,not_removed,number of obese australians drastically decreases
LifeProTips,not_removed,what does buffering even mean wait oh no i didnt have to
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am guessing op is australian zing
LifeProTips,not_removed,i will get a good half second workout per video it all adds up
LifeProTips,not_removed,can you please explain a bit more are you anxious around the person anxiety about what they think about you if the relationship will work out if you like the person

LifeProTips,not_removed,be careful with inkjet photos or other types which may stick to other photos
LifeProTips,not_removed,so thats why i saw people being turned away told theyd have to get on a later one when the bus was full yet they had a valid ticket
LifeProTips,not_removed,works for airlines too
LifeProTips,not_removed,only poor people take the bus
LifeProTips,not_removed,it depends on the airline in the us i dont think it would work for any airline except southwest the others would probably make you pay for a sameday change unless you have elite status
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think bill gates is going to be taking the bus but many average to upper middle class income take the bus in my area perhaps it depends where you are
LifeProTips,not_removed,and giants need legroom
LifeProTips,not_removed,it works but do it at the gate if i want to catch an earlier flight than i booked ill just show up and ask works really well for early morning flights which a lot of people miss from the airlines perspective they might be overbooked on the later flight you heading out early saves them some
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am always congenial with the gate agents i make them smile and have never been denied a free rebooking to an earlier flight if space was available well there was the gay gate agent cussing out and spitting at customers he got canned right in front of us and escorted out by security whining all the while not a pretty sight i decided to wait for my ticketed flight on that day
LifeProTips,not_removed,it heavily depends on the area where i live theres something like bus route idek because literally no one uses it most people just use uber the only bus people actually use are the kids and school busses for obvious reasons
LifeProTips,not_removed,hes trying to feel like hes better than everybody else
LifeProTips,not_removed,it works but do it at the gate if i want to catch an earlier flight than i booked ill just show up and ask works really well for early morning flights which a lot of people miss from the airlines perspective they might be overbooked on the later flight you heading out early saves them some how recently have you done this i know it used to work well around years ago but i havent heard of it working much anymore are you at a small airport
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow thats crazy how did you know he was gay what was he angry about
LifeProTips,not_removed,im guessing you live in a rural or suburban area its more common in big cities in the bay area many of the top computer engineers in silicon valley take bart or the bus to work
LifeProTips,not_removed,he only travels by space shuttle or not at all filthy casuals take the bus
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive done it in the past years do it at the gate its not a guarantee but its worth a shot
LifeProTips,not_removed,somebody downvoted my post because i mentioned the guys sexual preference lol his behavior and demeanor were quite obviously homosexual to all present no question
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeap suburban area
LifeProTips,not_removed,look at those space shuttle travelers who cant afford to go by dimensional vortex
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive done it in the past years do it at the gate its not a guarantee but its worth a shot may i ask which airline and what is your success rate
LifeProTips,not_removed,his behavior and demeanor were quite obviously homosexual to all present no question how is it possible to determine someones sexuality through their behavior and demeanor there are certain stereotypical behaviors that homosexual people often have but those are just that stereotypes there are plenty of flamboyant guys out there who act gay but really arent
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are looking to be convinced of what demonstrates homosexual behavior i cannot help you
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are looking to be convinced of what demonstrates homosexual behavior i cannot help you of course you cant because there is no such thing as demonstrating homosexual behavior you can use all the stereotypes in the world but they arent going to be accurate
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,you didnt a bmw wow i dont know what to say i can always count on you for the best gifts dont tell me what colour i want to be surprised
LifeProTips,not_removed,id get them a miniature bmw car to out smart ass them
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is the advantage here i dont really see the benefit if youre doing all your bankingemergency fund from checking accounts you are losing out on premium credit card rewards and interest
LifeProTips,not_removed,i keep way more than here in europe you pay fees if one account has more than bucks on average of deposit so i simply fill up one and move onto the next basically every online bank account is free nowadays
LifeProTips,not_removed,im browsing subs to join work is slow and this one really nailed it makes scence and is very practice plus with the ease of moblie apps for banking you can control a lot of the in between nice post
LifeProTips,not_removed,your question is geared towards someone who has decent credit and doesnt have any issues budgeting my tip is geared towards people who have debt cant or wont use credit and need help keeping themselves on budget edit also your wallet was just stolen and all your cards are gone glad you got that backup checking account card at home
LifeProTips,not_removed,it would appear op works at a bank and is trying to drum up sales lpt get a savings account in case your cat ever gets sick
LifeProTips,not_removed,is it you dont have to be great at budgeting to realize a savings account is better than a checking account for emergency funds
LifeProTips,not_removed,vinegar is amazing acetic acid really have underarm odor that deodorant cant fix use applecider vinegar and wash your arm pits for four days with it kills the microbes that cause odor
LifeProTips,not_removed,guess whos buying white vinegar tomorrow this bitch is
LifeProTips,not_removed,also works to get cigarette smoke out
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait so no detergent just pour vinegar into the tray or on clothes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hear its good for your lettuce diet
LifeProTips,not_removed,pour in with detergent when water level floods the clothes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think bringing a water bottle to the presentation helps it allows you to pace yourself with periodic sips of water and can be a lifesaver when you freeze up or forgot what you were going to say itll also prevent your mouth from drying out from nervousness or anxiety during the presentation
LifeProTips,not_removed,do more presentations even if you have to wrangle friends and family in to watching some simulated practice sessions once you do it a lot youll become more comfortable and the issues will go away
LifeProTips,not_removed,i read a lpt once that was about how not to get upset during an argument pretend your a fictional character the example was darth vader darth vader doesnt get all choked up and cry or soppy when in an argument he stands clear and composed imagine yourself as vader be vader in this case you could be standing at the front of the room presenting and pretending to be darth vader or any other strong fictional character that you admire and you can even pretend to do the raspy breathing sounds of lord vader when you breathe in or out very subtly so only you notice but it might help put you in character more to destroy that presentation like it was rebellion scum
LifeProTips,not_removed,stage fright isnt something you can talk yourself out of its a fightorflight response you may know youre just standing in front of classmates or coworkers but your body thinks its a pack of wild animals waiting for a reason to eat you the only real solution is to give more presentations and adapt to the stress until it no longer affects you so much but if you dont have that kind of time and just want some tips on getting through one presentation i would suggest focusing on your breathing in the moments leading up to it take long slow deep breaths and focusing on speaking as slowly as you can during the presentation nobody goes too slowly because of nerves only too fast
LifeProTips,not_removed,hello ubigwavesmallocean unfortunately your submission has been removed for breaking the following subreddit rules not a lifeprotip if you have any questions please httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetolifeprotips
LifeProTips,not_removed,there is a difference between me calling myself a dumbass and you calling me a dumbass
LifeProTips,not_removed,man i remember when my self esteem was so low that i used to do this i mean i still do but i did before too
LifeProTips,not_removed,self deprecating humor is the best kind to me they always make me laugh my ass off eg louis ck conan o brien certain memes too bad im terrible at them it really takes skill to pull it off well hats off to those kinds of comedians
LifeProTips,not_removed,or they are trying to shield other people or make them more confident about themselves by showing they are not perfect
LifeProTips,not_removed,or they might just be british i always have to tone down the selfdeprecation when talking to americans they seem to interpret it very differently to how we do
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is actually how you know a person is a lowkey dick they assume they have permission to make fun of you freely by making fun of yourself and theyll instantly jump on the chance to let go of their inhibitions
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh god i have never read such an accurate summary of why i do this thank you might go cry now but thank you anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am self deprecating because if im the butt of a joke at least i belong
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just dont like making fun of people in general even if they initiate it first unless i know the person really well and their sense of humor selfdepreciating humor leads down some dark roads if the person has anything but good selfesteem
LifeProTips,not_removed,the tyrion gambit
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who does this yeah youre right i mean if i joke about myself youre allowed to have a crack too but dont take it as an invitation to go to town
LifeProTips,not_removed,or maybe they are just making a joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a pretty high self esteem and i often make selfdepreciating jokes i suppose it depends on the people around you and how you make the joke in my case theyre mostly funny and i make them whildt confident and laughing of course someone with low self esteem should start with not making that kind of jokes in the first place in my opinion
LifeProTips,not_removed,i purposefully do this for one im funnier than you and two i was bullied quite often and it stripped them of their power so to speak so now its just habit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked with a guy once who told me a great saying dont laugh at others unless you can laugh at yourself first now i really enjoy laughing at others so if im being self deprecating i usually am you better believe ill be laughing at you soon enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont make fun of people because thats being a dick your theory about the motivations of self deprecating people is totally off base
LifeProTips,not_removed,people can also self deprecate to gain attentioncompliments its pretty frustrating
LifeProTips,not_removed,how come mods allow this thread but they closed
LifeProTips,not_removed,my friend was this way in college i would constantly try to build him up because while i may have had looks and the social skills he had everything i wish i could the brains ability to catch on quickly and all around charismatic in is own way anthony if youre out there youre my guy
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha ha the real comedy is the tragedy we all are
LifeProTips,not_removed,or it could be that they like making jokes but dont want to have hr called in them
LifeProTips,not_removed,the only people i know who arent self deprecating take themselves too seriously its occasionally a preemptive strike but if you dont find yourself slightly ridiculous youre probably fooling yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,i try to tell self deprecating people to stop abe positive because it helps everyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,i knew this guy that whenever i would make jokes about myself that made him laugh bc that was the point he would instantly apologize then spend the next min saying what a horrible person he was and how great i was which was not my intention at all it would put such a damper on the whole coversation that eventually i flipped out and told him to stop that it wasnt necessary that it was me making a joke at my own expense i didnt need an appology which prompted him to apologize yet again that was not a fun situation eventually i just stopped making jokes cause it never had the right effect
LifeProTips,not_removed,i spent a majority of high school and college being the self deprecating guy although im usually very sociable and can talk my way through many groups and situations there are people just like op said im very forgiving too so i brush off the fun they make of me but other times they abuse my sincerity and take my feelings for granted especially that one guy in college who just constantly makes me the butt of his jokes knocking me in the head etc even though not everyone bought it i have good friends too ya know while i still consider him a friend but a piece of me wants to knock some sense into him but im never an aggressive person to do something like that so please people everyone is human take care of each others feelings some of us can or voluntarily take the beating but we have our emotional limits too dont take advantage of that and possible ruin their day or even their life
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm i do this daily ill hurt myself before i let you hurt me
LifeProTips,not_removed,this isnt the case for most self deprecating people like most say i enjoy being made fun of if its done well if its a really good burn on me everyone should laugh including me
LifeProTips,not_removed,its ok to laugh at people who are self deprecating if they do it they kinda expect a laugh your guy just sounds annoying
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think they want to theyre just used to doing that
LifeProTips,not_removed,wtf is this doing on the front page who over makes fun of people at least when theyre around is reddit really modded read only by teenagers now
LifeProTips,not_removed,you could just end it at dont make fun of people thats a great lpt and being good to people will never steer you wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,reddit being reddit i assume this tip doesnt apply to amy schumer
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is true source me irl atm
LifeProTips,not_removed,eh ive been selfdeprecating since before i can remember maybe im depressed maybe i just have that kind of quirk or maybe i just dont give a shit what is said about me so i dont bother defending myself even against myself
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think its a function of low self confidence so same principle
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree if they take what i say seriously or are scared to be made fun of theyre not exactly mentally healthy good way to find people you dont want at your house party or social gatherings
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh no my greatest secret has been revealed
LifeProTips,not_removed,better advice is dont get caught up in relationshipsfriendships with people who are selfdeprecating theyre too busy lying to themselves and protecting their egos to be of any value
LifeProTips,not_removed,a great example of that when patrick stewart tried making fun of james corden at an award show but just ended up dying on his arse
LifeProTips,not_removed,that all depends on if im being a dumbass at the time if im sitting there reading a book calling me a dumbass would upset me now if i say hold my beer im going to ride this cow on the highway then youre just being honest
LifeProTips,not_removed,sure is i know i am a dumbassyou i am not so certain
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah you actually believe it you dumbass
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks mitch truly the hero we
LifeProTips,not_removed,not anymore not any less
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have pretty big self esteem but and are pretty selfdepricating because im an easy target and i think its funny one friend of mine though when in company with other people and me will lay it on thick theres a running joke im a year old princess im a mid twenties bearded big dude who goes to the gym three times a week not important hos that came to be but i think its pretty fun this guy though hell just shoot off joke after joke after joke and the same ones most nights like im not offended but youre really not reading the room here most people are afraid ill just flip my shit on him one day because he pushed it too far im just honestly annoyed at the poor attempt of rehashing the same three jokes he has like nobodys laughing weve heard them from you dozens of times before take a hint im not offended because my feelings are hurt im offended because its just poor comedy by now
LifeProTips,not_removed,intrue if you cant make fun of yourself then who can you make fun of if you cant take it dont dish it out
LifeProTips,not_removed,just joke about having a little sick and everyone will laugh
LifeProTips,not_removed,i personally do it as an ice breaker so that feel confident in saying whatever to me without them worrying about my feelings if someone is worried about offending you the conversation is already limited and not natural at least in my opinion
LifeProTips,not_removed,could you elaborate on that
LifeProTips,not_removed,when im building new relationships either at work or with new friends i tend to inevitably hit a phase where im making my mom jokes your mom jokes are a whole can of worms but my mom jokes catch people off guard are nicely selfdeprecating and inoffensive to everyone except my mom but i dont even call her that this inevitably catches on as a form of joke in some way within the group and you can start to tell who the jerks are most people will start to joke about their own mothers but theres always a few wholl miss the point and start saying potentially offensive things about my mother its an easy way to guage sense of humour and social intelligence which are very important traits to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,no problem i wish it didnt strike a chord with you but glad i could help anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly at least your getting the laugh from it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think op means dont starting roasting them like make a joke and move on not destroy their will to live
LifeProTips,not_removed,waiting for someone else to say this agree
LifeProTips,not_removed,i disagree you cant say dont make fun of people full stop because its naive to think that can ever happen and joke can be made and taken in good humour my lpt is like a moral compass to show you the way to keep it in that well received good humour boundary im interested why you think its off base
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use selfdeprivation to address the elephant mobility aid in the room ive noticed a lot of other people with disabilities do it too its a faster and more light hearted way to let everyone know im different but you dont need to walk on eggshells because of it
LifeProTips,not_removed,they might change their minds but dont hold your breath
LifeProTips,not_removed,obviously the amy schumer immunity still applies here
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh my god with the amy schumer hate seeping into everything on reddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,not mentally healthy is an disgusting thing to say about someone for taking a joke seriously or not wanting to be made fun of as in literally everyone in the world at some point when your through with having house parties you really need to grow up and realise that you cant put people down who dont jel with you by calling them not mentally healthy
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the whole of britain single and friendless then coming from a brit
LifeProTips,not_removed,man i love patrick stewart but that was insanely difficult to watch how unfortunate
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh god you can see the moment james gets mad but stewart just falls apart under the pressure
LifeProTips,not_removed,what the fuck why did he do that that was so cold and out of touch
LifeProTips,not_removed,do i remember ian mckellen doing something like this as well a few weeks back
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dunno i honestly dont think stewart meant that as a joke it seemed malicious there was no smile on his face when he said it the hands in pocket comment wasnt a joke as in there was nothing even potentially funny about it and the fat shaming comment was just a low blow to try and get his edge back after he had been shut down
LifeProTips,not_removed,remindme
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry but youre
LifeProTips,not_removed,you sound just like my dadthe real one
LifeProTips,not_removed,we what
LifeProTips,not_removed,or laugh about your female genitals and get your own show
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha ha this guy has a small sick
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah same
LifeProTips,not_removed,i totally agree with this i think it lets people know that youre comfortable enough socially to let your guard down i have seen people take it too far and rip on themselves all the time which is an awkward defense mechanism but some light self humor is a nice ice breaker especially if your personality comes across as stand offish normally
LifeProTips,not_removed,in the uk selfdeprecation is expected and a major part of the sense of humour here noone will think youre actually putting yourself down its just part of the way we talk to each other in the same way bigging yourself up or taking yourself seriously are major sins it makes you seem insecure and foolish it might seem counterintuitive but telling everyone how rubbish you are can actually be a sign of confidence here as youre showing humility and that youre comfortable with your own weaknesses in my experience of talking to americans you often see selfdeprecation as a sign of a lack of confidence or of depression as the title of this post implies ive had americans try to cheer me up and boost my self esteem because i mocked myself a bit which was charming but completely unnecessary you definitely take yourselves more seriously than we do
LifeProTips,not_removed,that wasnt his point
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is simply a huge estimation on part of the op everyone have their own circumstances and personality this generic advice is not helping at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,right the post seemed very negative for no reason
LifeProTips,not_removed,riamveryfunny
LifeProTips,not_removed,because self deprecating humour isnt always as negative as your lpt insinuates people can tag on themselves and still appreciate a joke on their behalf go watch any roast ever made
LifeProTips,not_removed,nice
LifeProTips,not_removed,you must be young as you get older you start to see the world differently you stop seeing what people say as an attack on your person but more of a reflection of what theyre feeling on the inside if you let things get to you you attribute your self worth to anything you cant control like peoples opinions about you youre never going to feel like youre worth much hell you might be angry and take it out on others with your negativity also common is the inability to give constructive criticism if youre disgusted by what i said you yourself might be a little off were not talking about starving children here disgusting is the fact that weve elected a living meme that asked about nuclear codes before he was even elected
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i know james had been making fun of himself and patrick got giddy and thought oh great i can make a few jokes no no you cant i do love patrick stewart though what a guy
LifeProTips,not_removed,patrick is a bit out of touch in general hes a brilliant actor a fantastic orator but his delivery of his jokes was not landing because no one is waiting to laugh when hes speaking ever comedians generally warm up an audience in their acts and in a similar way through their careers it carries through their stage presence to a point where some comedians walk on stage and people laugh before anything has really happened but patrick stewart is a man of class dignity and authority his jokes became insults when he failed to warm up his audience to the idea that what he was going to say wasnt his real criticisms tldr if he had charmed james and the audience and read the room first he damn well could have gotten away with one or two jabbing jokes but he didnt so he didnt earn his right to joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,arent they the same person lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah what a dumbass
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not your pal guy
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks for clearing that up im actually not american but i can see what you mean i currently live in the uk which is why i was curious about what you said
LifeProTips,not_removed,billion people over countries yeah im not expecting to group everyone in one sentence this is my opinion if people agree theyll upvote and so the circle of reddit goes on and generic advice is all youll ever get on reddit what do you want lpt zgetsu dont forget your paperwork this morning
LifeProTips,not_removed,but you just said dont make fun of people now your saying self deprecating people can take a joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,you attribute your self worth to anything you cant control like peoples opinions about you if there is anyone who seems rather young and is holding naive opinions it is yourself peoples opinions about you are well within most of your control immutable aspects of this are if the individual is inherently phobic towards certain people or hold racist sexist and other prejudicial beliefs however you do have a lot of control as to how people perceive you claiming someone is mentally unhealthy because youve made jokes at the cost of someone else without knowing the circumstances that put them in that position is ludicrous its not funny to make fun of someones disabilities illnesses among many other things its just rude and indicative that youre an awful individual this sort of humour is juvenile and expected of high school students not mature adults who have a higher emotional intelligence are socially and contextually aware
LifeProTips,not_removed,way to write off every disagreement as a mental illness you must be so fun at those house parties but what do i know clearly theres something off with me and youve got all the answers
LifeProTips,not_removed,who said i took it as an attack on myself i never said i was offended by what you said just that i basically thought you were a dick for saying it its basically a reflection of what im feeling on the inside constructive criticism is not saying your not mentally healthy for not wanting to be made fun of or taking something seriously thats called bullying
LifeProTips,not_removed,very deep a reflection of what they are feeling on the inside im gonna remember that one
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the opposite of what you say in your post
LifeProTips,not_removed,as are trump and bush
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey im not your guy pal
LifeProTips,not_removed,im here to i dont know get a real lpt definitely not looking for a generic advice that doesnt offer any real tips
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think i ever said that what i said was people can be self deprecating because they know its a good joke not because im trying to not get made fun of if im ragging on myself im sure as shit going to enjoy someone else doing the same if its in good taste anyway your post was removed because others saw it made no sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,how are they relevant or must trump just be relevant by law nowadays
LifeProTips,not_removed,op did offer a real tip take it or leave it
LifeProTips,not_removed,you must be really fun at parties
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok well if you turn the pull tab on a can over the drinking hole it makes a cool holder for a straw your welcome
LifeProTips,not_removed,didnt
LifeProTips,not_removed,you should have used this then the halfassed attempt at social commentary
LifeProTips,not_removed,people and counting like my half asses social commentary so ill just stick with that thanks edit sorry its like half asses social commentary now my bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,looks like it was removed i guess in the end no one liked it
LifeProTips,not_removed,no see the upvotes that means people liked it its pretty simple really
LifeProTips,not_removed,really cause it went up by when i messaged you doesnt sound very down voted to me but im guessing you have access to information i dont right this isnt a shower thought though i dont know why youre getting in such a hissy fit over it it is a generalisation but it has to be cause to make it stupidly specific and it wont apply to anyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,but when you made it this general it also applies to no one you see that right if someone makes fun of themselves it wouldnt prevent people from also making a joke at your expense i guess im bothered by it because it applies to no one and holds no truth its not even a life pro tip its a misguided opinion
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres a reason why this post was removed people upvoting only means they find this relatable in an echo chamber community people that think this sucks dont even bother downvoting this is still not a lpt its laughable to think updoot means youre right
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a very limited knowledge of this aka one job experience so take this advice with a grain of salt for me i took it as let them know if i get another job offer so i interviewed with company a but they didnt have any positions open i dont know why they interviewed me but they did they told me to keep in touch so when i got another job offer from company b i called my company a interviewer and said i got an offer from company b the interviewer asked when i had to acceptdecline the offer from company b and i was totally honest and said two weeks one week later company a offered me a job
LifeProTips,not_removed,a few things first make a linkedincom profile then find the recruiter and friend them linkedin is sort of like facebook for business contacts there are probably youtube videos on linkedin basics it will resemble a resume at first but a little less formal dont be discouraged if you dont have much resume at first second dont email too much send them a note when you are about two months from graduating not before then follow up about a month later no more third dont assume anything in other words keep looking for other options in case this falls through
LifeProTips,not_removed,make a professional profile on linked in connect with himher on linked in occasionally update himher with your progess post interesting relevant things and make thoughtful comments
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would join linked in and link all your ex co workers
LifeProTips,not_removed,but you dont get paid as much because the staffing agent gets a percentage of your salary
LifeProTips,not_removed,it is a balancing act if you find a good staffing agency and you manage them properly then yes you can have good results i have found many good jobs though by going directly to the sites of companies
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive found that most recruiters are usually just entry level college graduates who stay with their company for about a year i knew that i spent time developing a professional relationship with two guys who both left their companies for different ventures ive also had an interview for an amazing company that was exactly what i wanted i went on the interview and i had never left more confident i would at least get a second interview if not the job the interviewer told my recruiter that she thought i would not be a good fit and would want to use me for another role below the title i am at id always felt a good recruiter would try to give some pushback and find out why especially considering how smooth the whole interview was
LifeProTips,not_removed,i also heard through the grapevine that a lot of times hrrecruiting departments will post openings for positions that arent really open online in order to keep a constant inventory of potential candidates in the event they needed someone right away in case someone quits goes on medical leave etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,nice advice staffing agency recruiter
LifeProTips,not_removed,umm and how does one go about finding said good staffing agency
LifeProTips,not_removed,what about offline sites
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends some agencies that hire you as a contractor have a pay structure where you get paid an hour and the agency makes an hour ive also known that some agencies will charge clients a one time percentage based fee off of your salary so they fight to give you the highest salary
LifeProTips,not_removed,this isnt correct at all they charge clients a bill rate that is between to more than the wage for the position the contracting employee is paid the normal wage or in some cases more than the wage to compensate for lacking paid benefits for instance i have software engineering contractors that will earn or for a job we would hire them as an fte for but we pay their vendor close to for the service of finding maintaining and paying their contractor
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is the price you pay for connections and having a organization motivated in putting you in a job asap
LifeProTips,not_removed,from my experience the base pay is so much better and most of the time its contracttohire that its still far better i went from an hour jobs to an hour
LifeProTips,not_removed,recruiters are just people that arent qualified to do other jobs themselves so they decided to basically be a pimp and pimp people out to jobs they have no idea how to do themselves
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes and they also baitandswitch you apply for that temptohire an hour job and they call you in and give you an hour options
LifeProTips,not_removed,heshe is actually not wrong the pay may not be great because some do take a portion of your salary but if youre fresh out of college you get to learn on the job skills you may not have learned by taking the traditional route
LifeProTips,not_removed,it depends on your field most staffing agencies are based in large cities so run a google search for staffing agencies in the nearest large city and research them to see what they specialize in
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think temp agencies are the ones that try and maximize profits by paying very little staffing agencies focused more on matching you with the best possible job for instance the one im currently with charges a an hour premium during the length of the contract and pressure the hiring company to hire full time but they specialize in it work which tends to be a bit more lucrative than factory and construction work which temp agencies seem to be more involved with
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for correcting them i think most people dont realize the incredible markup they get
LifeProTips,not_removed,absolutely but its something to keep in mind
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah ive seen that especially for entrylevel management positions usually means its an entry level desk job doing menial work and every one starts there and they can move up to management in time
LifeProTips,not_removed,that doesnt mean you shouldnt look at other ways to find jobs
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked for a temp agency and it called itself a staffing agency if you are being hired as a contractor for the agency you are being hosed
LifeProTips,not_removed,most of the time its like a trial period with the company yea they doc pay but its for services rendered saddly lots of companies are outsourcing their hr
LifeProTips,not_removed,i never said that
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends if its the agency pushing for contract or the company sounds like theres a lot of different agencies with a lot of different agendas i can only say what ive experienced and thats interviews with companies looking for a month contract with an end goal to hire full time contract work allows the company to test out a perspective full time employee they dont have to pay benefits because of contract title and if the employee doesnt work out they can always queue the next one if your job as no possibility of ever being full time then yes i agree youre getting hosed
LifeProTips,not_removed,you said the person who said to not do that was not wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,my state wont let you get a state id if you have a drivers license you can have one or the other state id in my state is for non drivers only not sure how many states are like that
LifeProTips,not_removed,i prefer to be anonymous
LifeProTips,not_removed,and what happens when they break into your car and now have your license a common crime is people break into your car find your address and then go straight to your house knowing you more than likely arent there they can see your age and guess if you live with parents or what not they then scope the house out and break in if it looks empty this is why most states are taking addresses off of registration dmv advises to keep it in a locked glove box or on you at all times also in most states if you have a drivers license and get pulled over without it you can show up to court or sheriffs office and show the the license to get the ticket thrown out if you even get one
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh interesting if youre within driving distance of another state you may be able to get it there i live in new jersey but i border new york my id card is new york while my drivers license is nj the county where i live in is one of the most populated counties in the country so dmvs are absolutely awful there the neighboring ny county is comparatively small compared to my county so the dmv is much more manageable there
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you ever get your issue worked out
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive got a station wagon no one is breaking into my car if they do then so be it
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah so you have them from states gotcha coz pretty sure ny wont let you have both a drivers license and a state id at least the did not when i lived there i live in ct now and they sure do not allow that here ny and ct not sure about jersey require you to be a resident to obtain either ia license or state id so if you live in nj and went over the border for an ny license technically you committed fraud what did you show them for proof of residency in ny coz they sure do require that i know have had one in ny and my ex wife a non driver has one still
LifeProTips,not_removed,i showed them my points of id with my nj drivers license as part of that point combination the identification was mailed to me a couple weeks later from albany which listed my nj address on it so i honestly do not believe i committed fraud if both the physical mvc allowed me to go through and obtain a ny id card as a nj resident and then albany printed my id card with a nj address and mailed it to me knowing that i was a resident of nj
LifeProTips,not_removed,yah i definitely call bullshit they wont issue you an ny non driver id to a nj address they just wont it takes points of id with at least one of them showing a ny address or points of id plus proof of address and that address has to be in ny went through this myself getting an ny non driver id with a ct license once had to bring in my lease to prove i lived in ny
LifeProTips,not_removed,ill pm you a pic of my id card once i get home with my nj address listed on it i even called the mvc to make sure it was acceptable to obtain a ny id card with an out of state residence
LifeProTips,not_removed,must have either recently changed in the last years or you have photoshop
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you dont believe me you can give the ny mvc a call yourself theyll let you know that its allowed i wasnt asked any questions about it either so it seemed that the local mvc workers were used to completing this for out of state residents
LifeProTips,not_removed,way ahead of you did that they said no
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is the perceived benefit of clear ice
LifeProTips,not_removed,doesnt work its tiny air bubbles created as the water freezes which makes them appear cloudy youd need to put a very thin layer of water in the ice cube tray let that freeze and repeat about times to get a clear ice cube
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you use boiling water it also melts all the food next to it when you put it in the freezer
LifeProTips,not_removed,deleted
LifeProTips,not_removed,use filtered water and itll make it much more clear than this noticed a pretty big difference in clarity when i got a filter on the tap and started using that instead
LifeProTips,not_removed,aesthetics
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree i saw this tip a ways back and while some of i was clear the heart of the cube is cloudy
LifeProTips,not_removed,or use distilled water
LifeProTips,not_removed,why on earth do so many people seem to care about the clarity of their ice cubes
LifeProTips,not_removed,youll die
LifeProTips,not_removed,it looks nicer and gives a sense of accomplishment when the rest of their life may not be going according to plan
LifeProTips,not_removed,people are high class morons
LifeProTips,not_removed,presentation
LifeProTips,not_removed,why would you die
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe not die but distilled water is going to dissolve a lot of really useful stuff on its way down and make you sick
LifeProTips,not_removed,well thats some bullshit you think distilled water leaches nutrients out of your body you could make the argument that it isnt replacing minerals but remember we are talking about ice cubes not drinking only distilled water for months plus most of the nutrients are from food anyway so that likely wouldnt make any difference either
LifeProTips,not_removed,there is nothing harmful about distilled water millions of people have been drinking naturally distilled water for thousands of years its called rain water collection the evaporation of water from the seas and condensation as rain is the very definition of distillation nobody has gotten sick from rain water unless the air was polluted
LifeProTips,not_removed,or you should just do it most resolutions go unfulfilled because people feel the need to just come up with one you want to make a change do it dont put some fancy title on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont sleep on your kids bed its a piece of shit you bought on sale

LifeProTips,not_removed,at the grocery store aldi specifically
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just play the game yourself until youre content because enjoyment isnt a waste of time there ya go the real lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,i started redownloading buying reinstalling old games over the past few years for this same reason but i quickly learned that i didnt want to physically play the game i just wanted to satisfy the nostalgia of seeing it in front of me hearing the game music and sounds again and seeing the relevant progressionboss fightsendings again
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks i was about to say something similar
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hear a lot of responses aimed towards getting rid of video games my perspective is that playing videogames instead of doing what you need to is a symptom not the problem itself try listing the positives that come from the things you need to do they can be short term money in the bank or long term feeling a sense of progression but focus more on the positives of your todos rather than the negatives of video gaming on the other hand if youre finding it difficult to find something that lifts you up enough to get things done use video games remind yourself how much sweeter itll be to play after you put in the effort of doing the things you need to do hope that helps i know not everyone is the same but that was the advice that helped me kick the habit of playing video games to escape my duties
LifeProTips,not_removed,do everything you need to get done first then use video game as a reward

LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel like buying a house but i lack the funds to do so you can feel like doing something but not have the capacity or resources to do so
LifeProTips,not_removed,i want to die should i just do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i understand where you are coming from but i think op was directing this to behaviors we want rather than owning things ie a consistent work out regime not snaking on sugary foods meditating daily etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe removable fabric tape would help hold them in place
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe magnets little magnets
LifeProTips,not_removed,my pant loops work well for tucking in the rest of a belt a tailor would probably charge very little to add a couple
LifeProTips,not_removed,are they long enough to tie them into a bow
LifeProTips,not_removed,huh thats actually super clever
LifeProTips,not_removed,mmm see its made out of the same fabric as the dress and so adding belt loops would probably totally ruin the blendiness
LifeProTips,not_removed,not even nearly unfortunately about inches on each side
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks im thinking something like but i bet youll find ones you like most
LifeProTips,not_removed,which ever one you can get its no time to be fussy or think anything is beneath you apply for everything and settle for anything work hard at it and instill a good work ethic in yourself apply yourself in school and train to become whatever it is you want to be in the long run
LifeProTips,not_removed,grocery stores are used to working with school schedules and you avoid that lingering smell that accompanies food service jobs
LifeProTips,not_removed,camp counselor get paid to go swimming and play dodge ball during the year i was a tutor at a tutoring center get paid to read with kids and punt dealing with the parents to the manager
LifeProTips,not_removed,lifeguard it will get you laid you can stay really fit very little actual work and you may never see an accidentincident you will learn to work with kids and becoming a swim teamdivingwater polosync swim coach will team you a lot about how to teach people
LifeProTips,not_removed,there are lots of great one already but im going to call out food service in particular you probably cant get a job waiting tables in high school but if you can start there if not go fast food why because you learn more patience there than anywhere else in the universe you will see people at their worst hangry and you will most of the time give them the thing that their irrational animal brain wants most at that moment food you learn how to handle criticism you learn how to multitask and you form trench bonds with your coworkers it may not sound super appealing but working in food service is an experience that i believe should be required so that we learn to be nicer to each other plus once you get to college you can wait tables and make as much in nights as you will in your first real job make sure you quit and go be a camp counselor in the summer though that was a good suggestion
LifeProTips,not_removed,any job i would say i just recently got a job at a bar downtown as a dishwasher though i only work on saturdays if it doesnt conflict with your schedule id say go for it best places to start are fast food joints and grocery stores since theyre mostly minimum wage jobs and are usually flexible as to when you have to work
LifeProTips,not_removed,anything any job is good when youre starting out as it gets you into hopefully good work habits and an all important reference for moving on to other jobs but the easiest things are probably babysitting or pet care for neighbours or casual retail or food service jobs
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you can get a job doing something youre into and may pursue further thats awesome i teach and in hs i worked as a oneonone social aide for children with autism and nannied gave me great experience for college essays waiting tables made me quick cash so weekend brunches paid me as well as a full week of after school retail retail was awesome for clothing discounts and to buy gifts for holidays with a discount if you can get perks and pay thats a great use of your time
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you can get it the front desk at a gym is awesome free gym membership most of your time is at the front desk so you can do some homework if its not busy and usually just some light cleaninganswering questions
LifeProTips,not_removed,grocery stores specifically ones that are local to your region and tend not to be huge they often will work around your schedule and teach you a lot about customer service
LifeProTips,not_removed,im in my senior year now and i work at a gas station times a week the shifts are nearly hours long meaning i literally head there from school to work luckily from roughly the place is a ghost town so i can do my homework listen to music and reddit but it can be really rough leaving for school at am and getting home at pm its ok though im just working on becoming a more materialistic greedy person to convince myself this is all somehow worth it ¯ツ¯
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked as a hostess several times it taught me great people skills and how to greetinteract with strangers its also pretty easy to get this type of job gl
LifeProTips,not_removed,any job in a restaurant youll be fed its hard but good work if you keepyour eyes and ears open you may learn enough to cook for yourself when youre adulting you may find a passion for it and build a career in it the majority of the places youll be as you go through life will have some sort of restaurant and if youve worked in one and done well youll be able to find work in another should the need arise most importantly sos love people who can cook
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked in a small hardware store for my first job i learned about all sorts of things like basic plumbing electrical work tools etc helps when fixing things around the house
LifeProTips,not_removed,find someone to teach you how to sell on ebay
LifeProTips,not_removed,lifeguarding you mostly work during the summer with some off season hours depending on where you work super chill environment and you get to tan as you work
LifeProTips,not_removed,the one closest to your home
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work at a corn maze and adventure park they are cool about letting us set our schedules its still a job but its better than mcdonalds
LifeProTips,not_removed,i worked in fast food and learned how to get alongwork with all sorts of people manage stressful situations nothing like working a lunch rush and bonus its great motivation to go to college i worked in a tuxedo store taking measurements and preparing orders and learned a lot about dealing with people smiling even when customers were rude and bonus got a serious reality check on wedding insanity worked for an outdoor catering company think big company picnics and learned how to man a grill like a boss plus saturdays and sundays outside in a beautiful park all summer this was southern california so guaranteed good weather if i were young and doing it again id definitely add pool lifeguard or camp counselor
LifeProTips,not_removed,working at a car dealer if you like to drive new cars every day and get paid well its for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,anything honestly just find something thats flexible to your schedule
LifeProTips,not_removed,camp counselor is great also mow lawns and shovel driveways build up a base of customers and invest some of the money into buying a little trailer new weed wacker used snowblower and so forth pretty soon you have your own small business with flexible hours no fast food smell no boss a friend of mine worked at this no more than i did at regular jobs but built up a business that sent him to college and left it up and running for his mom when she wanted to go to work after he left
LifeProTips,not_removed,lifeguard in pays pretty well
LifeProTips,not_removed,pizza delivery driver you only have to work half the time the other half you are driving back to the store you have to get the pizza there fast but you can take your sweet time getting back you get to listen to your kick ass stereo system in your car while you work free food tips possibility although very remote of some sort of real life porno being acted out where a sexy nympho supermodel orders a pizza but when you get to the house all she wants is to jump your bones

LifeProTips,not_removed,mcdonalds isnt a bad job ether you could do way worse ive worked in a lot of major fast food places in high schoolbeginning college and mcdonalds was by far my favorite and they payed the best
LifeProTips,not_removed,just meant fast food in general ive had to many friends whove tried it and hated it they either got hours a week or never got a raise after being there for all of high school
LifeProTips,not_removed,probably shouldnt eat in the car especially if its a nice car
LifeProTips,not_removed,future self fuck him whats he ever done for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah people dont use bananas for scale because its helpful at one point a redditor posted a picture of a creepy nook in his house with several bizarre objects inside one of which was a very outofplace banana that he claimed to have placed there for scale no one thinks bananas are a reliable way to establish size in a photo youre just not in on the joke
LifeProTips,not_removed,except do not take pictures of money
LifeProTips,not_removed,why
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think it is borderline illegal reason being people might use pictures of money as money i think there are workarounds fake money allowed for movies etc but who wants a lawyer just so they can show for scale
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes i am sure people do it i just suppose it gives headaches to the secret service
LifeProTips,not_removed,lawyer for scale
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres no such thing as borderline illegal its either illegal or not taking a photo of money is not illegal movie studios do make replica cash because it would be really dumb to have half a million in actual cash on a movie set to film a bank robbery scene they make it reasonably close to the real thing so that you cant really tell when watching but fake enough to avoid counterfeiting charges
LifeProTips,not_removed,what are you talking about the secret service protects highprofile government officials its also completely legal to photograph money a picture of a dollar cannot be used as a substitute for a dollar
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha yeah ok except im not really
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for the link confirming that you are wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,deescalate while maintaining a threatening pose hmm
LifeProTips,not_removed,is got it ill get right in his face
LifeProTips,not_removed,and then start the macarena dance or pretend youre a zombie because those are the only reasons to have your arms up like that
LifeProTips,not_removed,second this also dont point as that is an act of aggression and can escalate things rapidly hands open arms extended per op defines your safe zone and keeps you ready to act if necessary the rule of self defense is dont be there but if you cannot leave or avoid it also whatever is necessary to survive
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you keep screaming your name it forces the assailant to acknowledge you as a human
LifeProTips,not_removed,and you get to look like a huge pussy
LifeProTips,not_removed,if someone enters your space in an aggressive manner that is already a threatening act if they want to feel threatened by you putting your hands up in a defensive position you are better off letting them feel that way than risk being sucker punched
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a little long winded a simple stay back should suffice ask tell make never turn your back on an aggressive person
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a defensive pose not a threatening pose if the person is close enough to strike you you should either move away or poor your hands up
LifeProTips,not_removed,that works well unless they follow you screaming and now your back is turned and they are a foot away still screaming
LifeProTips,not_removed,mama dint raise no bitch
LifeProTips,not_removed,getting ready for the whatwhat shove
LifeProTips,not_removed,scary heavy metal guy in capri pants gtfo
LifeProTips,not_removed,i learned that the hard way you never expect to get punched in the back of the head
LifeProTips,not_removed,you may see it that way but hes looking like hes trying to calm down her aggression she obviously is in a fighting stance ready for action while hes all mellow looking like his finger is raised in a just a minute there phrase or to put it another way if any of my tenants raised their hands to me like she is im taking that as they are getting ready to physically attack me and i need to defend myself which aggressively escalates a situation if you want body language to deescalate a situation id not raise arms ready to attack
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have no idea why people here seem so confused by the universal sign for leave me alone dont get closer which is hands up palms out that i thought everyone knew instinctively
LifeProTips,not_removed,a better way to do this is to keep one of the hands up in the position and the other hand flat on your chest it looks much less threatening and youre still able to defend yourself from sucker punches
LifeProTips,not_removed,do you mean like
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,in that situation you would have to be escalating the situation and being aggressive to your tenants making them afraid you were going to hurt them otherwise the op advice does not apply to your tenant the advice is not if youre having a conversation with someone who is just talking to you throw your hands in their face incase theyre secretly planning to hit you that would obviously be aggressive context is important the advice applies only to a specific scenario you are changing the context which would change an observers perception of the defender obviously
LifeProTips,not_removed,or the old pretend like your scratching your beard trick
LifeProTips,not_removed,fair enough you are right to say you should aim to deescalate whenever possible its just not always possible
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like to rub my nose
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love this scene so much
LifeProTips,not_removed,he got knocked out how is that bragging
LifeProTips,not_removed,no he said the guy hit him but then regretted it because badass op knocked him out before the police could even walk over and break up the fight
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha that is actually pretty great
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh youre right my bad
LifeProTips,not_removed,well if you have a doctoryou should askyour doctor
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use earkare which is made by an ear doctor at silverstein institute here in sarasota fl you can purchase it online httpwwwearsinuscompatientsearkare im not sure why your doctor couldnt get all the wax out i once had a general doctor flush my ear with water to unplug it and that worked years later i was having problems with my left ear and got referred to the silverstein institute they tweezed the wax out which was super painful they said qtips actually push the wax further in the offer the earkare its really easy to use you do it twice a week in the shower i havent used a qtip since
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah im kinda having that pain right now tbh on the left ear my speculation is that instead of using an effective hydrogen peroxide ℅ and water he only used water instead and on top of that it took him a good before prescribing me the drops im going back there on saturday so ill see what will happen then
LifeProTips,not_removed,he lies his ass off

LifeProTips,not_removed,eat grapes for every meal they are nutritious taste good and keep you hydrated
LifeProTips,not_removed,only in small doeses
LifeProTips,not_removed,i forgive you and i dont even know you score
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes its not that action that is the real issue its difficult but perhaps a deeper conversation is necessary to cut away all the garbage and get to why it upset your so communication and finding common ground and a plan going forward are to me the most important in a relationship discussion asking her why she was upset at what you did what can you do in the future to not upset her like that what is fair or not ie is it something you like to do but it was just an inappropriate time and lastly its whatever works for you both youll develop your way of solving problems that works for both of you or dont what do i care
LifeProTips,not_removed,talk about what you did wrong and figure out how you can avoid it from happening then proceed with your plan
LifeProTips,not_removed,give a heartfelt apology do not follow the apology with an explanation of why you did what you did that will just undermine the apology
LifeProTips,not_removed,talk clearly things are not right by what you say people get mad but get over it start with the treats etc to break the ice is what i would do
LifeProTips,not_removed,therapist here specifically a systemic therapist who focuses on communication there are two levels of communication the report aspect and the command aspect report is the information in the communication take out the trash or id like to have sex with you doggystyle command is meta and is information about the relationship between the two communicants take out the trash would mean two different things from a father to his son and from a pimp who just executed a rival how does this help you sometimes couples get into arguments and paradoxically agree on what is going on but yet still disagree the classic example is a man who invites his friend to stay with him and his wife after losing his home the wife agrees that the man should be allowed to stay and agrees with her husbands decision but yet they are still arguing why because they are arguing on the wrong communication level the argument isnt over whether it was right or wrong but rather who has the right to make a unilateral decision in the relationship how does this help you are you apologizing for what you did the report or are you apologizing for how you defined the relationship the command if you can figure out which one you will have much better success
LifeProTips,not_removed,actually when mine screws up he just comes and stands really close to me and looks like a puppy it works idiot

LifeProTips,not_removed,time ok ramen noodles cook fast but you can also get them without the seasoning and everything money wot is ramen really that cheap in america in switzerland you pay for a kg of spaghetti and for a pack of ramen
LifeProTips,not_removed,so cook the ramen like italian noodles drain the water and pour hot spaghetti sauce over it or cook the ramen noodles in the spaghetti sauce
LifeProTips,not_removed,either could work i did the former because it was a last minute decision
LifeProTips,not_removed,assuming the bar staff havent taken it or handed it over to the first person to approach them and ask if anyone has handed in a thats really bad advice at least in the uk
LifeProTips,not_removed,what could go wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,sorry sir not lost coats here
LifeProTips,not_removed,i usually put my jacket right over a stool example have it open and the back of the jacket is covering the seat then sit on your jacket
LifeProTips,not_removed,safe to say not just in the uk but anywhere in the world
LifeProTips,not_removed,your coat could get mysterious stains on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,we are really using the term pro losely here
LifeProTips,not_removed,also splash water where on the back of your neck scientifically proven way to cool off quickly for athletes
LifeProTips,not_removed,dunking the feet works better imo
LifeProTips,not_removed,in our restaurant sink i just hose down my hands and up to my elbows with icy cold water until my arms are very cold logic being theyll warm up within a minute because all my blood is going to circulate through and soak all the coldness up and pump it back through my body even just doing your hands till theyre numb is an awesome way to take heat off your body
LifeProTips,not_removed,an emt told me to put coldice packs in your armpits and between your legs groin area definitely worked for me this was more of a nearlyheatstroke situation than a just trying to cool off thing but yeah
LifeProTips,not_removed,ice or run water on the insides of your wrists
LifeProTips,not_removed,wet a paper towel with cold water and wring out place on the back of your neck repeat as necessary
LifeProTips,not_removed,when cold stuff comes into contact with hot stuff the hot stuff gets less hot
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you plan to pay for someones meal dont be a tight arse
LifeProTips,not_removed,seriously hey guy this is on me but you can only use the dollar menu this person must have friends that fucking hate them
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt or common sense 🤔
LifeProTips,not_removed,a lot longer really my water is hot within like seconds
LifeProTips,not_removed,if youre shower takes longer than say seconds tops on any heat excluding during the dead of winter maybe you should consider a water heater upgrade
LifeProTips,not_removed,im sorry that you didn´t realize that this is a common repost

LifeProTips,not_removed,but dont try to time it to end at a certain time eg real midnight because the countdown ends about
LifeProTips,not_removed,what why would they do that
LifeProTips,not_removed,to play some music after the countdown ends so its not complete silence
LifeProTips,not_removed,is that a guess or is that what happens is he trying to say the countdown is only an hour and a half but still goes down to one or that it cuts off
LifeProTips,not_removed,probably minutesseconds
LifeProTips,not_removed,well whatever still the same question
LifeProTips,not_removed,good point
LifeProTips,not_removed,so people should write out new years resolutions in december and start living it by then
LifeProTips,not_removed,or write deposited on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,or check the back where you countersigned it
LifeProTips,not_removed,or put it in a special folder dedicated to cashed checks instead of tossing it the couch cushions
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know my bank requires me to hold onto the check after i mobile deposit you might want to check that out before you tear them up
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if wanking is the immoral thing i wanted to do
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if youre missing the y chromosome ☹️
LifeProTips,not_removed,do it in a playground and cover all those things at once
LifeProTips,not_removed,ill wank myself when i want to
LifeProTips,not_removed,way to keep it stupid useless lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if you want to wank in public
LifeProTips,not_removed,then wank out of precaution if wanking is still what your heart desires then please wank again
LifeProTips,not_removed,not sure can only speak to what i know
LifeProTips,not_removed,then have yourself a nice jill
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can still have a good wank
LifeProTips,not_removed,im going to regret asking this but how would a wank herself
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats completely unfair to that other person if youre going through a nontrivial breakup that has you thinking about your ex all the time youre rebounding and unstable as hell and its extremely likely that youre going to completely screw things up with the next person in line much better to give things the time they need in that case
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is called rebounding definitely dont do this if youre going through a tough break up experience the pain and learn to be alone for awhile shehe sucked anyway and in the end youre better for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think thats great advice a better strategy is go learn how to do something interesting take a wine or beer making class or a cooking class or volunteer with habitat for humanity and learn building skills do interesting things and youll meet interesting people
LifeProTips,not_removed,the direction is still to move into another relationship which sounds like replace the attachment rather than emotionally recover on your own if someone wants to meet someone new okay but not as a means to get overunattached from someone
LifeProTips,not_removed,shaveall your hair head chest arms and legs hair is an incredibly good insulator in hot weather a cold wet bandana on a bald head gives me goosebumps look at females theyre hairless and always coldthey have little arm hair no chest or back hairalso wear loose clothing to let air circulateseriously go bald wet bandanasit works
LifeProTips,not_removed,get a bandana and constantly put it in the cooler that im gessing you have if you dont have a cooler you should get one ice is only a few buck for ten pounds you can wrap it around your head or cover your head with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,idk if you have one but they have insulated water bottles that keep drinks cold all day is an example of one
LifeProTips,not_removed,breathable clothing should help i dont know if there are any restrictions on what clothing you can have with your work for safety reasons but under armour is a pretty reliable brand the problem i find with keeping cool is the balance between airing out my body to keep cool and keeping the sun off my body i get a lot of face swear so a baseball cap keeps the sun of my face and helps with that but that also makes my scalp sweat a bit more its a compromise lightweight and breathable shoes also help but again i dont know if you have any work restrictions there
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont live in florida oh wait
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you have a military surplus nearby try some summer weight camo pants the thigh pockets can be useful for work as well avoid dark tshirt colors they make cooling vests but ive never been fond of them other than that drink plenty of liquids a half gallon water cooler filled with the rest ice will last most of the day
LifeProTips,not_removed,fly to antartica
LifeProTips,not_removed,you did not specifically mention this as i guess for you it goes without saying but if the op is uncomfortable with shaving all start with your armpits and a very short hair cut
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my experience ice works the opposite way it is much easier on the body to drink more or less room temperature water
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks ill definitely try this out
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah right now i have a little dollar store gallon cooler that works okay for the more mild days but its no match for the summer days ill be looking into a better one like the one youve linked thanks for the input
LifeProTips,not_removed,under armour should be usable for the job unfortunately theyve limited us to steel toe boots only i use a ball cap throughout the day and it does get pretty sweaty but like you said it keeps the sun off my face beggars cant be choosers i suppose thank you for the tips
LifeProTips,not_removed,ice water
LifeProTips,not_removed,you should also try to get a bigger brim hat to get the sun off of your head completely something like a safari explorer wears
LifeProTips,not_removed,that doesnt fit in with my full size candy bars thats right im that house
LifeProTips,not_removed,or hand out the candy so the kids arent able to grab more than you want them to
LifeProTips,not_removed,but you shouldnt give toddlers gum at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,id be worried that a toddler gets hold of the gum and chokes on it didnt give my kids gum until they were teens because they get it everywhere on the car seatsin their hair and on the carpet
LifeProTips,not_removed,also fortune cookies kids in my neighborhood went nuts when we had fortune cookies in our candy bowl individually wrapped please
LifeProTips,not_removed,you sir are a scholar and a saint
LifeProTips,not_removed,you stud
LifeProTips,not_removed,it seems like the percentage of people who say they gave out full size candy bars and the percentage of houses that actually do dont quite match up
LifeProTips,not_removed,why would he be worried about that ensuring a toddler isnt eating gum is definitely a function of their parents
LifeProTips,not_removed,httpiimgurcompqsqjdsjpg
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you have the time you can do what my mum used to do put it in bags she always used to get some different kinds of candy and put one piece of each in a bag and every kid got a bag and then kids stopped doing halloween in our neighborhood
LifeProTips,not_removed,why wouldnt you be worried about a young child choking to death just because its not yours i guess you dont have kids of your own this is how accidents happen
LifeProTips,not_removed,in what fantasy is a toddler walking around unsupervised trick or treating and eating gum stop trying to helicopter parent other peoples kids i have kids and i wish people like you would mind your own business because you are most likely overbearing and raising special snowflakes
LifeProTips,not_removed,its got nothing to do with parenting style and everything to do with giving a choking hazard to young childrenhalloween is hectic accidents happen are you retarded
LifeProTips,not_removed,listen if halloween is too hectic for you to monitor what candy your toddler is eating do the world a favour and surrender them to somebody who doesnt suck at parenting its your job to ensure your kids dont eat gum
LifeProTips,not_removed,what is your problem im saying be careful handing out gum when there are toddlers dipping into the same bowl you say you have kids but you dont acknowledge that toddlers put stuff in their mouth that theyre not supposed toget realas soon as i saw gum and toddler in the same sentence alarm bells rangmy kids are and so i must have done something right without giving them up for adoption as you suggest i think you just enjoy arguing
LifeProTips,not_removed,no im just sick of people trying to tell other people how to raise kids ill make sure my kids dont choke on gum you worry about your life these days i cant give my son juice without some nosey bastard stepping out from the crowd and telling me i shouldnt give him sugar
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow both of your children reached adultage you must be a really solid parent
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not telling anyone how to raise their kidsim saying be careful handing out gum when little kids could possibly end up eating iti really dont get how you turn that into a negative pointi dont really care how you raise your kids i just wouldnt want to be personally responsible for a child choking
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was being told to surrender my kids to adoption as i suck at parenting because i suggested being cautious with gum and toddlershow are you supposed to respond to this apart from say my kids are good thankswierdo
LifeProTips,not_removed,my point is if a young child grabs gum from a bowl of candy then chokes on it while trick or treating its not anybodys fault but their parents and by the way this almost never happens the odds of the toddler dying from being hit by a car is astronomically higher
LifeProTips,not_removed,s
LifeProTips,not_removed,buzzjimsky you stated you disagreed with the lpt and why fine cool no troubles move along observe whatever but then you went on and continued to reiterate your stance over five times after that why state your peace and get over it because chances are you most likely are not going to convince a random stranger on reddit to change their stance and agree with your oppositional albeit fundamental belief just as they likely wouldnt be able to suddenly persuade you to question your logicbeliefs realize that your beliefs are actually wrong and then accept new information as the truthstandard if you dont think you could be swayed by a rando online to not care about what might happen if a toddler took gum from you when you knowingly admit they could potentially choke and die indirectly because of you odds are you cant convince them to change their minds either so drop it now i ask that you kindly refrain from this thread if you do not have anything new insightful and contributional to progress the conversation in a way that you havent already done
LifeProTips,not_removed,so youre going withit probably wont happen and if it does its not my problem coolim out
LifeProTips,not_removed,absolutely
LifeProTips,not_removed,pretty much this guy is like lpt dont plant trees because they might fall on a child in the distant future
LifeProTips,not_removed,the irony is kids have never in the history of man been safer than they are right now i dont understand why people are so hysterical about everything
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you need to twist what i said that much to make your point your obviously wrong gum and toddlers is a bad mix how is this statement wrong and why would it offend you
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont park on the wrong side of the road
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont talk about weight loss body shape or dieting with them dont mention their weight not even to compliment them dont question them when they go to the bathroom sometimes they gotta pee too ya know dont make it weird and as someone else mentioned dont ask a bunch of specific questions no one wants to talk about howwhenetc it isnt fun for anyone and i dont want to make assumptions about your friend but most people are ashamed or embarrassed to talk about their illness
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was close with a person who had this she explained it to me years later she said she never let anyone know and hid her vomiting and could do it in such a way that no one else could know so probably normal conversation nonjudgmental and close friendship kindness and acceptance as a person could be a good start dont ask questions about specific things
LifeProTips,not_removed,compliment them on anything but their appearance their personality kindness humor skills talents vocabulary warmth compassion intelligence energy reliability aesthetic ect take a little time to let them know youre glad theyre around with a hey its good to have you its the little things that people hold onto that make people feel that wild hunger to start getting better remind them that recovery has no destination and is not linear you never finish getting better but at the same time you never stop getting stronger
LifeProTips,not_removed,like everyone else has said dont ever comment on their appearance instead focusing on other aspects that makes them great however id also like to add that subtlety is key in helping them if you see any signs of them doing unhealthy things perhaps help them by scheduling times to hang out text talk whatever dont necessarily confront or excessively compliment thema lot of bulimics really appreciate the unspoken kind of support as well source i am a recovering bulimic
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like that you mention not even to compliment them obviously its not good to compliment someone with bulimia when theyre losing weightbut it can be harmful when you compliment someone on their weight gain when theyre in recovery too especially if youre not terribly close to this person
LifeProTips,not_removed,this let them initiate all conversations about their illness also
LifeProTips,not_removed,a e s t h e t h i c
LifeProTips,not_removed,woah these are good
LifeProTips,not_removed,removed not a lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,im good enough im smart enough and doggoneit people like me
LifeProTips,not_removed,i love the this video i hope i can be that man for my children and others have a great life
LifeProTips,not_removed,i believe in a thing called love
LifeProTips,not_removed,some machines do this many dont many will return the exact coins you inserted if you did not make a purchase
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt this tip is bullshit
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres also a setting inside the machine called forced vend that they can turn on so youd just end up having to buying a drink
LifeProTips,not_removed,many machines will return what you have deposited as it is held temporarily until you make a selection these systems prevent people from treating machines like change machines as you have described
LifeProTips,not_removed,shittiest lpt ever
LifeProTips,not_removed,you hope you get it back all too often i get sfa
LifeProTips,not_removed,some machines wont return change unless you make a purchase
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive tried this when trying to get change for a dollar and it used to work with the coke machine until it started just giving the dollar back now i put the dollar in the snack machine next to me which gives me a dollar coin then i put the dollar coin in the coke machine and finally get my quarters though if im buying something from the coke machine anyway ill usually toss in all my coins and then let the machine consolidate the change for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,many poorlymaintained old vending machines can give you wrong change force you to make a purchase or straight up steal your money would not recommend this lpt
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like this idea but most vending machines i know like to steal my money as is on a larger scale operation i would take quite a few hits
LifeProTips,not_removed,why would you need quarters instead of dimes or nickles
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats what ive always had happen
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive yet to experience this in the past years
LifeProTips,not_removed,laundry carwash gambling in the quarter slots who knows
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you select the drink before inserting payment itll tell you the price or itll tell you sold out
LifeProTips,not_removed,soda machine
LifeProTips,not_removed,not original person but not always had machine that had options i could choose from but are usually sold out thinking ahead before i put my money in i hit all the machine told me the price for each happy i put in my money only for all to tell me sold out as soon as i hit them

LifeProTips,not_removed,no one checks their voicemail anymore

LifeProTips,not_removed,shittiest lpt in a minute
LifeProTips,not_removed,people still leave voicemail
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont use voicemail text or email are better options
LifeProTips,not_removed,missed call notifications go away voice mail takes too long to log in and bullshit through automated menus but texting is the quickest and fastest method to access and respond and isnt deleted without purposeful actions
LifeProTips,not_removed,call someone if you immediately need them otherwise shoot em a text
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt grow up and call people back who called you
LifeProTips,not_removed,who leaves voicemails anymore
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck that delete the number

LifeProTips,not_removed,voicemail what decade are you living in grandma
LifeProTips,not_removed,my voicemails confirm this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dobut only bc the notification wont go away until i do annoying
LifeProTips,not_removed,perhaps not privately but among professional contacts its very much a thing at least here in western europe texting isnt really done in a business context and it is mildly annoying to find a bunch of missed calls without knowing what theyre about just keep it concise good afternoon airfoil speaking i was hoping to discuss the naca with you could you please call me back at your earliest convenience my number is thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,maybe its a home phone
LifeProTips,not_removed,im sure this sub posts more than once a minute
LifeProTips,not_removed,let it fill up mine says its full if you call it i only get the missed call icon
LifeProTips,not_removed,people that usually also text me should know that its not a landline
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone that has had to make calls to people for work you are literally satan
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hate to be that asshole but the other option is you move youre hand around when you add the spices i havent worked in any fancy places but its what happens at the restaurants ive worked at
LifeProTips,not_removed,how high is high enough
LifeProTips,not_removed,reminds me of the bit roseanne barr does about vanna whites beauty tips letting the shower wash your teeth or something who in the hell dumps a spoonful of spice on their food
LifeProTips,not_removed,i get paid to salt fries can confirm
LifeProTips,not_removed,only two comments but they made my night
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres no seasoning wheres the lamb sauce
LifeProTips,not_removed,you have to be kidding me
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre not an asshole theres an abundance of common thinking pro tips but this one takes the cake
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah that works but the real point is just dont dump your seasoning into one pile
LifeProTips,not_removed,lmao im ded
LifeProTips,not_removed,i use a step ladder
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought meant how stoned is this mofo
LifeProTips,not_removed,how old were you when you finally figured this one out i think top ramen is the only thing ive ever dumped my spice into and that was because the water was at a roiling boil and took care of dispersing said spice
LifeProTips,not_removed,got me
LifeProTips,not_removed,spicer is that you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always just cover the top with either a lid or basically anything the flame suffocates and the smoke eventually dissipates then remove the lid
LifeProTips,not_removed,instructions unclear holding burning chopsticks in one hand and phone in the other
LifeProTips,not_removed,or be a fucking badass lick your fingers and pinch that puny flame out of existance
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like the smell of candle smoke to me its part of the whole candle experience
LifeProTips,not_removed,definitely another method i used to use do have a wait a bit before taking the lid back off however
LifeProTips,not_removed,this was my goto but it still smokes
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol doesnt even take a badass to do this just a person whos not a total pussy it would take like seconds of direct contact with a candle flame to even cause a burn
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is very interesting some people cant stand it for me it is the smell of gasl love it but some detest it
LifeProTips,not_removed,if im not feeling too lazy to do so sometimes ill just carry it outside for a few seconds
LifeProTips,not_removed,more spit
LifeProTips,not_removed,hold it for a good ten secs
LifeProTips,not_removed,you callin me out bro
LifeProTips,not_removed,i like em all gasespecially a stroke boat motors smell amazing sulphur from wooden matches candle smoke i grew up camping so a lot of them are like nostalgia smells to me burnt toast too
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wish i liked the smell
LifeProTips,not_removed,the smell of gas is awesome to me i love going to any gas station they smell awesomethe outside where the gas is not the inside
LifeProTips,not_removed,inever thought to do that good point
LifeProTips,not_removed,sure im up for a tussle
LifeProTips,not_removed,it really is getting crazy sometimes i feel like they make things entirely too complex just to show off how complicated they can make something i feel like most people dont even know how to use a portion of the features on their vehicles there are talks of bose for the nose smell cancelling devices to be installed how about just clean it every so often that could work
LifeProTips,not_removed,╭∩╮╭∩╮ come at me bro
LifeProTips,not_removed,ha were in dire need a rube goldberg machine for candle extinguishment
LifeProTips,not_removed,havent enough bros cummed on you already

LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant get enough bro
LifeProTips,not_removed,too late just overnighted a highpowered vacuum from amazon
LifeProTips,not_removed,you owned that like a champ i felt bad and was gonna walk it back instead ill give you the victory
LifeProTips,not_removed,but vacuums have exhausts the smoke would go right through the filter and into the room anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks bro till next time
LifeProTips,not_removed,hence the high power gotta lower the ppm the solution to pollution is dilution
LifeProTips,not_removed,cheers bud
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh mylanta youre a genius we can solve the polluted air problem of the world we will be famous
LifeProTips,not_removed,this applies to females as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt if she says dont use a condom dont have sex with her
LifeProTips,not_removed,if your partner insists on not using birth control when you want to proceed on the assumption that they are trying to hurt your interests because they are advice good for all genders dont sleep with people who dont have your interests at heart go home or kick them out and have a good satisfying and riskfree rub instead
LifeProTips,not_removed,woah never thought about this thanks what a tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless you know she is allergic to latex or gets friction burns how about dont sleep with someone you dont know and cant trust this is why you should chose a fuckbuddy over one night stands
LifeProTips,not_removed,no glove no love
LifeProTips,not_removed,female here has there ever been a woman whos insisted on a guy not wearing one not including the longterm partner here did not think this was a thing among women but what do i know i dont date them edit thank you to everyone who responded definitely something i didnt know
LifeProTips,not_removed,even if she says its love you still need to wear a glove
LifeProTips,not_removed,cartman whats to understand you get a boner slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee kyle stick it inside her and pee cartman well okay fine unless you dont want to get her pregnant then you pull it out and pee on her leg
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont be silly wrap your willy
LifeProTips,not_removed,man everyone should read this tip dont be a fool like me having a wonderful dauther with the worst mother how could i be soo naive i was just man
LifeProTips,not_removed,is this not common sense like someone saying you dont need a lawyer you probably need a lawyer
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah married chick i was with years ago who wasnt on birth control told me to pull out before i came i told her id love to but id wont last that long mostly true right fellas wear a jimmy hat my freinds
LifeProTips,not_removed,if women are requesting it theres definitely something wrong they get max friction with or without a condom as a male though condoms suck its like taking out all the fun and making it a chore let me just fuck you with this dildo
LifeProTips,not_removed,if she says dont wear a condom she wants your future child support payments lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol lmao hahahhahahahaha i will never not say i wont wear one
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for saying this i have walked out of a guys house cause he refused to put one on its a huge turnoff
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the real information not just the tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,in fact run away and dont let the door hit ya this isnt good
LifeProTips,not_removed,play it safe and stay a virgin forever
LifeProTips,not_removed,is that sarcasm
LifeProTips,not_removed,latexfree condoms exist
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah maybe im old fashioned but fucking someone you dont knowtrust well enough for an honest conversation about disease screening and birth control is a really bad idea imo
LifeProTips,not_removed,its probably less common than the guy being the one wanting to ditch the condom but yeah it happens edit typo
LifeProTips,not_removed,quite often actually in my experience its about
LifeProTips,not_removed,youd be surprised
LifeProTips,not_removed,happened to me the other day it is a thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes but not sure it applies directly as wed slept together a couple of times at that point w protection obvs id certainly be surprised concerned if it was requested on the first time although as an idiot youngster back in the i had my share of irresponsible condomless dalliances
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have two neices and a nephew who were accidents i dont understand how people can be so stupid and careless
LifeProTips,not_removed,lawl
LifeProTips,not_removed,by the time she hits party age you could still be in your party age party with your daughter thats kinda cool
LifeProTips,not_removed,and so will your genitals if you dont use one
LifeProTips,not_removed,not necessarily its not uncommon for condoms to make women drier
LifeProTips,not_removed,and here folks we see the elusive triple negative in nature quite a remarkable sight you made my head hurt with this comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,if he even seems reluctant to put on a condom i plan on getting out of there i heard a story about some guy who kept complaining about having to use a condom and took it off in the middle of sex without telling her and now im paranoid about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had a dumb friend who told me well he said its uncomfortable to wear and he refused to wear one like wtf they come in multiple sizes ffs
LifeProTips,not_removed,not just the tip ayyyye
LifeProTips,not_removed,op got to the root of the std problem
LifeProTips,not_removed,til
LifeProTips,not_removed,no s
LifeProTips,not_removed,not to worry maam i carry a wide selection of the finest condoms with me all the time if you prefer the nonlatex kind i can offer three thicknesses seven textures four kinds of lubrication and unflavored strawberry or bananaflavor please check this handy flowchart for available combinations or i can offer you todays pick we would start with a classic extrathin banana flavor for fellatio spice things up with icyhot medium thickness ribbed and finally go anal with extra strong extra lubricated and nobs
LifeProTips,not_removed,good idea
LifeProTips,not_removed,she better be buying that shits expensive and hard to find
LifeProTips,not_removed,well exactly
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok but condoms do fail sometimes they have a high rate of success but not between that and user error accidents can happen

LifeProTips,not_removed,no kidding i understood about of that title
LifeProTips,not_removed,more than me
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is known as the mendelssohn manoeuvre its rather hard to do and you could probably just move your skin to the side easier
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh thanks that is exactly what i had difficuties to shave
LifeProTips,not_removed,okay now what about the giant asscrack of a chin i have
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can move it up and down without swallowing hard to explain how to do though
LifeProTips,not_removed,i read this as shave down your adams apple and thought it was a pro tip for transgenders to get rid of their adams apple without surgery holy moly
LifeProTips,not_removed,before i up or down vote is there anyone who has ever had trouble with this
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a speech pathologist explaining how to do it is extremely difficult so i say initiate a swallow push your tongue tipbody against your top front teethhard palate hold it for seconds and release
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i have a huge phobia of my adams apple but i just pull the skin to the side and shave
LifeProTips,not_removed,you gotta spread those cheeks
LifeProTips,not_removed,i do it by raising the rear of my tongue to touch the roof of my mouth
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup umonsieurvivi above you apparently
LifeProTips,not_removed,fellow speech path always a challenge outside of using semg

LifeProTips,not_removed,but as we know in the real worldhttpiimgurcomaqzhygif
LifeProTips,not_removed,he means his taint and that weird thing that tightens your balls up like a zipper
LifeProTips,not_removed,what do you want to volunteer for
LifeProTips,not_removed,start at a local museum or hospital as they often have hs and college students positions clearing up source hs student
LifeProTips,not_removed,animal shelters big brother big sister find somehing local and close by volunteering in your local neighborhood if possible is best
LifeProTips,not_removed,many cities have a local chapter of the kiwanis club which is involved in charity work and fundraising that varies from city to city if you contact them they could probably find somewhere that could use you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i volunteer at my local humane society and i love it i love animals and im able to volunteer just about any time of the day so that works with my often changing work schedule
LifeProTips,not_removed,how old and what do you like doing if you want to make a year out of it check out americorps great opportunities to spend a year helping your fellow man
LifeProTips,not_removed,you should look up a list of places in your area that need volunteers read up on them and then choose a place with which you connect the most the thing is that you can volunteer anywhere you want but like the saying goes charity begins at home you can actually find people who need help not just in community service places but everywhere around you while crossing the street riding the bus when you are at work at the gym etc by making other people happy you are helping them live a happier life and therefore your life will be happier too try it out
LifeProTips,not_removed,volunteermatchorg was helpful several years ago when i realized i had enough spare time to give back if i remember correctly it will ask you several questions about your interests and then match you up with organizations in need i got involved with planned parenthood this way good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,identify ways you can help others in your community
LifeProTips,not_removed,remember that volunteering goes both two ways you should get something from it eg happiness satisfaction experience etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,come on man really
LifeProTips,not_removed,no more helpful than many of your comment history posts in fact try insulting strangers less start by recording all the negative shit you say out loud for one week give that a little objective thought you massive lightswitch
LifeProTips,not_removed,your tip is to mark your place in books with bookmarks
LifeProTips,not_removed,no response to your history of negativity shocker dime a dozen know it all
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha if somethings stupid ill call it out i have plenty of positive constructive conversations too
LifeProTips,not_removed,it depends on the context being a southern female it can also be a term of empathy if youre unable to tell in which context it was said then it probably wasnt an empathetic one
LifeProTips,not_removed,gotta listen to the tone if its overly sweet they are insulting you the other ones not so much
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha not necessarily i take it youve met a lot of women that said this as a derogatory phrase where i am from it is only little old ladies taking sympathy on you
LifeProTips,not_removed,well arent you retarded
LifeProTips,not_removed,it is meant to be insulting
LifeProTips,not_removed,not always truethats the beauty behind itsometimes its actually used for sympathy sometimes they are being cunts
LifeProTips,not_removed,bless your heart you stupid fucking idiot
LifeProTips,not_removed,im guessing youre not actually from the south this is not always the case and depends entirely on the context the south isnt like what hollywood portrays
LifeProTips,not_removed,if its an insult its probably in response to something insulting
LifeProTips,not_removed,theres nobody who doesnt know this so fuck right off
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is true for example if she says it with your penis in her mouth its probably not an insult and even if it is who cares
LifeProTips,not_removed,but ill pray for you is pretty much always an insult
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah do declar
LifeProTips,not_removed,aw bless your heart but you seem a bit angry
LifeProTips,not_removed,username checks out eh
LifeProTips,not_removed,so bless your heart its so cute isnt an insult to you

LifeProTips,not_removed,hello uphillmccracken thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons not considered a lpt a tip that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way if you would like to appeal this decision httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetorlifeprotips do not repost without explicit permission from the moderators make sure you rlifeprotipsaboutsidebar before submitting thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,its more likely that what ever email service youre using just got better at filtering out the emails
LifeProTips,not_removed,most likely marking a email as spam on gmail will help it detect it as spam next time you will a free iphone
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont thats a crapton of work just to report every piece of spam just reportbloack it on gmail and get over with it why go to legitimate websites and show them at least for every occasion
LifeProTips,not_removed,please youtube the proper methods to safely fail a rep dont just guess and risk injuring yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is why we squat in a fucking power rack and use a spotter on bench press problem solved
LifeProTips,not_removed,why the fuck would you try to roll the bar down your chest i dont even lift and i know thats a good way to break your ribs or crush something important
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes do that and one probably does not want to try out with weights around
LifeProTips,not_removed,power rack does not matter one should still know what to expect and spotting bros are not always around caveat if one squats kg then it will not be easy to get the bar off and it could be dangerous to try in very heavy cases one will need a spotter or three of them but such guys are experienced and already know all of this
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are doing light to medium weight then this is the preferred method you actually want to guide the bar down to your abs instead of setting on the chest though then sit up and roll it to your thighs and slide your feet out
LifeProTips,not_removed,my reasoning was that sliding the bar off the chest is better than leaving it there
LifeProTips,not_removed,no matter the weight or circumstance you are limiting the risk of injuring yourself and or others by using a power rack on squats and a spotter when benching there are so many things that could go wrong during the process respect yourself and your environment simple as that
LifeProTips,not_removed,difficult to get the bar off you can always lift more off the rack than you can actually squat thats why squat walkouts exist the only time this is not the case is if you leave the rack high enough that you have to tiptoe it off which is utterly idiotic
LifeProTips,not_removed,i always thought it would make more sense to lean the bar to one side of you or the other that way youre only dealing with half the total weight of what you have on the bar and can leverage it off of you easier of course a spotter would be nice too
LifeProTips,not_removed,ideally yes but safety training is not there to cover the ideal circumstances i work out at am i dont have time otherwise ideally someone would spot me but thats not the case the only other person at the gym is doing cardio upstairs
LifeProTips,not_removed,definitely agree that safety training is important obviously dont do it on your own lol also i know its common sense but its always best to have a spotter or a saftey mechanism in place if you do have any doubt in your mind that you might fail in the middle of your set just do lighter weight and a higher rep count again all common sense but some people never learn and it ends up costing them alot more than they could have ever gained
LifeProTips,not_removed,i test them by peeing when i first put the condom on if no pee shoots out i know im good to go
LifeProTips,not_removed,life pro tip dont leave condoms in your wallet it ruins them
LifeProTips,not_removed,this only tests whether the packaging is still sealed it discovers nothing about the condom that thing could be riddled with holes in there could have ants we dont know
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt blow it up first
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt if questionable and shes tested and your girl nail her in the butt
LifeProTips,not_removed,who the fuck tampers with unopened condoms
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is often referred to as the pillow test edit i wonder if folks thought i was joking poorly i learned it in my highschool health class google condom pillow test
LifeProTips,not_removed,unless you are into piss fetish ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think thats very good for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had to read that a few times to get it
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt if your condom has ants you can safely wash them off with bleach and also your penis
LifeProTips,not_removed,university was passing out condoms with a message stapled to the package
LifeProTips,not_removed,it only literally takes a second and youre not going out of your way so i dont see how it can hurt say you meet some random girl and you hit it off you go back to her place and she hands you a condom i dont think its reasonable to put trust in someone you know nothing about of course the chances are low that someone would intentionally put holes in a condom but it has happened
LifeProTips,not_removed,a couple months ago there was a story in relationships were a guy poked holes into condoms so her could get his girlfriend of months pregnant i forget what his reason was but it was super creepy
LifeProTips,not_removed,some people are disgusting and try to trick partners into pregnancy both men and women so dont get all sexist only blaming men please do this also sometimes abusive people do it
LifeProTips,not_removed,it can happen unintentionally but to answer your question crazy girlfriends crazy exgirlfriends youtube pranksters etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is a terrifying lenny
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think thats very good for your partner either
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats like next level stupidity how could not even one person think hey stapling them may not be a good idea
LifeProTips,not_removed,always bring your own you know where its been you know it will fit and you know its not tampered with heat pressure and time all wreck condoms
LifeProTips,not_removed,why would she give you a broken condom
LifeProTips,not_removed,he wanted to enjoy the healthy combination of restraining order and lifetime child support
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats how my bestie got a baby fucking creeps
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not just celebrities there are some really disgusting pieces of shit out there
LifeProTips,not_removed,well the good news is the girlfriend broke up with him and got an abortion
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes and not just women either men tamper with birth control as well if theyre trying to force someone into a relationship
LifeProTips,not_removed,also please follow the rules of the gym im already tired of mopping up other peoples sweat off machines because they havent brought a towel
LifeProTips,not_removed,posting pictures at the gym with the caption on that grind does not make you stronger in fact it makes you look stupid dont be that guy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i really hate those kinds of websites some are practicvally impossible to read on a smartphone and dont get me started on news articles barred behind a register window
LifeProTips,not_removed,what if you want both
LifeProTips,not_removed,or at least dont talk to anyone afterwards
LifeProTips,not_removed,the best thing i heard when my parents were separating was that divorce turns parents into children and children into parents as time went on it became painfully true for my siblings and i there is no graceful way of navigating this your parents have no idea what theyre doing either be patient with them and yourself and take solace that youll all get through it and be stronger for it if you have siblings stay close to them im much closer to mine now that weve had to deal with our parents being children good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,be prepared for unexpected anger that has nothing to do with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would recommend seeking counseling if you are able my parents just finalized their divorce similar length of marriage and i am i wish i had been seeing a counselor over the last year because i have been quite depressed and gained a lot of weight etc some guidance would have helped as for your home i can relate completely my mother is putting our house on the market in may i have lived there since i was four i asked my siblings if they would like to make a video with me going room to room and talking about some memories we have for each part of the house i think that will help us to appreciate the house and cope with losing it you dont necessarily have to do that as it is going to be timeconsuming but taking some time to appreciate your home for what is has been and talking to someone about it may allow you to transition i would also recommend trying to avoid becoming the person your parents vent to about the situation a divorce is easier if you are able to continue your relationship amicably with both parents my father had an affair and while i dont approve at all it is extremely draining and difficult to listen to my mother talk about it which she does because she is very hurt your parents may or may not do this but if they do sit down and have a very calm and civil conversation that shows how this affects you make it clear that you understand why they are turning to you but recommend other resources that would be more appropriate and allow you each to heal more easily my sister is currently and living at home with our mother she spends time separately with each parent and tries to encourage my mother to get out of the house and do things so dont get stuck in a rut keep engaging in life and keep a routine even if its hard what are some things you do now that you can keep doing as you move etc do you take a warm bath before bed do you start the day with some yoga do you take an hour to relax after school before beginning homework find normalcy where you can push yourself to engage in your life its hard to do when you are depressed and having trouble coping but you have to make yourself do it good luck im sorry this is happening to you and i know it feels like it will never be okay again but it will
LifeProTips,not_removed,do not cope with drugs i thought was i was just experimenting and being a teenager i didnt even realize what was happening until it was far too late i had no idea how much emotional pain was buried talk about your feelings feel them allow them to be allow everything to be it will all be ok
LifeProTips,not_removed,just breath remeber that your parents arent mythical theyre people who are complex and flawed they arent happy with their current life and deserve to be this doesnt have any thing to do with you its just them living their lives
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents seperated and began the divorce process when i was it wasnt official until i was it was a very ugly divorce i hope that its civil and they dont involve you in anything that you needent be concerned keep your head up and find some close people to talk to and if you want please feel free to pm me and ill help if i can good luck and keep your head high
LifeProTips,not_removed,from the other side of things im a family law attorney so i see what happens in private here are a few thoughts whatever relationship you had with both your parents is still in tact sometimes people will try to play games and youll be stuck in the middle but however your mom and dad felt about you before all this is still there and will be after its over its more about them than you so remember youre still loved it can take a year or more to finalize a contested divorce if this is your case so be prepared for things to go on for a while depending on your age there could be hearings about custody visitation support etc depending on circumstances you may meet with lawyers or support services you also may be called to testify to the court about things like where you want to live what things were like etc just be cool and tell the truth it might be tough but above all else just tell people how you feel the process can cause kids to grow up fast but there are plenty of people out there willing to help in the process i dont know your exact circumstances but if you have any questions pm me i might be able to help out a bit
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont let either of them play you for a fool just cut them off when they start talking about the other parent even if theyre trying to open up to you you need to set some healthy boundaries because even if it comes from a good place theyre going to say some awful things about each other anytime you hear a sentence start with your motherfather just tune it out parents can be suuuuper petty over the smallest things its unbelievable
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok heres the thing my parents divorced after years when i was we ended up moving out of the house and i switched homes between mom and dad every week until i moved to college my mom became a serious asshole after the divorce and we dont talk anymore but ive never been closer to my dad than i am now a lot of this has to do with finances though after selling our old house we were able to pay off every debt and now my parents individually make a ton of money my life got a lot better after the divorce honestly but your situation might be different there is no one answer for how to deal with it the changes are going to fly at you fast and i suggest you roll with the punches go with the flow everyone in your family will be going through their own thing if you have siblings stick with them but most of all keep your head up it might feel like the world is ending and it is but something new is just starting go in with an open mind and see where it goes
LifeProTips,not_removed,they both still love you
LifeProTips,not_removed,full disclosure im married parent of and my parents got a divorce when i was it is not your fault even if they say so in anger you are not responsible for their happiness and this is a fact many parents dont understand they will feel guilty it will show in their behaviour they will act weird remember that they are coping with this too and that their acting weird is not because of you they are human and capable of all the awkward bullshit you have to deal with it will be weird you have to deal with a new normal and it is completely alien to what you have had your entire life talk it out but never praise one parent more than the other barring completely ass hole behaviour from one of them they feel guilty and you can make it worse by telling them you prefer one house over another you will spend more of your time in transition between your two parents homes account for this in your activities and homework this means less video games or whatever leisure time you have remember that a lot of kids grades suffer during a divorce and this is one of the reasons beat the average its the best advice you can easily pull off talk to people about it you are not the first and you are not alone there is no shame in having feelings and it doesnt matter if its anger or depression or elation my parents got divorced and i immediately got grounded half as much i felt bad for feeling good about it but it took me a long time to realize that this is normal and acceptable if hanging out at a parents place is dull or boring then find something to do together make the hours you have together worth it and they wont feel even worse about things and overcompensate eating up more off everyones time even if its a stupid puzzle or basketball outside or hiking anything together is better than two people on their phones for hours awkwardly having stop and go conversations
LifeProTips,not_removed,parents often dont have a proper support system in place while divorcing so they inadvertently lean on their children for backup its a really selfish move even if they dont realize it its ok to set boundaries and let your parents know that you wont be put in the middle or be forced to choose sides youre still their child not their peer
LifeProTips,not_removed,always remember you have an opinion i was told by my father to always tell your mother what she wants to hear and today im a people pleaser who cant talk about emotions or opinions dont hold back what ya think
LifeProTips,not_removed,try to separate your individual relationships with your parents from the divorce process itself and focus on the positive attributes from each of them also i found it to be helpful to not minimize my emotions and talk with a therapist about them even if they seem irrational or overly angry or stupid anyone can give you advice but you will be the one person making the unique journey that is your life postdivorce and figuring out how you are going to react to this lifechange bringing people in on that journey and being completely open with them would do some good try not to give up favorite hobbies or activities that you used to enjoy with a parent but now may resent continue setting boundaries and making what you want to do known which can be hard with court papers expect to cry a lot throw things want to run away be rebellious become more empathetic to others grow stronger and more humble you may develop a really strong bond with the more stable and more emotionally available parent whereas the other is merely a penpal sort of relationship i could keep rambling but i guess the most important thing is that its not your fault in anyway and that your parents love you
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont be afraid my story is a bit different than most i thought i had a great relationship with my dad i loved him and my mother with all my heart then out of the blue my dad left my mom sister and i when i was and my sister was we were all devastated he did the whole go out for cigarettes and never come back sort of thing only he forgot to leave us when my sister and i were too young to remember him i guess in the first few months that he was gone he would have me or my sister over to his house to visit he was always mean to us when we were there he would try to tell us blatant lies about our mom and try to make it sound like she was so mean since we lived with our mom still we knew things he said was a lie we could see her crying every night and how upset she was anyway back to the silver lining part so about a year after my dad left my mom started dateing this guy who was amazing he was so nice to my sister and i he loves us more than our real father ever did he would take time off work to do things with us we could really tell how much he cares for our family it was mind boggling we thought we had a good father our whole life but this man my mom started dateing showed us how terrible our real father had been his whole life all our real father cared about was working overtime so he could make money for him self to buy things he wanted our real father didnt care at all about our family fast forward my mom and her new husband have been together years im now my sister is i havent talked to my real father in years i now call my moms new husband dad and so does my sister not because he ever asked us to but we chose to call him dad on our own i never had a real dad in my life but i realized but now i do the whole experience really showed me how messed up my family had been i can see now how much better my life is without my real dad around us what im trying to say is my story might be one in a million but sometimes things that look horrible at first actually turn out to be a huge blessing i hope everything works out in the end for you also stay together for the kids helped me out for the first few weeks if your into that sorta thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,my cousin shared this bit of advice with me as my parents were parting life has good things and bad things in it what matters is taking the good and the growth from every situaton thats stuck with me for a long while and i hope it helps you
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont pick sides and seek counsellingtherapy if necessary
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents split up when i was in high school was a very challenging time and i allowed myself to sink into bad behavior to cope dont advise this route one of the biggest challenges of a family splitting up is that youre so focused on how it impacts you and your siblings but its bigger than that your parents are doing what they think is best for themselves even if its selfish many of the constructs of what a family should be are founded on traditional depictions tough advice but realize that it happens in of households learn to accept and even embrace reality hope this helps you in your journey
LifeProTips,not_removed,its not your fault its not your fault its not your fault if i said it a thousand times it still wouldnt be enough head up they still love you no matter what some parents try wedging you against the other while this may be selfish they still love you and if they ever make you feel like you have to pick a favorite let them know what theyre doing
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents got divorced when i was or so and honestly it was shit for a while and it was ugly as hell but after it all settles down try to carry on your life because it is your life not your parents hang out with friends do some of your hobbies and all that pretty shitty advice but just dont start doing stupid shit because youll regret it when you become more mature hint i did stupid shit and i regret it now im more mature
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre gonna feel torn and honestly you may even lose respect and trust it isnt your fault talk about your feelings and get help if you need it it isnt weak to ask its only weak to give in be strong for those you need to be for remember that other family members have feelings too and please dont neglect your siblings remember they feel the exact way you do and possibly worse know that it isnt ever gonna be the same but maybe that is for the better and you just have to keep it together as best you can and hold out until it settles down and gets better cause it will ❤
LifeProTips,not_removed,parents divorced mom remarried dad did not im now growing up you realize that its all about being happy instead of feeling depressed think about how much you want them to be happy getting divorced is a huge deal and you should know that its likely been in the works for awhile if anything its you that kept them together for this long and im not saying that like its a good thing there are many marriages out there that know it wont last but they will stick it out so their kids have a normal childhood think about that would you spend years with someone that you dont love anymore just to give your kid a normal childhood until they out of the house personally i wouldnt wish that on anyone it takes a lot of courage to end a marriage support them dont make this harder on them im sorry but this isnt the end of the world embrace and love both your parents they are that much closer to being free from each other and on their path to be happy be happy for them this is a huge step for both of them
LifeProTips,not_removed,establish this boundary early and reinforce it of the time without fail you will not act as a gobetween for your parents and you expect they will not use you against the other trust me they will try and you need to push back tell them what theyre doing is bullshit tell them by doing this they lose credibility as a parent whatever whatever it takes cause it is bullshit you should not have to deal with

LifeProTips,not_removed,hey man ok so just of the bat i was in the exact same situation first things first keep your head up and know that whats about to happen is most likely going to force you to grow up quicker than you might like it happened with me it happened with almost every other person i know that went through this the best thing to do with that factor is learn on it and grow on it your parents at the end of everything are still going to be your parents but in order to make things smoother for yourself youre going to have to force yourself to be self sufficient and thats not a bad thing ultimately think about it this way while they do their own thing the absolute best thing that you can take away from all of this is to take some time for self growth and dont look for substances for a get away whats happening has absolutely nothing to do with you understand that i know it sucks i really do but just understand that this isnt in anyway your fault or your responsibility the absolute best thing for you to do is make the best of the situation at hand and grow from it

LifeProTips,not_removed,this sucks its going to be rough for awhile keeping a journal might help you cope if you can be afforded a therapist that might help even more the truth of life is that it is filled with changes this may be your first but it wont be your last youre obviously computer literate so search for websites and forums to help and support you going through this transition you will be ok hugs from a reddit grandma
LifeProTips,not_removed,this may get downvoted from people that dont believe in the church and thats ok im fine with a negative score if op reads this and if it helps them first off i am so very sorry to hear you are having to go through this my parents were also about to have a divorce but they stayed together in the hopes i would still grow up a christian as they had they knew that children of divorced parents are much more likely to end up in jail on drugs bankruptcy pretty much everything is against them my parents and i both grew up in the church church of christ their plans worked out and i grew up having a somewhat normal life despite my father being depressed all the time i was born a year and a half after my sister passed away in a car accident in so that is where the depression stems from i knew that i had a place in this world my parents were at the edge of divorce because they did argue a lot and both suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression some of that has passed onto me anyway back to where being involved in a church helps right so taking part in church activities and getting to make friends in the church is what kept my parents together and is what has helped me continue on in my own depression being a part of a church family is something that you cant get anywhere else they are there for you in any scenario just like a real family my mother went through knee replacement surgery when i was young and they knew my dad didnt cook so different church families brought us home cooked meals every day until she recovered we didnt even ask them to that is just one random example my point is that if you can find a century church still practices what the bibles says in the century invites everyone inside regardless of race income past mistakes etc you are in good hands so many people despise churches and christians now and i can understand where some of them are coming from being a christian is not putting people down and telling them theyre going to hell for having an abortion being a christian is quite simply living your daily life but with a kind heart doing what you can each day to help people and trying your best to abide by what the bible says sure were human and we make mistakes and thats ok just dont think that its ok to keep making the same mistake over and over again a good church will want to hear your story and help you through this time and years down the road do not let this unfortunate event slow you down you are a very special person and you deserve all the loving hearts you can get i hate to say you will face many more trials in life that will try to break you how you react to them is what will make all the difference many people turn to alcohol drugs porn over eating over spending all kinds of stuff those are ways to put a used bandage on an open wound it will hurt you more later a change of heart that you can get from a church is a very real cure for so many things i have seen it time and time again my friend who almost died in elementary school and had to go through a very serious bone marrow transplant is now our worship leader on sundays my other friend who had his parents split up when he was young and while in college his mother passed away amazingly two years later he switched his major from aeronautical engineering to ministry to become a pastor in order to help others through time in need just as so many people helped him that were members of our church i have dozens of other stories but those are my most memorable sorry i was all over the place in writing this i was mainly speaking from my heart and not paying much attention to paragraph or sentence structure p i hope you can find peace during this time i wish you the best in your future know that if you ever want to reach out to me and ask anything im just a pm away that goes for anyone reading this
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont worry about hurting your parents feelings if you wish to spend time with one of them over the other they should understand that you cannot be in two places at once and if they give you shit about it you should definitely talk to them recognize that your parents have the right to make their own decisions their divorce will probably be better for them in the long run as a broken marriage can only hold on so long try to keep things civil this may be hard to do as you dont want to get in the middle of them they should understand that your happiness comes before any conflict or pettiness theres not much you can do for this one but its definitely something your parents should know get to know your parents as two separate people with very different interests theyre not a unit anymore my parents divorced before i could remember so i didnt go through the initial separation but i know what its like to try to balance your relationships with both of them edit make sure to hang out with some good friends they dont take sides and are great for support or just to escape for a bit

LifeProTips,not_removed,well im a divorced parent my kids arent quite teenagers but i hope that you can get a little help from this your parents still love you bottom line they have probably stayed together way longer than they wanted to just because they wanted to try and give you and your siblings if any a better home you might not have seen the fights and counselling sessions that were date nights or movie nights or whatever else lets assume there was a reason for the divorce it has nothing to do with you so dont worry about why adult relationships end sometimes like yours will from time to time thats a normal part of life when youre married and have kids together its not as easy to just leave so you try to fix stuff but sometimes its broken beyond repair and so your parents who love you remember cant live together anymore in the end i hope your parents move on with their lives and keep you in it a best they can i hope youre not used as a pawn or a weapon in some stupid game but it happens learn to call that parent out on it if it happens good luck kid remember they love you more than their own health and sanity

LifeProTips,not_removed,hey i was years old when my parents got divorced after years of marriage as well it was an extremely ugly divorce and it took my parents years to finally get over every divorce has different circumstances but heres some things i feltlearnt from your parents might drag you in the middle of things edit resist them putting you in the middle dont respond if they start to or say that its between them and not youand be onesided ex your mom will complain about your dad not paying child support your dad will say that he does just know you should never blame yourself and also be aware of asking your parents for proof with onesided arguments ex giving mom a copy of your dads bank statements showing child support payments i always felt bad and i would cry when my mom said that i never visited her enough and when my dad said me going to my moms was betraying him it made me feel like shit and i hated having to pick one or the other initially its just one big tug of war except youre the rope and no one wins its hard but i promise it gets better it will be hard but be patient with your parents they will eventually move on and be accepting and civil towards each other if the divorce was messy if you have siblings this will bring you closer in the end its the one thing im thankful for especially older siblings like uthereallroquefort said parents become children children become parents you will learn to look after and care for each other more since divorced parents become the children dont be afraid of crying it out the statistic that us children have divorced parents or whatever doesnt make your problem any less significant dont feel like youre dumb because youre extremely upset over something half of the nation is going through or whatever dont let it affect your future negatively dont turn to drugs and alcohol excessively at least dont think love is doomed and that you cant have a great marriage learn from your parents mistakes i know my parents always yelled at each other and i learned from them i always raised my voice first in arguments but now ive learned how to communicate issues without being hurtful to another person i love sending you all my love through these tough times you will come out of it with a whole new outlook on life hope all works out in the end
LifeProTips,not_removed,this was my experience not sure if it goes for most people youll be caught in the middle a lot of the time my parents would both portray the other as a terrible person always complaining to me about the other which gave me a lesser opinion of them both realize that your parents will be the same theyve always been most likely happier if a divorce is what they wanted and they arent a horrible person just because thats what the other parent portrayed

LifeProTips,not_removed,remember its not your fault
LifeProTips,not_removed,from my experience the marriage ended badly my mother spent most of my teenage years trying to convince me my father was literally satan my father didnt care and did his own thing my mother remarried and expected me to move away when i was starting high school with all of my friends i moved in with my dad and didnt talk to my mother for about years when i moved out she threatened to kill herself and when i wrestled the knife away from her she called the cops and said i hit her i was almost sent to juvi for assault at because of it which caused me to not speak to my mother for years
LifeProTips,not_removed,in a similar situation my ex and i split after years my oldest is i have a daughter and a son they are still living in the house they grew up in so that helps the biggest change for them was me moving out but im still their dad and love them with all my heart its difficult because you didnt ask for this you dont have an ex you still have and need a mom and dad hopefully youre not pulled into a battle of manipulation and arguing hopefully youre not forced to pick sides if they have problems or discussions they should do it between them and not put you in the middle you also shouldnt tolerate bad mouthing or trash talking the other again you didnt ask for this divorce is tough but so is living in a bad marriage i hope you adjust to the new reality and get to spend lots of time with both parents after almost years my kids have adjusted very well to coming over to me and my girlfriends house its ok to be weird about it when you are asked to meet another so its going to be awkward and thats normal but please remember this is not your fault relationships go bad and moving on takes time i wish you the best of luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,im definitly late to this but my story involves me being the youngest and last one in the house when my parents got the divorce fighting between parents gossip between parents airplane filghts every months between two locations being too young for anyone to talk to so having to figure it out myself amongst deciding which thing my parents said was a lie or the truth all while blaming myself for the divorce due to not understanding anything at the time if you want my story and the advice i can provide with it let me know and ill take the time to write it up but again im probably late to the party and im at work right now long story short everything will work out just remember that its not going to be easy for your parents and this will be a moment in time for you to be stronger than you ever thought you could be and i promise no matter how gray it looks or feels you are that strong
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was an only child whos parents divorced when i was very young or so because my mom decided to basically cheat on my dad however by that time my dad basically knew it was over so it wasnt a surprise transition really the biggest thing is how your parents handle each other luckily my parents actually didnt hate each other until about a decade later but by then i was old enough to deal with it someone else said dont hate your parents because they got divorced i second this i hate my parents but not because they got divorced its because they were really shitty parents growing up my dad dated a sociopath afterwards and my mom is fucking crazy moving from your childhood home shouldnt be too big a thing it seems daunting but a house is a house its not you its not your home home is wherever you want it to be the hardest part of my parents divorce is that again my mom is fucking crazy she has diagnosed mental health issues and they really took their toll on me as a kid and i couldnt really get out it sounds like youre not a child though so that shouldnt be a giant issue my main advice on this front is dont try to fix your parents they got themselves into it and you trying to fix anything or take sides only makes it worse one benefit of divorce is that when you get tired of one parent or if one gets mad at you you can escape to the other again this depends on how your parents deal with each other afterwards divorce can be terrible or it can be not really that bad at all as in my case if its bad make sure you have friends who can support you even if you dont some hobby to take your mind off it does wonders id probably be much worse offdead if i didnt have video games as solace away from my mother just take it a day at a time and think when youre you can go away to college and leave that mess behind for a while

LifeProTips,not_removed,first of all i know it might not seem like it right now but this could very well be the start of a better path for both your parents and yourself there will be tears and fights and a lot of weight on your shoulders to stay in touch with both parties and balance your admiration in much the same way a parent has to avoid prioritising one kid over another but going through something as emotionally charged as this with them will drive you closer to them in a way that you would not have experienced otherwise it will take a lot of maturity on your part and you will almost have to become a parent to them both in that you stay neutral be their ear when they need one remember parents are human beings as well they are going through their own shit be there as a daughter and as a friend and in time things will turn around this could be the start of the best thing thats ever happened to you

LifeProTips,not_removed,ive entered this thread thinking how teens could get married in the first place
LifeProTips,not_removed,you need to know that this isnt necessarily a bad thing you can feel sad for the fact that its over between them but dont wish for them to get back together if they didnt part ways now their resentment could build up to hate with you in the middle my parents had a somewhat bad divorce but im fortunate enough that they never had fights when i was there and neither of them ever badmouthed the other so i never knew it was bad to me i just got another house to stay at and youre a bit older than i was so if youre not this fortunate youre at least old enough to recognize it and speak up if they start badmouthing the other or saying that its the other parents fault tell them i dont want to hear that i still love momdad because this is nobodys fault they ultimately just didnt fit together even if they dont see it that way right now they might in the future
LifeProTips,not_removed,two christmases or hanukkahs im not really sure how that works
LifeProTips,not_removed,get help if your tiredsad unproductive for over weeks dont go months or years like most people look into going to therapy you dont have to be super fucked up to go to therapy everyone deserves some help you also dont have to be embarrassedashamed if you decide to go or look into it and depends on where you live but if you live in australia go to your gp tell them how you are feeling physically and emotionally ask them about your options or to refer you to a psychologist i did this and am now on an antianxietydepression medication which has had no side effects for me and i am feeling great there is also free sessions with a psychologist annually they dont work for everyone though and im also not suggesting to jump on medication if you dont want to or dont feel like you need to put an extra focus on sleep food water and exercise to avoid getting or worsening depression etc try not to get involved in your parents crap but this might be really hard depending on the circumstances if you get sick of your parents telling you stuff set boundaries or tell them i dont need to hear it but also try and be gentle with them when you can this will be a very eye opening time for you because youll probably start realising your parents arent just your parents they are flawed human beings just like everybody else youll notice how selfish immature and annoying they can be but you also might have to carry the burden of being an emotional support for them it depends how comfortable you are with this just know that life doesnt have this set way of being i remember my dad being like i was never meant to get divorced this thinking held him back from moving on and also admitting his faults like shits happened all we can do is make the most of it eg how can i be a better person or what do i actually want out of life you probably dont want to look back and be like wow i wasted all my teen years moping or pushing away my problems and feelings lastly dont forget to grieve if you need to its ok to be sad and need to cry which releases endorphins which will make you feel better or be angry i suggest you get a notebook and write out whats pissing you off or making you sad i know it may sound lame but it will be great to work out how to organise your thoughts so you can heal from it
LifeProTips,not_removed,sucks assmine was super ugly it was pretty much the worst years of my life but just do you and become independentset some goals and make them happen do not be one of those angsty asshats acting dumb and blaming their parents divorce i know i sound kinda cold but life aint easyidk your situation but just keep your head straight
LifeProTips,not_removed,im years old and my parents just got divorced a couple years ago after being married for just a year longer than my lifespan ill say that your parents probably arent going to be handling it rationally they may say things about the other parent that dont make sense out of bitterness they may want you to get onto their side stick with your siblings make sure that everyones feeling okay it doesnt make sense to take sides even if someone is clearly doing something wrong when they ask your opinion make sure to state conservatively what you think and honestly about how you feel for example be frank if you feel like someones not being fair with you but dont ever go on a rant validating someones anger it will just split up the family more its a very volatile time for those feelings of anger so make sure youre not poking at the fire my sister who is younger than me didnt really think enough about it when she would use their divorce to get something out of either parent its totally fair given that she was only at the time and was put into a terrible position but it really fucked my mom up when she would ask my dad for favours and then clearly be more pleased with him as a parent as a result when my mother was just doing what she thought was fair consider that you need to be an adult in this situation its really crucial that you remain fair and try not to involve yourself with the anger between them no matter how peaceful your parents are there will be bitterness and some trouble dont worry about things that arent relevant to you just worry about how everyones holding up also everything will be totally fine your family is not ending its going to be difficult but you can be the catalyst to making it an easy split you can make all the difference in keeping people sane and healthy you will be ok

LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents divorced when i was the key thing that made it ok for me was understanding it was not about me it had nothing to do with me this was their lives and they were unhappy together and they needed to make this change and it simply wasnt about me at all i know it sounds simple but if you just keep telling yourself that it makes everything else easier everything else is just them figuring out how to deal with their lives changing so radically after years of marriage one other thing dont allow them to make it about you your life is your life and it has nothing to do with their divorce if they start trying to drag you into it simply say this is between you two its not about me and you concentrate on your life and adjusting as best you can honestly as a teenager you were going to move out of the house in a few years anyway so your focus is on making sure you are prepared to take care of yourself and growing your dreams
LifeProTips,not_removed,find someonesomething to keep you grounded truly grounded my parents divorced two years before i left for college and all that suppressed anger and stress really screwed me over my first few years there dont be afraid to ask your parents questions and realize that they can be biased like anybody else and that theyre having a rough time too ask for support when you truly need it i procrastinated my entire way through five years of oncampus college and didnt realize until just last year that ive been subconsciously blaming everything on my father i called him after years of no contact and rekindled with him instantly and im even tearing up just typing this because of how relieved i was to hear his voice on the other end dont make that mistake relationships will feel strained at certain points but dont lose touch youll make it
LifeProTips,not_removed,dealing with divorce as a teenager is different than as a younger child because you have more of a choice in how you deal with it my parents divorced during the summer before high school started i was going through my own changes in life like switching schools making new friends and more challenging work at school i decided that i would just take pretend it wasnt happening i hated being in the middle of my parents arguments so i would try to stay away from home as much as possible i always knew that i would stay with my mom when i was young she used to force me to take her side in arguments as a teenager i would literally walk away if she started talking about my father even when we had move away from our family house i barely helped out in the packing and moving process i would stay over at my friends houses as much as i could looking back i was dealing with it in the only way i thought i could but i hurt my mom in the process because i wasnt there for her when she needed help i dont think our situations were similar because you seem to be blindsided by your parents decisions all i can say is that time makes everything better things will be different but its necessary for your parents happiness i do suggest that you try to be there for both your mom and dad when they really need it but take time to do things that make you happy and maybe find productive activities that will get you out of the house
LifeProTips,not_removed,thankfully my parents didnt get divorced and worked things out in the end but they got separated and almost did at one point one way i dealt with it i found an outlet for my emotions video games books and art something to just get away from reality for a bit and to calm down it can be very stressful so having that outlet is very important
LifeProTips,not_removed,you need to know that this may sound cliche but its not your fault one of them might even be so stupid as to say this is all your fault but its not you also need to grieve grieving is not only about death it is for loss you are losing a lot and grieving is important
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not sure how your bad your parents divorce will be but if it turns bad and they cant decide on custody you may have to choose a parent to live with in court try to talk to them and get them to understand that custody is a terrible idea for you and your mental and emotional health try to get them to agree on something where the parent who you arent living with can see you whenever you want not the other way around this way you arent forced into a crappy hour or two at inconvenient times also having them there when you need them is important too i know it will be tough to get them to agree to that but it really is the best thing for you my parents divorce wasnt too bad so they decided on that themselves and i cant tell you how nice it was to be able to have my dad around when i needed him or i could just see him for lunch on weekends and stuff in the long run the worst thing youll have to deal with is trying to decide who to see on holidays like thanksgiving or christmas the upside is birthdays just know it gets better and once they let their relationship heal and you grow up a little more itll seem like a normal life
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents recently got divorced obviously dont pick sides but if one of them starts name calling and blatantly lying to you about the other distance yourself from them a little remember this is about them not you at the end of it you can only hope both of them will be happier if they start using you as a pawn thats unacceptable if they try to make you pick sides thats worse my dad barely speaks to me i dont really mind now because im fairly used to it but he told me my mum was malicious and a liar both of which i believe to not be true but it was one of those im sorry i have to ask because i cant forget about it im glad i did my mum showed me the original court order and subsequent orders from followups at the end of the day this is both of them trying to be happy support them as best you can and hope they never have to go to court the expense time and emotional toll was significant on my mum if you can encourage them to settle through mediation or similar processes everyone comes out happier however if one sides blatantly not willing to be fair in that process be prepared for a long and arduous process

LifeProTips,not_removed,so sorry to hear you have to go through this it happened to me in my junior year of high school i dont know if i can give advice but i will tell you what i wished id done my lied to me during this time because they thought it will protect your feelings i should have forgiven them sooner additionally they involved me in their fight over finances i should have been more assertive in refusing to participate as well as more careful in where and when i divulged information counselingtherapy was a godsend what i didnt know then was that my family dynamics were irreversibly shattered my parents are much better off separated then they are married but if i thought then that i wouldnt be feeling the consequences some years later i was sadly mistaken protect yourself your feelings your siblings your mom and dad are going to be ok but both in their own hurt they may not realize its the adult children who face some of the most difficult pain
LifeProTips,not_removed,be prepared for some very awkward and annoying attempts at your parents to introduce them to their new partners when they find new if its anything like mine parents will over care for you now and want to know every detail about what happens i didnt get angry as others have said its just a long drawn out extremely boring process
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know im late to the game here but if you are the eldest if siblings and your parents go about it immaturely you may end up in the middle of fights you shouldnt be be prepared to stand up for yourself to either or both parents to let them know that the conflict is between them and they shouldnt bring you into this my parents fought over child support a lot and i was the middle man for most of the arguments
LifeProTips,not_removed,background my parents divorce was awesome it made everyone much happier in the end the only problem was that my mother was still very immature and jumped into another relationship right after and at a very young and important age of i basically lost her and all respect for her i started going out and drinking she didnt even care that i wasnt home all night that turned into a shit storm advice i suggest you support your parents decision and get into counselingtherapy not just you your parents too this is very important most people hide their fear and emotions until one day you just lose it following my own advice im in counseling now and its awesome its one of the best things ive ever done for myself free at my community college im still a work in progress just wish i would have done this much sooner
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents of years split when i was im now i took it the hardest because my older sister was already married and living in another state personally the events that unfollowed degraded my mental health all because i didnt deal with the divorce in a positive way and no one told me how to properly cope with it so lemme lay out a few points dont feel like any unexpected anger or negative emotions are directed to you parents tend to project emotions onto something or someone because of the stress of the divorce procedure in my case i took it as my dad blaming me for the divorce and in turn always felt responsible for possibly being an instigator to the split up dont take their anger with any weight you may hear both parties blame each other for the divorce and will in a way try to have you side with one of them this may be not a regular thing but there will be a dialogue of whats your fathermother saying to you remember to stay neutral and not let their rhetoric demonise the other parent for you it will only exacerbate resentment refrain euphemism for dont fucking do it from turning to alcohol pills or other self destructive behaviours as a result of the news my account of this was i started taking more benzos just to not deal with the oh shit my family is splitting up now what the hells gonna happen all this does is block your ability to rationally process the event and finding positive mechanisms tying into the last point the experience can cause situational depression which can sometimes lead into either drugalcohol use to cope its imperative to understand that the divorce is between the parents it may feel easy to blame yourself for everything but thats not what happened youre just a bystander in this communicate with your parents about how you feel so they can make adjustments in their actions to ensure your well being when the time comes and theyre living separate be sure to make it known you still value them as individual parents this helps them realise that they still have their offsprings love and care which is extremely valuable to someone who lost their other half have someone whos a family friend or a close relative as a confidant its always positive to have someone to talk sense into the situation and not make you feel as much of a victim dont be the one to be your parents goto for ranting all it accomplishes is a slow deterioration of your parental bond not to mention its really emotionally taxing you absolutely have a right to tell them how to manage their divorce ie having them remain civil or request them to make adjustments for your well being final point is it is not your fault and they are still your parents they may not be together but as individuals they have your best interests in mine the divorce is between parents but the parents have a duty to ensure that you op is to be parented no differently without proper communication positive coping mechanisms reassurance paternal and maternal love and universal understanding op might have a good chance of having a negative impact on your health its not your fault and your parents still love you unconditionally
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had talked my mother into divorcing my father and that unintentionally led to my fathers death i had a great relationship with both parents and i still have a great relationship with my mother my father was abusive and i was her only outlet my father was struggling with substance abuse and i was the only one who stood with him he was a great man and a great father but not a great husband i have three siblings who basically hid from all of this my only advice is to not choose sides and to support your parents through the rough times theyre going through offer your support and be a beacon of peace i wish the best for you and your family

LifeProTips,not_removed,first off im so sorry that this is happening my moms been divorced three times once before i was born and twice while i was growing up i would say my top advice is to not pick sides love them both unconditionally the best you can despite anger and resentment you may have secondly love yourself continue to have confidence in yourself and realize that just because their relationship didnt work out that doesnt mean your future relationship wont lastlearn from their mistakes love is risky but its so worth it also keep a journal make writing in it a priority i wish you happiness through this trial
LifeProTips,not_removed,the most important lesson i learned was that to not let their decisions ruin you your parents are people carrying with them deep flaws and insecurities as much as you are able do not let those flaws or those battles determine your life good luck friend its not easy
LifeProTips,not_removed,forgive me i am not making lite or sport of your circumstances i wish you nothing but the best and good luck however i think you should take a look at this things you absolutely should not do p cry uncontrollably every time you see them especially when they are together always tell them how sorry you are that you know its your fault they are splitting up immediately develop interesting and unsavory friends from school and make sure to bring them around to your house as often and in as many numbers as possible make sure to collect empty beer bottles and leave them lying around the bushes outside your house under no circumstances should you drink get your meals outside of your house for a few weeks and every time they ask about dinnerbreakfast you reply im just not hungry make sure your google search history has plenty of searches for things like depression effects of cocaine am i pregnant how do i know if im pregnant how do i know who the father is if im pregnant are red rash spots herpes and lastly how teenagers cause divorce about a month or so of this and these responses to your recent behavior should become familiar to you how much they love you and its not your fault this new to you mid sized sedan should be proof enough of that of course you can get your own credit card on my account yes you can spend christmas with your dad and his insert your own choice here and me your mother who really loves you yes divorce is hard on your grades and last but not least when you did that awful insert the name of torrid event here you were merely acting out you should also look for words like evil manipulating teenage fucking bastard usually screamed at either you or about you to indicate a the jig might be up b you should really reconsider the efficacy of taking advice from the internet and c you should probably get the fluctuating tuna prices out of your parents immediate vicinity until you graduate from medical school
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck it youre moving out to go to university soon anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,about the best thing that i can suggest is to stay aware of the fact that this has nothing to do with you regardless of anything that may be said this isnt your fault also keep yourself safe if you dont feel safe just dont get out call someone you trust whatever you have to do and take care of your mental health if that means that you cant handle being around one of your parents then let them know that if they cant cope then thats their problem youre mental health is much more important than any obligation or social contract i had a very hard time coping with my fathers emotional outbursts during my familys divorce but he was very understanding you have to look out for yourself and your mental and physical health more than ever my parents divorced when i was after almost years of marriage and it was toughjust not for the reasons that most people think my father loved my mother and my mother didnt care like at all she had been cheating on him since i was my sister is the product of an affair and was never exactly a model parent we were dragged all over for no reason things were blown way out of proportion for absolutely no reason at all and things got messy like i cant even explain here long story short in my confusion i helped my mother file a protection from abuse order that wasnt necessary and my father was needlessly hurt in missing so much of his oldest daughters life this is their battle not yours always been close to your dad great keep that up have a tradition of grabbing brunch on sunday with mom keep that up too theres no reason to stop associating with either parent unless its harmful to you if its uncomfortable youre also well within your right to refuse to speak about one parent in the presence of the other youre not a mole youre a human being if they want to talk to each other they know how keep your chin up this isnt the end of the road just a new and different chapter of your life
LifeProTips,not_removed,i went through a similar situation when i was i was put into more awkward situations than i was comfortable with family family friend gatherings especially if your parents resent each other like mine did they will probably speak ill of each other in front of you and try and get you to agree with them in some kind of way to help themselves feel better dont give in to it keep strong and neutral hopefully the divorce doesnt change up your life situation living situation school etc too much most importantly things will get better im sure things feel like a mess right now but eventually things will calm down both your parents will find new lives that you can be apart of personally looking back im glad my parents got their divorce because they both ended up happier apart both of them being happier will make you feel happier too i promise best wishes
LifeProTips,not_removed,divorce is great no more fighting two christmass tired of one go stay with the other i am so happy my parents got divorced just dont let them try to use you to get back at the other unless that works in your favor
LifeProTips,not_removed,im my parents who were married for years have been divorced for almost years shoot me a pm or reply with questions id be glad to answer
LifeProTips,not_removed,this would largely depend on the nature of their divorce but something you might have to deal with is the role of intermediary we can end up being one of the few people that both parents entrusts while knowing that the other does as well so you become a source of information and might need to censor your interactions wth one from the other in terms of how you judge them to be doing or what you think of the other parent this is assuming a neutrality where you youre avoiding either from feeling like they were at greater fault or less valuable as a parent
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats exactly how long my parents lasted i was at the time but what i learned and even through my own personal relationships almost ten years later is that your happiness matters most and if youre not happy then splitting up is the right thing to do sometimes distance apart from each other helps get the mind back on track with your own goals and that may be perfect for your parents and oh my god please please watch the movie boyhood even if youre a girl the message is perfect for you to listen to and see it was a movie ten years in the making really opens up your perspective on relationships over time

LifeProTips,not_removed,it is not easy my parents divorced when i was just starting high school and everything changed it will be tough it will be depressing but it gets better trust me my parents are still on good terms with eachother and hopefully yours will be too i am happier now than i was before my parents got divorced because now there isnt constant arguments between them having your parents get divorced isnt nice at all but believe me it gets better no matter how bad it seems
LifeProTips,not_removed,tell them you wont be their message carrier be angry at the other in private
LifeProTips,not_removed,first of all i promise everything will be okay there are a ton of comments here and you probably wont read this but hopefully this is useful my parents arent divorced but theyve had a pretty rough relationship for my entire life and in a sense it resembles a lot of things people seem to be mentioning from their own experiences so ill offer my two cents i was when i found out my dad had an affair i just turned that really affected me along with every other facet of my parents relationship with each other ive spend most of my life being confused i dont know if i like my father or if hes a good person i know my mom isnt as perfect and morally good as she always said she was its been a really tough time for me because i was caught between them and constantly getting conflicting messages from the two of them it can really mess you up so my advice to you is this try to remove yourself from the situation dont try to rationalize anything they do or say itll just add more confusion to your life theres something wrong with the two of them and theyre doing something that they think will help them dont try to concern yourself too much with them youll just get more confused its always important to have a certain amount of certainty in your life but thats going to change now so the only place you can find any certainty is within yourself just try to focus on yourself and dont let anything they say or do affect you ultimately this could be a great opportunity for you to learn how to be a more fully formed and strong adult good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,it really sucks but with time it will get better the doubling of holidays and birthdays helps but it also makes for much stress during those times both parents want you at there respective families holidays and it becomes a bit much for one day if you have siblings talk with them stay together as the oldest sibling i took it wrong went to alcohol and didnt look back im much better now and now have like awesome family members instead of everyone deals with things differently just try not to let it affect you in a way where you jeopardizing youre future if that makes sense

LifeProTips,not_removed,something to note thats kind of comforting is that divorces are pretty damn common these days it felt really lonely sometimes to go to your friends houses and to see loving families but if you look hard enough youll realize that a lot of your friends are probably also in your situation about a fifth of my friends come from divorced families of this fifth nobody really ever talked about it in retrospect if they were anything like me it mightve been kind of shameful well shameful isnt the right word i didnt feel ashamed just kind of embarrassed it wasnt my fault so i knew i shouldnt be but i was also it wasnt something id bring up so like nobody would know same with them i hadnt ever asked them hey do your parents love each other because thats a bizarre question the point simply is that nobodys really looking down on you and i can say this from the other side i found out some of the friends that i loved and respected the most came from divorced families that fact actually allowed me to really come to terms with how meh of a thing it was anyways research also shows that a divorce can be as emotionally draining as a death in the family on kids so how you take it could be pretty serious or not at all and any reaction is valid and fine it might be better that they split actually two people chained together and hating each others guts isnt an ideal situation it creates a lot of awkward and sometimes tense situations when theyre apart that happens less often and if theyre at the point of seriously considering a divorce its not as if the finalization of the divorce means that there wont be any quality family time anymore that ship has sailed a long time ago or at least thats how my parents divorce was these days i can see that it was for the better and it doesnt really affect me much at all its as much a part of me as the my birthmark which is a lima bean sized potato shaped brown thing on a my leg which is to say that its just something that was a part of me that brings me neither shame nor joy like if someone brings up the topic i can discuss it with zero emotions attached to it i have joked about it with close friends for instance at this point even someone hoping to really hurt me couldnt do it by using the divorce because i care so little about it now which is to say that if youre like me and your situation is a like mine then theres a good chance that in the future youll think it kind of silly that you ever thought you needed advice on coping like its a lame thing that happened but lame things like tickets happen all the time it honestly hasnt deeply or permanently affect me maybe taking the long view on it would help
LifeProTips,not_removed,just dont do what i didam doing say nothing to anyone i havent actually discussed it with a single person my mum left and when ever my dad starts talking about i walk off if my mum starts talking about it ill just completely blank her even if you dont talk with your parents talk to a friend hell someone on reddit would do i know it sounds cliché but just dont bottle your feelings up
LifeProTips,not_removed,what about the double christmas and birthday presents look on the bright side
LifeProTips,not_removed,if they dont communicate well with one another after the divorce you could pit them against one another and use the strife to your advantage to get things you wouldnt have been able to get if they had stayed together
LifeProTips,not_removed,theyre going to fight and its probably your fault so choose your favorite one wisely because the other is going to resent you for life
LifeProTips,not_removed,all i can say is at least they are both still alive cherish the time you have with them as it could all be over before you know it
LifeProTips,not_removed,you might experience that you unconsciously see one of your parents as more of a victim and therefor will sympathize with that person more and perhaps even take on more of a parent role for that person as another redditor said divorce is completely normal there is a reason for their divorce and i can only imagine that divorce is a better alternative than an unhappy broken marriage cest la vie life goes on you will be fine and now if you are lucky you will get twice as many gifts always look at the bright side the divorce is not your fault and make sure you see or talk to both your parents fairly often not necessarily every day so you wont get any guilt trips about favoring one over the other edit dont stress too much you could let your parents know that you are their for both of them if they need anything but at the same time tell them that this is their war and you are just an innocent bystander
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok first off this whole process is ridiculously stressful for everybody involved try not to be too upset if people are short tempered a lot of the time now actually useful things that you can get on with if youve got younger siblings do your best to help them as much as you can your parents are going to be busy and stressed beyond belief see and everything else is going to be changing for them and youre probably the person in the best position to provide stability for them comfort them help them with their homework tell your parents that youll look after them for a while if needed give them something else to distract them whatever you can do to try to help is good similarly if youve got older siblings realise that theyre likely to be doing the same for you and make it as easy for them as possible and hell comfort them as well they need the support as much as you do try not to stress your parents out any more than they already are stressed let them worry about all of the crap that you need to worry about with a divorce dont get into any trouble at school look after yourself as much as you can offer to cook dinner clean the house whatever else you can do to help get information find out whats going to happen where are you going to be living will you be moving between two houses if so on what schedule are you going to be changing schools will you be needing to move any clubs whatever you do if so start looking for a good one to move to as soon as you know where youre going to be moving to speak up for yourself if you arent happy with the arrangements you find out in in the sense that there is a specific alternative that you would prefer within the context of what your parents are doing obviously nobody involved in this is going to be perfectly happy with everything tell your parents that you arent happy and what your preferred option is and try to make sure it happens youre as involved in it as anybody else is and you should make sure that everybody is aware of what your position is rather than just letting them guess what you want find someone you trust who you can talk to about it it could be a friend a teacher an actual councillor whatever somebody who isnt involved is best so not a relative or one of your parents friends if youve got good options outside of that hell it could be an anonymous service on the internet or by phone if theres nobody you feel comfortable talking to something about though id suggest someone you actually know as much as possible make sure your teachers are aware of whats happening at least on a basic level tell them now and theyll be looking out for you offering support teachers are trained in this stuff and at the very least will be able to give you advice point you to people who can help you and being more forgivingsmoothing out problems that thing about everybody being stressed and irritable applies to you as well no matter how much you try to avoid it and all of that helping your siblings taking the load off your parents takes time and it might be difficult to keep up with everything and at the very least you really dont need school stuff putting more stress on than youve already got
LifeProTips,not_removed,parents are human humans make mistakes mistakes may be what lead to the divorce and it is unlikely anything that you could have helped nor anything you caused human emotion is a very complex thing and time can wear away at a relationship they will likely regress and start acting out its probably a coping mechanism if youre the oldest or the only child dont let them take away your childhood dont feel like you need to take care of them and be an emotional crutch or that you need to be a parent to your siblings live your life or a part of you may later regret missing out on being a teenyoung adult it took me a long time to get to the point where i believe it is better for a child to see two happy parents even if that means theyre separated than to see two miserable parents spending their lives together as for you find positive examples of what a relationship should look like learn what it means to be in an equal partnership with someone learn what it means to appreciate another person to love another person and to accept another person learn how to resolve conflicts in a relationship in a constructive way dont let the negatives from your parents divorce dictate how you perceiveapproach future relationships good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my experience divorce makes parents away coolermore lax im glad my parents got divorced i feel like it is overblown anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,i went through the same thing some years back so i know the feeling feel free so shoot me a pm the biggest piece of advice i can give you is absolutely do not get in the middle of it both of your parents will most likely try and bring you into it to prove their respective points secondly it is not your fault and never tell yourself that third it gets easier right now it probably feels like everything is falling apart but in time things work themselves out
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents had a really nasty split when i was it was awful and i had some bitterness issues come from it but in the long run i think it made me more self sufficient i had to be more serious about school and work early on so my work ethic now im is spectacular and my mom really tried to make things good for me so she was very lenient as far as teenager rules go which allowed me the freedom to really be who i wanted to be silver lining for sure but its important to focus on what will make you stronger and not see yourself as a victim much love
LifeProTips,not_removed,you gotta go to college soon once your there you have to move around a lot after that youll become desensitized to becoming sentimental about things in life that inevitably have to change
LifeProTips,not_removed,theyre divorcing because something in their relationship didnt work out and has absolutely nothing to do with you its fine to feel guilty but the fact is you arent guilty of anything people separate some relationships actually most relationships either dont last or shouldnt last as long these things happen everyday take it in stride and focus more on your development as a person than trying to mend something that probably wont be fixed
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents started getting a divorce when i was now im and theyre still in that process i too felt similarly to you it felt like my world got torn apart i have a few pieces of advice for you this first one is really important dont be afraid to talk to them about it ive found that speaking to my parents has helped me get a better understanding of the situation and often it helps them understand it better to because as someone further up said they have no idea whats going on either always get both sides to the story my dad is far more extroverted than my mum and i stayed living with my dad whilst my mum moved out so id spent the last years only hearing my dads version of events and being very angry and distant with my mum she cheated on him multiple times after years of marriage and let him go insane whilst denying it and telling him and ev everyone else that he was just going insane after years months ago me and my brother finally confronted her for her version of events granted his held more weight but it definitely helped me view the situation more objectively and less one sided my last point is also important if you have any siblings nows your time to bond youre all going through the same thing and will all know varying amounts of information about the situation talk to eachother me and my brother years older never really bonded and it always felt awkward to be around him as i didnt know him after talking to him on a brother to brother basis about how were feeling weve become really close and its lovely weve agreed to support eachother as much as possible through this if you have no siblings id suggest talking to your friends who went through the same things etc lastly hold in there ive almost reached the end of the tunnel and before you know it you will too best of luck to you friend
LifeProTips,not_removed,kindly but firmly make it clear your role isnt to pass messagesinformation between them and stick with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,life is going to suck for a while big things are changing that you do not have control over and its not your fault but its now something you now have to deal with your living situation is changing you may be living with just one parent and visiting the other occasionally you may be splitting time roughly evenly or something somewhere in between and theres a good chance it wont be entirely your decision there are going to be times when emotions run high for yourself your parents your siblings if you have any and there are going to be fights over dumb things you may get mad at something as a result of the new situation and have an outburst saydo things you wouldnt normally some people in similar situations have coped with the changes by drinking or doing drugs damaging property or self harming to take control have a sense of control over something these are short term solutions with long term consiquenes if youre in your teens youve got to focus on finishing high school getting to collgea career and you dont want to do things now to make that harder some people start a new hobby some people go to therapy some people talk with friends and family youve got to to find what works for you to get through the upcoming changes while putting yourself in the best position you can for when youre an adult and on your own as far as changes a lot depends on how your parents and you handle the divorce holidaysbig life events can be more difficult as you likely now have to work in locations to visit parents feelings on who to visit when or have people sets of people in the same location that may not get along with each other or act civilly towards each other or it may be completely amicable and everyone could get along my step moms ex husband step brothers father often comes over to my parents house for family christmas dinner which i think is weird but that way he is having christmas dinner with his son and is included it works little things are going to change too the rules at each parents house are going to be a little different one may say you can go out late with friends one may not how to handle it thats a really broad question as best you can i see people sharing their experiences my parents divorced when i was or and it sucked for a long time for a lot of reasons but it got better really wish you the best this is something you can get through even if at times you dont feel that way
LifeProTips,not_removed,its important to understand that this is all your fault and would never have happened if you had tried to be a better child
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents got divorced when i was after years of marriage it will be difficult and if they both love you then prepare for them to be fighting over spending time with you try to make plans with each of them that are set in stone so there isnt any question on who youll be with and when also dont forget to not let that battle get in the way of your own social life
LifeProTips,not_removed,you and i are in the same boat except right now its been nearly two years of divorce hell my parents were married for about years before their attempt to divorce then they got back together a few months later for my siblings and my sake but three years later theyre finally set on it barely any progress has been made its made everything worse my mom tries to come to an agreement on things like the house which my father hasnt resided in for over a year loans and etc with her lawyer but my jerk of a father whom i havent spoken to in months keeps rejecting everything for ridiculous demands for example a trashcan might be worth no more than but hes demanding with no justification despite us having undeniable proof of the trashcans worth but i digress its gotten to a point where i had to drop out of college to help my mom and my two younger siblings in high school the promising career i had worked relentlessly for through high school and the short time i was in college is like a lost dream now being a teenager and going through a divorce is not easy so make sure you have at least someone to discuss things with a good friend teacher or even a random or unknown redditor going through divorce alone will eat away at you fast no one comes out of a divorce without some damage if you take one thing away from my experiences let it be this dont let their divorce destroy you dont let their financial problems depression anxiety guilt etc become your own like with whats happened with me dont let the problems between them push you away from either parent if you let any of that in itll end up hurting you more than it ever should like its hurting me
LifeProTips,not_removed,so iv been in your shoes and while its get to be a total shitfest theres one thing youll eventually figure out they are better apart than they were together my parents stopped fighting my dad started drinking less it was just a healthier situation overall
LifeProTips,not_removed,i went through the same exact thing about years ago my parents were married for the same amount of years the best way to get through it is to accept your new reality and promise yourself that you will do better with your family take up a bunch of hobbies focus on school focus on what makes you happy i did those things and im doing much better now please pm me if you want to talk
LifeProTips,not_removed,when your parents find new partners you dont have to like them you just have to realize that you do have one thing in common that is very important you both love your parent respect that
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents were married years and my dad cheated on my mom with different women he just turned my life around told me he didnt love me ive lost literally everything even my girlfriend and my friends over this shit i really need to know how to handle this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think anyone will ever be able to prepare in the truest sense of the word for something like that even if your folks have been having that conversation for a while youre not exactly sure how to react when it happens its like jumping off a diving board when youre up there what do you do exactly my advice would be to take it one day at a time and find a friend or a counselor whos able and willing to listen without having to be compelled to give you advice every second its nice to have someone to talk to it may not necessarily be about the divorce in particular although you could talk about that but dont be afriad to open up about other things like things you love if youre a religious person prayer is great i prayed a lot and find something youre passionate about and love doing eg art music sports etc it may not always take your mind off things but itll help you cope dont forget that you are loved no matter what happens you are loved dont you ever forget that
LifeProTips,not_removed,tbh idk if a divorce is better at your age than if you were younger but my parents divorced when i was and its changed the person i was i became a lot less emotional and cold but i also became more ambitious in an attempt to get away from all of that also it kinda made me create walls and use humour as a defense mechanism from getting too close with anyone i also became very proficient with lying as i had to constantly hide my feelings so all in all i have small trust issues with confiding in people but being unemotional and only thinking logically while being good at lying has made me a very successful person the setback is you dont ever feel happy and normal ever again being disconnected from your emotions allows you to read people really easy and girls dig the lack of emotions because they think they can fix you and shit its up to you to decide if my story made me into a better person a toxic one but its just my story you have control of how you deal with it so dont be afraid to seek help i never did and ill regret it for the rest of my life
LifeProTips,not_removed,going to lose house i grew up in and have to move meh lots of kids have to move parents lose jobs get transferred etc you need to be thankful for all you have in life
LifeProTips,not_removed,im going through the exact same thing right now im also having to move out of my house and its definitely not fun and can be stressful but it really isnt the end of the world even though it may seem like that at first divorce isnt always a bad thing sometimes people just need to move on something that has helped me is talking to a friend who had to deal with the same thing keeping everything bottled up inside will only make it worse
LifeProTips,not_removed,the best advice i can give you is that if one parent starts bad mouthing the other ask them to stop let them know it hurts you when they do that and dont let them put you in the middle if they have a problem with something the other parent did they need to talk to the other parent about it my parents would always put me in the middle and it was awful
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents got divorced when i was one thing you can know for certain is that this is a very big change for them my mom was a homesick brit but after the divorce shes living in a camper on acres of private land and loving it it scares us to death to see all the terrible racist redneck people she befriended but luckily she hasnt adapted their traits my father on the other hand grew very bitter he distanced himself from everyone in our family now my sisters my mother and i are all in one house for christmas and ive my sister and myself both say its great to get the whole family back together im only the divorce wasnt long ago and there is a lot more change ahead of me my parents divorce was very civil and calm yet sudden although neither of have ever said anything im pretty sure my dad just caved in and accepted my mom doesnt love him anymore even if its civil that doesnt mean its equal try your best to be there for both of your parents they may not know it yet but they need you
LifeProTips,not_removed,they may attempt to use you as a weapon i sincerely hope not but just be aware that this can be a thing my siblings and i were very regularly used like this example if we acted bad my mother would call our dad and tell him to come get his kids if we acted well she would consider us her kids it sounds like simple stupid antics but its a mind game that screwed both us and our relationship with our dad over until we realized it we started to associate being bad with our dad she would constantly berate him tell us how horrible he was etc it carried over subconsciously she was using us to get to him unbeknownst to us she would use our words in court when we parroted her bullshit back to her do not let either parent affect your view of the other parent just be aware of it if its happening and dont allow yourself to become a pawn in any game it may happen it may not they might not even be aware if theyre doing it just let it slide off your shoulders and make up your own mind about your parents individually at the end of the day both of your parents love you dont ever let anyone or anything come between that not even your other parent
LifeProTips,not_removed,think about it like this nothing will really be any different i mean things will be different but in years time the new normal will be the normal for you if that makes sense when you moved schools it was a new world etc an you adapted an moved on talk to people in real life if you need to find ways to make you happy this can be thing you did before or after the break up and know that although in rare cases a kid can have a big impact on a break up they didnt break up after years because of you and they will be happier adults for it also unless your a really bad kid they will still love you an its about them not you
LifeProTips,not_removed,okay for the sake of varied advice im going to share when my parents split it was messy in retrospect it developed into an incredibly unhealthy relationship that ultimately ended with police assistance my parents still rarely talk and theres a lot of bitterness on either side i never felt angry so i cant comment on that i can only really comment on the stress produced i learned to accept that their split ultimately had nothing to do with me their problems were not mine and their relationship failed on their failures not mine guilt should not be a thought in your mind the sentimental attachment to childhood homes also doesnt really make much sense to me its a house there are hundreds just like it who cares your parents may very well badmouth each other blame each other or otherwise just maliciously or carelessly try to turn you against the other parent dont try to argue with them but also dont take anything they say as absolute emotions are running high and they will be looking to vent if you want to make it clear that you dont want to be vented to it might not make them feel any better but if youre not so good at ignoring it then it could help but also be aware of your parents channels while its tough on you if they dont have anyone else to vent to they cant only turn their anger inwards keep an eye on your parents this is one that is hardest even to advise youre going to see your parents at their weakest theyre going to be hurting stressed and generally prone to going somewhere dark they can shut themselves off to the world they cant shut themselves off to their children even if theyd want to this is the most stressful part and it will stick with you but you really are the one who can do most good if a parent starts down a bad path dont try to fix things yourself though consist yourself an observer if things start going bad find other people close aunts uncles other siblings grandparents their friends and even your other parent
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey man my parents divorced before i can even remember they both remarried my father before i can remember as well and my mother when i was both sets of grandparents divorced while i was in my teens then both sets of parents as well going through divorces i can tell you one thing you and parents will be miserable for one or two years then they will be happier than you have ever seen you dont understand the trouble they are going through right now you will tho just be there for them they may not be so for you but this is more about their life than yours everyone will be happier after and you will be able to accept it its hard im not going to lie to you but i wish you the best of luck because you and them will need it
LifeProTips,not_removed,take some solace in knowing that both of your parents made a tough decision but it was ultimately what will make them both happier in the long run so many families can be torn apart by parents whod rather stay together for their kids when neither of them are happy and this usually leads to much more negative impacts on the children than if theyd just gotten divorced if youve got siblings youll absolutely grow closer to them whether you like it or not if you have younger siblings you have to show them that its not the end of the world and eventually things wont just get back to normal but theyll be better and everyone will be happier trust me my parents got divorced when i was like and it sucked at the very beginning but now years later theyre both completely different but completely happy and it makes me happy to see that theyre each living better lives than before
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents divorced when i was it was messy my advice would be to advocate for yourself if youre old enough you can make decisions about who you want to live with etc although this varies depending on where you live you deserve a happy ending too also get a therapist divorce can bring out complicated emotions and its best to talk it out
LifeProTips,not_removed,wonder if its helpful to get a perspective from someone who is a parent with teenagers and is going through separation and presumably divorce thats me im i have children daughter son son been married years separated months ago because i suffer from depression my name is nigel and you can ask me anything
LifeProTips,not_removed,remember that your parents are individuals in their own journey and want to be happy as much as you but im sure you come before either of their happiness but thats about it try to remember that and support their pursuit of happiness
LifeProTips,not_removed,i will tell you that when it happened to us we were fine at firstthen me and my brother started internalizing it and it manifested in different ways he had some anger issues got addicted to wow he impoved but he does kinda drink a lot but hes in school trying to be a dr i got major anxiety from it some minor depression the anxiety ws killer and im still trying to claw my way back to a normal life at this happened in i moved a lot too stayed with my dad dont become pawns in your parents games if they play any i would seek some low cost community therapy and talk it out dont internalize it
LifeProTips,not_removed,this happened to me when i was a teenager and i dealt with it badly very badly if i could turn back the clock and have an open conversation with myself i think these would be the key points pay attention to schoolwork dont allow personal trauma to give you a sense of entitlement that means you can shrug off your responsibilities let teachers and friends know that there will be times ahead when you might need some extra support look after number one set boundaries be there for your family but be aware of compassion fatigue we only have so much bandwidth to deal with things if youre pissed off find a productive way of channelling it sport art it doesnt matter this challenging time has the potential to make you into a stronger more compassionate person ive no doubt youll handle it brilliantly and all the advice in this thread is really good
LifeProTips,not_removed,be ready to become an adult really freaking fast my parents divorced when i was i got a cellphone were talking here not the time every toddler had the latest iphone and a laptop and was basically told to figure shit out get ready to deal with money lawyers taxes and insurance companies it took me a couple of years but get ready to be thrown in the adult world

LifeProTips,not_removed,from observing it happen to others around me i can say one important thing is to not take things personally its not about you second parents will use you to hurt each other you will be a tool in their warfare again do not take it personally you need however to be aware when someone is being extra nice to you because they are trying to slap the other one by implying they are the better parent it can be a nasty situation but again its not about you luckily it wont go through that sort of crap and its civil
LifeProTips,not_removed,ask yourself this would you rather your parents are unhappy together or happy apart
LifeProTips,not_removed,not sure how your parents will end up acting but my biggest advice i can give you dont listen to the bad talk from either one of them dont let them influence your opinion of the other you have to form your own opinions i had a stepmother and mother who hated eachother for whatever reason they would both say bad things about the other i would just take it all with a grain of salt
LifeProTips,not_removed,my situation was pretty comparable to yours when i was my parents announced that they were already divorced out of the blue after years of marriage i was completely caught offguard and had missed all of the warning signs that their marriage wasnt happy because it was all i had ever known i dont really have any advice for you but ill let you know that this was the point in my life when i realized my parents were very flawed human beings their divorce is the point that demarcates one half of my life from the other my outlook on life changed so completely that i can cleanly draw a line between who i was before the divorce versus who i became afterwards the divorce brought out the worst from both sides and what started as an amicable yet strained relationship turned ugly over time due to numerous factors it was frightening to see two people who had always been cordial but not necessarily loved one another become completely different people my mom remarried after five months my dad all but dropped out of my life and we moved out of my childhood home to delve into my stepfathers completely different lifestyle ranching i wont lie it was incredibly tough and incredibly heartbreaking to transition into what felt like somebody elses life now several years later we have an awkward sense of normalcy although it is completely different than i ever would have imagined before the bombshell news would my life have been better had my parents stayed together maybe not however i wasnt happy with the way things turned out and i will warn you that i still am not depending on how things proceed with your parents divorce you may end up with this deep dissatisfaction but that is really in your parents control you just have to roll with the punches separate yourself if need be when you can and vow that you wont become who your parents prove themselves to be but this is just one anecdote and everyones divorce story is different one of my friends from high school had her parents divorce when she was much younger but her parents remained friends they literally lived across the street from each other and would hang out all the time in their minds they werent suited for marriage but were still best friends while i think this situation is a bit unusual i just wanted to let you know that not all divorces turn ugly if your parents divorce does find a support group be it in the form of siblings or friends and remember that it isnt your problem or your fault it ultimately boils down to being your parents issue
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hope you like it
LifeProTips,not_removed,just prepare for a lot of bullshit but never let it destroy relationships with the people you love and want in your life i no longer speak to most of my family because of my parents divorce it sucks ass and youll never stop missing those people
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont internalize your emotions if needed go see a therapist i wish id have listened and gone now im overweight anxietyridden depressed and just coming out of all of the mess if you will that we call divorce therapy works and thats beginning to dawn on me now so please please please go see a therapist if you even think you need to theres no harm in just going for a few sessions i hope your journey is easier and more comfortable than mine
LifeProTips,not_removed,my main advice would be to live your own live and dont get shoved around by your parents maybe your mother wants you to move out with her maybe you would want to rather stay with your father you are probably old enough that you can decide things like that yourself assuming your father is okay with that you will need to decide more things yourself like ifwhen you want to visit the other parent
LifeProTips,not_removed,something i heard while my parents were getting divorced its better to come from a broke home than to live in one i was and in school my younger brother was it all works out eventually but it is a fucking hard thing to go through just hang in there best wishes
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents got divorced my freshman year of colleges you know what my relationship with them became so much better before they were always trying to avoid being home or socializing with uskids its great there both super chill and i feel like i know them a lot better theyre both so much happier with out each other its great
LifeProTips,not_removed,been through it myself try and stay as close to both of them as you can refuse to talk sides dont allow that they will at some point directlyindirectly influence your judgement on the other hopefully not but if you catch on just state you dont mind listening but you are not taking sides in terms of what uthereakkroquefort says the role swapping thing is also true if you ever need your own space from it all thats okay too you cant keep the family glued together all the time and you might feel like it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i went through the same thing a year or so ago just that im years old so not technically a teen but i do live with my father as im still a student if i can say anything at all its that things will get better at first you cry and you dont know how anything will be fine at all but as time goes by you realize that life goes on it is not your resonsibility to fix the relationships of your parents just make sure you stay as close as possible to all family members you will eventually start a life of your own and everything will be alright fast forward a year and my girlfriend of years leaves me now i try to tell myself the same thing but it just gets worse and worse so i know that you will probably not believe me because its hard as fuck to view things from the outside when you are balls deep in shitemotions

LifeProTips,not_removed,youll be fine divorce isnt intrinsically bad the worst thing about it is the way people can behave during it if your parents behave well then its just a normal though potentially complex break up as im sure youve experienced near or even in your life already
LifeProTips,not_removed,make sure you talk about how you are feeling the more you keep to yourself and try to act like everything is okay the worse you will feel and it can lead to a pretty drastic downward spiral my parents divorced when i was around and my dad never really got over it he drank and passed away before i was old enough to really understand and talk with him be there for both of them and realize that theyll love you no matter what and you need to reciprocate the same onto them they are after all human beings with emotions and difficulties like the rest of us i dont tell you this to scare you just sharing my experiences and what i think you should be aware of i wish you nothing but happiness although it may be difficult right now there are people out here that care about you and how you feel
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents split when i was after years as others have mentioned it definitely brought my sister and i closer over the coming years one thing i did that i think helped was to say to each of them separately to never denigrate the other to me about anything no matter what happens both will still be your parents and you will always have a relationship with both and they need to respect that i was very blunt about that to them and they accepted it the other thing that happened to me was for the first time i got to know my parents as individual people which looking back makes me wonder how they ended up together as they are so different it was an eye opening experience good luck hopefully if they did years together and nothing catastrophic caused the break up with some time you will all be able to still enjoy shared memories
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont live with the parent that needs you because theyre coping worse live with the parent thats better adjusted to the change this is your big opportunity to learn healthy attitudes to breakups or else to be dumped on and distracted youre also going through at the very least the stress of moving long term your more fragile parent wont be grateful that youre maladjusted and lost respect for them after the shit they put you through by trying to hold it together for you let them know that you want to give them space to deal with it uninhibited by the responsibility of parenting fulltime make dates for really awesome quality time though cheap things like parks and galleries maybe
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone who has been divorced and a kid was involved please always remember this it had nothing to do with you it doesnt mean your parents love you less or that there was anything you could do you prevent it my parents also split when i was younger and i would suggest finding a hobby outside of the house it will get you out of the house in case there are any arguments and it will keep your mind distracted best of luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,talk to a school counsellor school therapist or someone you can trust to keep yourself calm its tough and ive known many friends who have gone through this its not easy and often many of my friends go through it alone only make it harder on themselves
LifeProTips,not_removed,during my teens my parents went through fighting and divorce only to realise that its too hard to divide up the assets and move from their nice house in a nice suburb to seperate shitty apartments so they stayed together still hating and loathing eachother sometimes ill go to visit them and it makes me so sad to see these empty husks bitching about eachother only to try to give me a reassuring smile like theyre just joking divorce would have been the better option i hope it works out for you there will come a day when it gets easier and youll be at peace with their seperation xo
LifeProTips,not_removed,every divorce is unique my parents divorce actually went pretty smoothly they never fought and always tried to put my interests and welfare first it was the postdivorce life that was a bit tougher my relationship with each of my parents changed pretty drastically after the divorce though i think im a better and more empathetic person because of it before my parents split i wasnt very close to my dad since he was a much older parent yrs when i was born the divorce was a real reality check for him to not take family for granted he became such a loving and involved father for the second half of my childhood and is still my number one fan to this day it wasnt perfect though my dad had never not had a partner taking care of him so i definitely acted like the parent sometimes that aspect of the divorce is easier the older you are he remarried ten years ago now and my stepmom makes him really happy and does a great job looking after him she can be pretty annoying but i am thankful to have her in my family for the most part my mom wasnt quite so simple she had a midlife crisis of sorts and felt like she had missed out on her youth by marrying so young her dating life was and is by far the toughest hurdle that came from the divorce she got remarried pretty quickly to an abusive alcoholic divorced again dated a few randoms shacked up with a pot head hippy who pulled a gun and threatened to shoot her when she tried to break up with him and is now dating a dude years her junior i love my mom dearly but damn has she made it difficult for me to not be utterly terrified of committed relationships so there are good and bad parts to any divorce what matters most to me though is that my parents are happy and have healthy relationships my mom and dad have actually developed an amazing friendship over the years and we all celebrate birthdays and holidays together my stepmom included there will be times when you will be angry with your parents especially if they are being dicks to one another or have an awful so hang in there and try to keep in mind that its just a phase the chaos will eventually die down both your parents are just trying to be happy though they may take a few wrong turns while trying to figure it out
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my case over time i have understood why it happened and that it was most likely best that way they split up years ago and my parents where together since they where about they where about when they split up after some time i understood that you dont meet the girl you should spend your life with at you have to live a little and shop around to understand who you should be together with for the rest of your life now that i understand why it happened i have no problems with it things could have been better but things could have been way worse as well i dont know how old you are but at about you will probably move out after that you will be more concerned and happy for your parents if they enjoy life instead of being angry with them splitting up my new stepdad has tough me a lot of new things my father never could or would have to me the most important part is that both my parents are enjoying life i of corse would have loved it if we could have celebrated christmas or thanksgiving with them but how nice would it be if they werent happy best of luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,i made the mistake of not accepting how much it was messing me up here i am years later and i feel like im a completely different person than i was then and not for the best just find someone and open up to them even if its hard or doesnt seem necessary talking is absolutely necessary
LifeProTips,not_removed,the huge upside is you will have alot more freedom to spend with your friends thats what i got out of it and not having to live with two people who openly disliked each other too

LifeProTips,not_removed,dont let them separate im ten yrs old when my parents have a divorce and all this time im living like a hell dont let them divorce please im concern at your state
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know this is late but i hope you read this the biggest regret i have was not standing up for myself i spend my time evenly between my mums and my dads since i was and im now but i would much rather spend most of my time with my mum this would be seen as me loving one parent more than the other when thats not the case the case is my mums house is a healthier environment to live in do not let your parents guilt trip you into something do not let this happen so please if you read this love your parents equally but dont put their happiness before yours you have to remember that while theyre going through stuff you are too and maybe even more than they are you have to live between houses now you have to split your time for celebrations birthday christmas etc and you are the one that doesnt really have a home anymore this doesnt mean that you cant support them but dont let them make decisions for you because as much as youre their child it is your life just stand up for yourself and let your parents know how you honestly feel also you may move a lot in the next couple of years i went from living in one house to now having lived in ten money may be tight so dont be asking for money every five seconds my mum was pretty much broke for the first couple of years after the split hope this helped and im always here to talk or answer any other questions
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents are reasonable people so when my father moved out both him and my mum became much happier people also you will have to move quite often until you settle down try to help out as much as you can because right now you can learn how to paint fix things and move at someone elses cost
LifeProTips,not_removed,as my whole life has been flipped upside down why your parents are getting a divorce this is not about you
LifeProTips,not_removed,my folks split up when i was it sucks and honestly ive barely spoken to my mom since fact is it gets better and you grow up just fine youll have some awkward holidays and graduations youre not defined by your parents be your own person and this will probably make you be more cautious in relationships later
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is your first time dealing with experiences that are out of your control the hardest part and the easiest part is to accept the outcome of a bad time in your life therell be triggers in you without your knowing its hard to say the least but having the strength to overcome it makes you stronger inside let it sink in that your parents are separating i feel you might be in a state of shock or denial hope things get well soon for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i went through this at my parents had been together years i had to leave my beloved childhood home too the house was unusually large not an easy one to sell so we had to continue living together for a whole year before it was bought we couldnt afford to do it any other way my dad lived in the spareoffice room and my mum stayed in the master bedroom it was hell im not gonna lie they avoided each other totally which is a very weird feeling in your own home my older sister decided to nope outta there as soon as she could and went to work abroad leaving me alone with two fighting parents if i could give any advice itd be this dont let your parents bad mouth each other to you dont let them fight or yell or disrespect each other within each short of you its damaging dont let them force or persuade you to take sides every relationship has two people a breakdown is never ever one persons fault and of course its not your fault that goes without saying i wish id had a close friend or boyfriend at the time or even a therapist i had no one i went through the whole nightmare alone and it was really traumatic make sure you have someone anyone not your parents or siblings or anyone closely involved to talk things through with at the time it felt like the world was literally ending and my house was ground zero but looking back now yes it was definitely a shitty couple of years but i wouldnt change it not even the worst of it it was a doomed relationship id never acknowledged how disconnected they were they never had date nights they never sat and watched tv together they never ate together they never kissed or held hands they didnt share interests or hobbies they were like roommates it was right to divorce at the time it felt like out of the blue bombshell tldr best of luck to you op its gonna be rough for a while but get support and dont let your parents act like dicks to each other
LifeProTips,not_removed,if it does come to each parent trying to pit you against the other or even just unloading to you or sharing things you arent comfortable with it is ok to set some clear boundaries one of the hardest things i ever said to my mother was that i knew she was hurting but i couldnt be the one she talked to about it anymore i wanted so badly to be there for her but it wasnt healthy for me to be put in the middle and i worried it would damage relationship with my dad give them love and patience but also dont be afraid to tell them that they need to respect your relationship with each of them
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents didnt actually go into divorce on paper but whelp since i was half way into high school years now they are separated the baseline of my suggestion is to follow your heart its gonna be somewhat tough if youre like me attached to both sides quite deeply i try my best to settle both sides after they themselves have calmed down you have to be patient very patient dont need to keep emotions to yourself talk with your friends or you know reddit at the end of things just remember that its gonna be alright at the end of the day youre the child of your parents in one way or another you all help each other in your own ways be positive when they are in the shadows be assuring when they wobble but never try to do more than you are capable of over burdening yourself physically or emotionally wont help anyone best wishes to you my friend
LifeProTips,not_removed,first of all im so sorry this is happening to you it is traumatic no matter what the age after years of marriage my parents divorced when i was years old had already moved out and was a newlywed myself i went through the similar depression worldturnedupsidedown loss of my family home and so on even though i was technically an adult the only advice i can give is to look for positive changes while both of my parents were depressed and miserable for awhile my mom ended up becoming this beautiful confident independent woman which is not what i would have called her before even though shes still years later occasionally bitter about the whole thing shes happily single has a group of amazing friends bought her own house has traveled around the us and to europe again i cant imagine any of that happening had she stayed with my dad my dad was a bit harder to watch he went through a string of bad marriages yes marriages not just relationships after the divorce counting my mom and the woman he was married to before my mom hes now been married times however he is now in a healthy marriage with a very nice woman and has stepdaughters the first sisters ive ever had he too is more balanced and happy than i ever knew him growing up he still makes terrible decisions sometimes but altogether it ended up being a positive change for him anyway all this babble is just to let you know that while it sucks right now it may turn out to be a great thing i still mourn the loss of my family sometimes but seeing the positives helps also if you can id suggest some counseling i went for about a month shortly after the divorce and it helped some with the immediate pain and sadness since looking for the positives didnt help until my parents had settled down into their new lives
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents also divorced and to be honest i am now kinda glad they did i was at the time i took it hard i still dont speak to my mom till this day and im now but it made me act for myself i moved out at the age of went to a different city found a girl got a job and now i am really happy with my life and i am sure that wouldnt have happend if they didnt get divorced my father found a new woman and is also really happy we still dont talk to our mother and we still go to court times a year because she is fucked up but yeah be strong
LifeProTips,not_removed,remember that your parents are human too as a teen this is a little bit easier than when youre a kid and your parents are kind of the gateway to the outside world but i think that was a really big lesson to me with my parents divorce i was it was only after about yrs of marriage i had a really tough time with it until i was older and able to realize this
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey man honestly there are so many pros and cons when its comes to divorce my parents have been separated years nowtheyre pretty much divorced and im so i pretty dealt with it through my teen years the best way to look at it is that you still have two loving parents and twice the amount of celebrationschristmas etc dont define this as a bad situation think of it as a new chapter in a rather complicated novel that is full of opportunities be well my friend your parents do play a major role in your life but dont let their decision define who you become
LifeProTips,not_removed,be prepared to do everything yourself my parents divorced when i was in the last year of high school so when i went to university i had to request loans register find a home move and so on all by myself it is quite possibe that youll be forced into a parents role but dont accept that dont be the messenger that runs back and forth between his parents to give hostile messages have your own relationships with both of your parents and dont let them decide wether its better to see the other parent every divorce is different so youll have to find your own way if you need to talk feel free to message me it will all be oke
LifeProTips,not_removed,honestly in the end it all comes down to how your parents handle the divorce my parents have had a divorce as well and now or so years later they are still good friends my dad is my mums boss at work and they interact just so naturally with one another but i guess it was just a very lucky shot for me since not many divorces end up like this the first bit of the whole process will definitely be the hardest one but it will get better and eventually life goes one no matter what you will get through this and only become stronger im sure good luck mate
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess its different for everyone in my case it really sucks for some of the things which happened over the last years theyve been divorced i can never forgive my parents me and all of my siblings also turned out to be pretty big losers trailing large quantities of baggage behind them there are no exceptions to this last fact in my family they never stopped fighting id tell you some of the stuff which has happened over the years but thered be no point to it you probably wouldnt believe me either the only thing you can do to limit the damage is to grow up really fast stand your ground do not become the messenger between them in fact you need to lay down your own rules make it clear you will not be used as a tool between them move out as soon as you can and forget they existed make up your own reality and make your own life try to do the right thing at all times so you can look yourself in the mirror and be proud of who you are
LifeProTips,not_removed,divorce is often a good thing you prefer to have them both happy on their own than have them forced to live together with no love left dont get yourself thinking this is the worst thing that ever happened to you if it is then you have an awesome life just do your things dont overreact and dont change anything that you had planned for your future divorce is a big scary word but in reality its just something that happens to almost anyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont take sides its really tough not to but remember its better to keep out of it and communicating with both sidesif nothing else for the extra birthday pressies youll get used to it just try to make sure you assuming youll stay with your mum dad sees you as much as possible because hell most likely have to leave the house and live on his own and hell be lonely and missing you terribly try to look past the emotion of it all and keep busy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess the only thing i can relate to in thismy parents have been married and divorced three time the last time being when i was a teen is that i faced a difficult choice didnt seem like it at the time of who i wanted to live with i loved my mother and she was the parent my siblings and i were with during all the divorcesbut we were a very religious household and as a teen with all the hormones and being interested in the gothpunk scene and wanting to hang out with whoever i wanted without feeling guilty i decided to move in with my dad because i knew he didnt care and would let me do whatever i wanted i left behind my mom and my twin and older sisternever in my life have i felt so lonelyi think i even got involved in an abusive relationship because i was so lonely and was starving for attention and affection even if it was fake like my abusersobviously thats an extreme example but be prepared to think deeply about perhaps which parent you are more attached to and which parent will in a sense allow you to be around more peoplemeaning which every parenthome is closest to your other family and friends it wont be an easy choice to make and it really can shape how your life plays outwhether youre at a new school now and have to make friends all over and are lonely all the time or whether everything goes the way it always you have every one in your life that you had before only now youre missing a parent tough tough choicebut of course there is visitation so you dont have to worry that you wont ever see the other parent but that is kind of different than choosing who youll be spending the school years with im sorry this is happening to you i totally understand and i hope you come through this in one piece
LifeProTips,not_removed,just know its not your fault try not to stress too much as its likely for the better
LifeProTips,not_removed,im and my parents just got divorced about years ago i have to say that to this day it still affects me whenever i see something touching or intimate i start to get emotional immediately with that said i couldnt be any happier because living with my mom is much better than living with both of them together i also feel it brought out better things for both of them particularly my dad my dad who i thought was one of the most coldest bitter people is now much more loving and affectionate probably because he realized what he had lost he constantly checks up on me and my brother and says i love you everytime something i never experienced growing up all i can say is that you should try to find the good in what happens in your life because no matter what happens there is always something better coming for you finally moving out of my aunts house after years and into our own apartment with my mom and brother
LifeProTips,not_removed,you and i hadhave very similar situations only difference is i was slightly older i was in college siblings in high school the hardest part for all of us has been the aftereffects my mom constantly complains about my dad which honestly she has every right to he hasnt followed through on a lot and was the reason they got divorced but its still hard he was a decently good dad to me growing up and as such i hate hearing him painted in a negative light unfortunately its really changed my mom as a person and while we used to be very close i just have a hard time being around her for extended periods of time now that said i have friends whose parents divorced in similar situations but the splits were much more amicable they still see each other at family events and such and have no problem spending time with each other so i guess the hardest part for everyone is different
LifeProTips,not_removed,did anyone else think op was himself getting divorced from his wife i was about to drop all kinds of knowledge for this guy because i was divorced from my first wife at a fairly early age i was also eleven years old when my parents divorced so i can share some insight there the good news is that things will get easier but it takes time you need to also keep in mind that even though you may not understand their motives right now their divorce doesnt ever change that they each love and care for you individually your parents are likely getting divorced due to issues they are having with one another and that probably means there were more often than not altercations that escalated youll notice that after the divorce things will eventually cool down and you parents will each settle into their aftermarriage life which is becoming increasingly common as time marches on once this settling process has fully occurred youll begin to see that spending time with your parents separately will give you the opportunity to get to know them each more individually and the opportunities you will have might actually become more frequent divorce isnt a beautiful thing but remember it doesnt happen without a cause the most important thing to keep in mind is that you didnt play a part in their decision this will not be comfortable to traverse initially but it will get better
LifeProTips,not_removed,im going through the same thing right now they were married for years things will definitely change including your parents
LifeProTips,not_removed,depending on what kind of people your parents are they may try to pit you against the other dont let this happen i would also say and it wont seem like this now that this is probably a good thing if your parents are getting divorced there has to be a reason
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was when my parents got divorced after close to years of marriage and im now looking back i wish my parents had thought to send me to a therapist during the divorce it was hard navigating it with my older sister she was because my sister blamed my mother and still has deep resentment to this day towards my mom i didnt blame my mother or my father so it was next to impossible to talk to my sister about it she she was so angry at my mom i pretty much had no one to talk to since my parents were so hurt and angry with each other that it made discussing things with them seem impossible to my year old brain i know now that i should have said something but year olds arent known for their rational behavior we ended up living with my father afterwards who was able to keep our house by buying my mother out of it this is very unusual on both issues but it worked out for the best in the end my father was better positioned to take care of us money and maturity wise my mother was very quick to anger and really didnt handle the divorce well it was really really hard on my mother when we said we wanted to live with my father and it would have been as hard on my father if we had lived with her instead it was the best choice in the end but the decision process was difficult it really sucked but im a much happier adult as a result hopefully your parents will stay on speaking terms with each other mine did not and this transition will be easier for you the years following the divorce involved my parents dating people who they didnt end up staying with long term which was at first very awkward since you will most likely view the first people they date as people trying to replace the other parent try to keep in mind that this is not the case and that these other adults are also in an awkward situation these new adults will try to be friendly when you might be angry and upset since its a new situation try to keep a cool head and remember these new people are important enough to your parents that they are introducing them to you thinking back i had no idea my folks had dated a few other people that i never met since they realized it wasnt going to go anywhere after dates i only met the people who they thought might last in a relationship which would have been useful information when i was again lack of rational thought behavior thanks to the joys of teenage hormones once i figured that out things went smoother and i tried to be more open to new people my parents brought home think of it like when you bring a boyfriendgirlfriend home for the first time youre excited and nervous to introduce this person to your family but youve decided theyre important enough to you that you want your family to know them too i know this is still aways off for you but it was something i was completely unprepared for and a heads up would have helped me a lot just remember that your parents will make mistakes so will you try to be understanding but also try to communicate with them about how things are going on in your world it will be challenge for everyone since its a new way of living as a family keep in mind that both of your parents are still your family even if they dont consider each other family anymore anyways feel free to pm me if youre looking to talk i missed out on the opportunity to talk to people about this online those were the dark ages of aol dial up with creepy chat rooms and i think talking to an anonymous person who went through the same thing would have been helpful its nice to be able to talk about the details or ventrage about everything without worrying about anything you say getting back to your folks which also goes back to seeing a professional therapistthey are there to help and i would strongly recommend talking to a professional who can help beyond offering an open ear and sympathy
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont let them play you because i wanted to know the full truth and understand everything that was going on i allowed myself to be thrown into the fray i eventually became a messenger for their childish games and in the end it tore me apart keep focus on doing your thing college uni work social life hobbies etc i ended up dropping out of college and becoming an alcoholic because i got caught up in it all pretty messy divorce all in all im only recently able to get back on with my life just because the world around you is changing it doesnt mean you have to forcibly change with it but part of you does have to go with the flow of what cant be changed jeeze that sounds more difficult than i make it out to be ahahah at the end of it all you will be stronger hope everything works out for you dudedudette although im probably far from the best person to talk to feel free to pm me if you ever wanna talk about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i havent read through the comments so i may be repeating what others have said and apologize if i do my parents began their divorce when i was entering high school talk about timing i say began because it was a year process because my dad did not want to divorce while my mom obviously did im sorry this is happening to you the first thing you have to realize is this is not about you your parents are divorcing each other not you im sure both of your parents love you very much and that hasnt and wont change while this isnt about you it very much effects you dont hesitate to talk cry yell etc express yourself tell people who will listen how you feel dont let this divorce come between you and each parent i made the mistake of blaming my mom thinking she left me i didnt speak to her for over a year i did nothing but hurt myself by doing that there were days where i would just sob because i missed my mom i would want to call her but had convinced myself that she didnt want me this was everything but true you have to communicate with them remember that your parents deserve to be happy too things are going to be weird the first year or so but they get better feel free to pm me if you need more advice from someone who has experienced something very similar
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know people have mentioned this already but stay close to your siblings as a teen im going to wager you have younger siblings be a strong arm for them and watch out for them my parents were trying to have a clean divorce around and i stuck with my sister as things got real messy today we are much closer because we understand eachother better dont let them make you be a go between for a while i was the form of communication between my parents and my dad and his family refuse or walk away this damaged my relationship with my dad for years and is only beginning to recover edit because early and not thinking at capacity remember that no matter what happens you are loved and that you are not to blame talk to someone as you go thru it a therapist or friend that will listen and lend a shoulder im sorry that you have to go thru this
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is already front page so this comment is probably going to get super buried but here goes even clean and good divorces can still hurt for a long time afterward im my parents divorced when i was or so and while mine was definitely the messier sort it still hurts a lot to think about how much better life would be if nothing had gone wrong how the combined finances of both parents would mean your family could afford to go out more or take that trip across the country or just simply afford the day to day bills again i used to cry myself to sleep most nights when they first divorced but now i dont really think about it except when people ask me questions like this or if a lot of problems including frustrations resulting from the divorce compound on each other and leave me upset and frustrated it still hurts years later but i dont cry about it anymore but it still gives me anxiety with how i sometimes have to pick up the slack of not having mom to do my laundry while im at school or making me lunch things like that additionally split custody mine had spending one week with dad and one week with mom comes with a lot of challenges and turmoil if both parents are struggling financially then it can be hard to afford enough clothes personal toiletries school supplies games etc that you arent essentially moving all of your belongings once a week my brother and i each packed a huge duffle bag or more every week carrying all the underwear socks outfits deodorant and cologne hats shoes toothbrushes laptops games school supplies entertainment and whatever else we thought we might need for the week it was easier for my brother who didnt care much about social perception so he could bring along random tshirts shorts and one pair of tennis shoes and be happy so long as he had his laptop i had it harder since i had to bring work uniforms clothes for marching band multiple sneakers and hats a pair of nice clothes just in case one pair of pjs and extra socks and underwear just in case and end up with twice the amount of literal baggage to carry from dads to moms each week i very quickly gave this up shortly after i turned although state law couldve allowed me to do it sooner
LifeProTips,not_removed,some really good advice is to individually look each one in the eye and say i will not tolerate you insulting the other to me they are my motherfather and i will treat any insult of them as i would coming from anyone else keep it to yourself not me call them out on it every time they do so theyll quickly get the idea theyre going to try and sway you and snipe at each other through you this simple rule will save you a shitload of drama and pain
LifeProTips,not_removed,keep focused on being a success for yourself thats the number one thing do well with your own life work hard for you they will be focused on other stuff unfortunately so you need to live your life and be true to you this doesnt mean run off and do extreme things in revolt this means be the best you

LifeProTips,not_removed,parents that divorce should be executed hense till death do you part f your parents run them over with their rental car
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my case and in practically every other divorce example that i know of the most important change is that you begin to lose the parental awe that you have as a child i now think of my parents as simply other people subject to the same tendencies and problems as other people its a strange change but not an entirely negative one in this context keep your head up man things tend to work themselves out if you wanna talk about it pm me my situation was pretty much as bad as it gets so i might know a thing or two
LifeProTips,not_removed,i experienced the same thing as a teenager although each situation is different i had s sibling close in age to me and that was helpful add there was someone else having the same experiences as me from the perspective of the child i guess i would mainly say setting boundaries with your parents if needed is always good dont let them make you a go between messenger a dont let them talk bad about the other parent to you in front of you as no matter what you will always be the other parent and it can cause some internalized conflict other than that stay strong my experience sucked but it made me a better adult in the end and it definitely made me rethink marriage as a young adult so thankfully i didnt jump into anything best wishes i hope everything goes okay

LifeProTips,not_removed,parent here just remember that what happened between your parents is their job to fix and resolve do not take it to heart if one parent disparages the other and do not allow yourself to be drawn to the middle or to take sides every story has two sides and you may not hear how things really went down i would not share what was going on because it was too hurtful for my children so i put up a wall around them sometimes that doesnt work but its what i thought was best at the time this divorce has an end eventually and picking up where we left off involves creating a new future for the family because the old one is gone find out who your parents are as people forgive and let go of your expectations of what a happy family looks like one day youll discover that the love is still there and the ties that bind are intact it just takes time
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had to deal with the same thing personally the best advice is to draw boundaries in what you want to know and not want to know often times they will draw you into arguments or conflict or blame on another to you for me that had bad consequences since it grew as a hatred for both of my parents for me i stopped that by making clear that i dont want them to talk about each other or any romantic relationships they might have also for me divorce was an awesome time to discover better myself and realize that i can stand as an individual and not as part of a family only became more independent and stronger because of that also i dont have to deal with so much bullshit or drama anymore overall the divorce has been pretty positive

LifeProTips,not_removed,i went through almost the identical situation my mistake was pretending it didnt really matter much to me at the time i was at university in another city living my own life for the time which was really just my way of coping in hindsight so please dont shy away from the reality you have to deal with it now for my family it was a disaster because my parents still do not speak years since the divorce my mother still badmouths my father whenever speaking about him my father did not leave her with any financial security the best possible outcome is for the family unit to support each other and ensure that the result is something that ensures you can all be as happy as possible and not fractured bitter individuals

LifeProTips,not_removed,things get much much better mate went through it both parents have their own nice houses now and are both happy so am i
LifeProTips,not_removed,first im very sorry for your pending loss the most awkward part isnt the divorce thats horrible and a grind but youll get through it the thread is full of mostly useful advice but in the end every divorce is as unique as every marriage and youll have to come up with your own solutions if you were younger it might be more emotionally traumatic re your psychological development but youre old enough that it will mostly just be tedious and irritating not scarring what will be scarring is when they start trying to date jesus there is nothing more horrible than a parent trying to date after years they dont know what theyre doing they have a ton of emotional baggage the nature of dating itself has changed and a lot of what they learned and want is completely inapplicable the first time mom or dad brings home an obvious rebound and youre forced to confront the reality that youre clearly better at dating than they are because this is a horrible rookie mistake youre going to want to die mom dripping hormones sexual frustration and confusion is not something any teenager wants to see pray youve moved out by then p or even worse dad starts dating someone way way too close to your age dads tend to date much younger moms same age or older and she wants to be friends
LifeProTips,not_removed,i went through one i struggled with school because i just needed to not be part of it in the end my parents settled things i got better in school went to college got a good job have an awesome wife and a good family couple suggestions i have is to vent appropriately dont use drugs find someone you can talk to that you can trust i suggest someone outside of the family like a best friends parent or a counselor from your school i also would suggest you lay out some rules to your parents on your expectations for instance they should never talk to you negatively about the other they should remain respectful etc i think showing your concerns to them individually and knowing you arent picking favorites should be clearly made to them
LifeProTips,not_removed,they will tell you its not your fault and youll never have to choose between them you will feel guilty sometimes when you see one and not the other on a holiday but remember no matter what they both love you and understand that was my experience anyway and years later is still no different that being said you will get used to it my parents are both ultimately happier which had its benefits
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents didnt split until i was almost but i think this advice still applies make it very clear early on that you and your siblings are not there for them to vent to thats what their friendssiblingsparents are for all it does is make you pissed at the parent theyre venting about and on top of that you resent the venting parent for making you mad at the other i realize it was easier for me as an adult who didnt live with my parents but it will make things much better for everyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,im my parents divorced years ago when i was i lost my house as well and got incredibly depressed the most important thing you should consider is to remember to make sure this doesnt happen to your children for me it taught me that the most important thing about someone is their kindness and openness to talk about problems not what they look like dont fall for that society has no clue what its doing in that regard also your parents still love you that took me a while to realize as well theres much more but i have class in a bit please please do not hesitate to pm me if you want to talk more i didnt have someone concrete to listen to me and i know how much i needed it
LifeProTips,not_removed,my number one tip is to not let either of your parents use you as a therapist or tell you bad things about the other one all of that should stay between them and their lawyers and therapists definitely give and receive emotional support from both of them but if one or both starts complaining at you about the other then youll be much better off telling them you dont want to hear that than learning the horrible opinions they have about your other parent
LifeProTips,not_removed,late to the party here i know but when my parents split up i was and it really flipped things on their head it couldnt have been a worse time as my grades dropped through the floor at the same time and it really messed with my head whats important to know is that your parents are people its a touch lesson but they are flawed and although married mentally they are still just boyfriend and girlfriend the bond of having children and the time they have spent together will never go but people grow apart when they got together they were strangers to each other not born into it because you see them that way an inseparable unit from birth it makes it very difficult to see the separation but just try and imagine anyone you know in school who gets together thats your parents they arent brother and sister the most important advice i could give is not to lose focus on what is important right now for you have some fun but dont go off the rails you will need to be your own guide now as your parents will undoubtedly and understandably lose focus on your wellbeing i got heavily into drugs because of my environment and the opportunity afforded to me make sure you make plenty of time for your studies the world is still a beautiful place that will never change despite how it makes you feel your parents are still your parents they should love you unconditionally lastly this is going to be a trying time you are likely going to see the most ugly side of your parents personality that you may not have known existed be strong they are only human it doesnt last forever and everyone will be far better off once its done ps two christmases baby woo
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is what i do mom im staying at dads tonight ill be at moms tonight days goes and gets completely smashed at a party
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey op i went through a divorce when i was in middle school just gonna share my experience even though i dont think that any divorces are exactly the same my parents had always fought and had arguments but i didnt think they were serious then they told me and my brother on christmas morning honestly i have no clue why they thought that would be a good time to break the news i mean wtf that they were going to get a divorce and that my dad would not be coming with us on a family trip we had planned but would be staying home and moving out while we were gone this was pretty sucky and i was pretty upset for a while then my mom started dating a coworker not too long after the divorce maybe months i dont remember i wasnt sure how to think about that really he was nice but i still didnt feel great about it eventually he and his kids moved in with us he was previously married as well we moved houses and they got married years ago its important to mention that my dad didnt move far away just the next town over so we still saw him all the time and had one night a week plus every other weekend with him he didnt really start dating until a few years after the divorce but eventually did find someone also a coworker previously married who eventually moved in with him along with her kid and they got married last summer the family i had when i was growing up is gone but i gained new families i love my step siblings and my step parents it really sucked the first few months but the thing that helped me get through it the most was that i still loved my parents and ultimately what i wanted most was for them to be happy i remember seeing a facebook post my dad made we werent facebook friends but i looked at what they posted every now and again that read the divorce is final d which at first made me uneasy but made me realize that this is what they both wanted many couples go through an unhappy marriage so they dont have to go through a divorce and make their kids sad and break up the family but im glad my parents got a divorce because now theyre both happy and they still both love me and while the dynamics of my families changed i never felt like i didnt have a home i know not all divorces are like this but the take away is that your parents are doing this because theyre unhappy
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents got divorced well into my i knew it was coming well before that and i respected their reasons for doing it but i will say this as much as anyone will tell you its not about you and such it does still involve you more specifically it is not your fault but it does impact you and you should prepare to self advocate for whats best for you if one of your parents decides that now that they are free of a bad relationship they are going cut loose a bit and maybe spend some extra money on themselves ask them how it will impact their budget if they have a new boyfriendgirlfriend make sure that person is considering you and your future obviously they dont have to be all about you but they should at least be prepared to make you a part of their life likewise learn where your line is on trash talking the other parent otherwise your parents will dump all their problems with the other on you because they think you will understand every now and then remind them that they are both your parents and you are not on either side you are on your own side you have your own needs that your parents need to consider independent of their decision now in the end they are your parents you cant make them change their mind about anything but that shouldnt stop you from voicing any concerns you have at your age you should also definitely be party to knowledge about why the divorce is happening and how it is proceeding above all look out for number one your parents may have had their problems with each other but they still care about you make sure their decisions are considering your future ask tough questions know the facts dont take a side
LifeProTips,not_removed,i really hope they are mature about it if they arent i hope you feel strong enough to point out childish tacticsbehavior sorry you got turned upside down

LifeProTips,not_removed,theres some great advice on this thread so much that i wasnt sure id have anything to add well i guess my experience with my parents divorcing long after i moved out is dont expect it to be easier just because youre older it will hurt you in different ways since youre not a child it wont completely screw with your emotional world but it will affect you for life anyway thats ok have reasonable expectations for yourself and let yourself feel the pain i feel like ranting about my idiot parents divorce now but this is your thread so im heading over to rraisedbynarcissists
LifeProTips,not_removed,my wife and i are going through a rough patch right now we have children who are teenagers and younger the main thing for us is to focus on being parents and friends to each other its better for the kids to have two loving parents who get along than two people who are always arguing and sometimes may not be attentive to the kids because of a foul mood we are trying to be adults about the situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,coming from someone who has been divorced and seen it i know what you are feeling really sucks but try to understand from their point of view they tried for years and it isnt working they are not happy together anymore or there might be extenuating circumstances behind the divorce that they dont want to share with you to avoid hurting your view towards one or both of them such as an affair or addiction of some type please know they love you and it is probably breaking their hearts to seperate after so much time together it will be a very difficult transition for everyone but keep in mind they just want to be happy everyone wants to be happy in life and sometimes things just dont work out like we hoped for be supportive and show love towards both i am divorced and am now dating a divorced woman with kids and its quite a challenge they dont want their mom marrying again unless its to their father there were issues in their marriage and she needed to get out of that in a bad way but will never tell the kids about him to avoid hurting their image of their father she is now stuck trying to make sure they are not hurt by her moving on and at the same time trying to find a personal connection and love again its very sad to see and be a part of i hope it goes different for you and your parents and i wish you the best i know this is not the typical response to a divorce you would normally hear but in my experience my divorce saved me from unhappiness and has brought me to be with this current wonderful woman try to be positive and know your parents are humans too with feelings and needs
LifeProTips,not_removed,im both a teen of my parents divorce and party to my own divorce one truism of divorce and any traumatic event is that the pain that you feel will pass and aspects of your experiences which seem like the end of the world are many times exacerbated by the situation and really arent that big of a deal i promise you that you will look back at many of these times and realize that its not as bad as you think you are your own person granted youre a product of your parents but you are you take care of yourself and keep in mind that this will all be in the past someday granted this is a life changing time of your life but you will get through it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was in a similar situation be prepared for a lot of hate resentment and selfloathing but youll make it out i hated seeing my mom date other guys who were douchebags and idiots compared to my dad i caused my mom a lot of tears for not being accepting of any man she invited into our house i resented my dad for having pursued the exchange student living with us and then other women after my parents tried to mend it i didnt want to see him afterwards because i couldnt stand the thought of him i loathed myself because i felt responsible for their divorce if i hadnt tied them down my dad wouldnt have had a midlife crisis and my mom wouldnt have had a fear of empty nesting i dont know how my brother handled it since he essentially dismissed himself from the family at the time now years later i visit my dad and his wife as often as i can and we talk almost every other day he is a more patient and funloving man than i remember growing up my mom has just finished her years with peace corps in china and she is happier and healthier than i remember in my teenage years i have forgiven both of them and through prayer and patience have become supportive of them and accepting of the situation my wife and i have now been married for nearly two very happy years and having daily analyzed my parents failures has made me a better husband prayer and divine forgiveness is the best way through this pm me if you have any questions
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was when my parents split i cant say how your experience will be i have no idea how typical this was my dad tends to mitigate drama well my brother and sister cried theyre younger so they only knew our parents as our parents i only ever really saw it as a good thing i think im sure there were disagreements but they hid them well but in my mind i was happy for them if they werent happy in their marriage i wouldnt want them to be together the idea of people trying to force something that isnt working sickens me when theres so much more out there to do that being said they werent spiteful theyre seeing other people but live rather close together theyre not particularly friendly but they do keep in contact and my mom still calls my dad to fix things every now and again theyve both set themselves back financially quite a bit selling property like they had during the recovery of a housing collapse was tragic youve got good potential to give perspective if you see them getting spiteful it can help to remind them of whats happening here there was love for however long now their isnt whatever happened in the past they both presumably deserve to be happy refuse to be a pawn actively walk out of any conversation that makes you feel that way literally leave the building and dont forget the real bright side to all of this christmases
LifeProTips,not_removed,im late to the thread so my comment will be buried but i really hope op sees this i have relatively young parents youngest of all my friends i am now they were when i was born they got divorced after years of marriage which made me about its tough at first really tough i dont recall hearing or seeing any fights it just didnt work out between the two of them for you being older youre probably going to hear both mom and dad bitch about one another if that happens just tell them to shut the fuck up and that you dont want to hear it that will put and end to that if it ever starts second do your best to embrace it the beginning is the toughest it feels like your world has been turned upside down you just got to ride it out i promise it will get better it did for me anyway third when or if your parents start seeing other people probably the last thing you want to have on your mind now try your best not to resist it they deserve to be happy as do you now if one of them ends up with someone who sucks dont be afraid to voice your thoughts you will be surprised at how much your parents really respect your opinion just dont be a douche about it
LifeProTips,not_removed,realize that your parents are just people too they are just people like anyone else who tried a relationship together and it didnt work out the woman you call mom is also a woman who has tried to meet men and dated and had relationships and been vindictive and took revenge and was jealous your parents are humans with flaws and weakness
LifeProTips,not_removed,op it is different for everyone i think some of the most basic things youll see is one parent may move often for a while expect some offhand insults of parent a when talking with parent b and vv do not try or let them make you their moderator or gobetween nothing good comes of being the messenger theres more im sure let me know if you need to talk i went through this some time ago when my parents split i was in middle school
LifeProTips,not_removed,personal anecdote my parents split on good terms even though my dad didnt see it coming they were friendly throughout and afterwards but i still took it hard i was so that could have played a role in it but after all this time its just normal how weird it would be to see my parents together
LifeProTips,not_removed,tell your parents to quit being little spoiled selfish shits and raise you first when you move out of the house tell them they can have at each others throat then
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am sorry this is happening to you but stay strong and remember that this is not your fault i remember as a teenager i internalized it and hated myself for years thinking that me being born messed up their marriage looking back i honestly wish they had gotten divorced sooner i spent many days as a kid scared one of them would leave and one day i actually broke down and told them they should get divorced instead of having me and sibling live everyday with the uncertainty now i am really glad they did because it would have been a living hell it will be hard at first but two people that dont wanna be together anymore should split up before shit hits the fan also please dont try to use drugs or alcohol to cope i did that and it messed me up pretty bad for a couple of years if you need someone to talk to you can message me
LifeProTips,not_removed,my tips dont let your parents try to turn you against the other one surround yourself with friends and make them your family
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont let it define you
LifeProTips,not_removed,really a mixed bag ive seen others parents handle it well and mutually split and be grown ups about it my parents are probably the norm of unease at least one is extremely angry unhappy and it may take years to manifest my dad is angry bitter and overall easy to lash out at the world the two cant get along but my mom over time will at least make an effort to be there even if he is where as he almost walked away from my wedding because she came i really hope you have more civil parents and the split is mutual either way you may need counseling and id recommend it since there are emotions youve probably never dealt with that will arise i had a hard time psychologically a few times and managed to come out of it but ive seen it destroy better people than me my best friend was lost to drugs trying to cope with his messy home life and being between two divorced parents living with grandparents my advice if you need help seek it dont be afraid of your emotions and dont look for any easy way out if times get hard
LifeProTips,not_removed,some random advice if one parent is fishing for info on the other dont give them any info youre not comfortable about sharing explain that you need them both to feel that they can trust you and be themselves around you and not to have to worry what youre going to tell your other parent explain that its not fair of them to ask you and if they want info they need to talk to your other parent directly like adults should be the undertone advocate for yourself if you want to get some therapy or to join a support group do it if you dont want to move in the middle of the school year make your preferences known that is not your decision and it may be that finances dictate otherwise but at least speak up when i moved mid school year at as a compromise i was allowed to take the train to visit my friends over the weekends you may find your family is in financial difficulty due to the divorce if so this will be a huge source of stress for your whole family you can help with this examples get a job work more hours sell things you no longer use dont ask for frivolous things try to relay less on rides places if they still drive you around organize to carpool with friends or use feetbikecarpublic transit to get around basically show that youre pitching in to help that will be one less source of stress and conflict for them and hopefully make everyones lives easier
LifeProTips,not_removed,listen to the people in this thread and realize that if your parents are unhappy together then the best thing for your family in the long run is for them to split as a teen you probably dont know how miserable you can be to be with someone you love when you have trouble it is better for everyone in the long run in the short term rely on your friends and seek out good families that can help you that is what i did and i made lifelong friendships as a result with old and young
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents divorced but were good to each other i never felt any issues and spent my time equally between them by choice
LifeProTips,not_removed,if everything goes well you get twice as much christmas gifts but thats the good way to look at it most parents will also compete for your favor and attention source year old parents divorce was finalized yesterday
LifeProTips,not_removed,be as neutral as possible if you can i had the misfortune having to play mediator for parents when they were married and one of them tried to get me to do it when they were getting a divorce i didnt do it and was probably the best choice i made at the time at this point and time they need to settle their differences not you stay out of it if you can and just try to find a place to relax and live your life your parents are human the divorce may bring some unsavory things about your parents but remember we all make mistakes and that includes those that gave birth to us the best thing you can do in all of this is to maintain a good life this means trying to stay social hang with friends or online communities whats up staying busy usually helps get you past these times all the best from someone who was a teen when their parents split
LifeProTips,not_removed,when my parents divorced it was a long time coming they were awful to each other and had attempted to split before but decided to stick together for financial reasonsfor us kids again they were awful to each other they hated one another it took my dad leaving for iraq to start the process of seperation and actually divorcing my mom it was a huge relief that said it was a lot of change to go through my dad was living in another country my family was splitting itself down the seams and i was already dealing with depression and anxiety therapy helped me so much i urge you to ask your parents to find you a therapist you seem to be very upset by all the change thats going to happen and as a teen going through high school and getting ready for college im sure youre already stressed out as it is i know i was what helped me most in therapy was asking for ways to help deal with my stress also it was just nice to vent to an impartial person and cry my eyes out without judgement so tldr version realize that things could be far worse with them staying together and please seek out a good therapist also if you do not find a therapist you like the first time dont be afraid to shop around good luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,pros as a child double birthdays double xmas parents trying to outdo each other by finding out what the other bought you and buying you something better its great when youre a kid and realize this theres nothing you can do to get them back together so you may as well take advantage of it cons typical life will change having to listen to bs from them about each other being the messenger between them my parents divorced when i was took a bit of time to actually grasp what was happening but as a year old youre young and can adapt easier to new situations the worse part from me was being the messenger boy my old man would often hand me a note to give to my mum and vice versa or tell me to tell the other something it was really annoying eventually i just told them to stop and to grow up but still they loved to oneup each other and when i was growing up having double gifts and presents was awesome now many years have passed since then and my parents still talk to each other as friends no hard feelings between them theyve both moved on so you may find for the first few years or so that there will be this negative vibe in the air and unfortunately you will receive the brunt of it all but once they have both moved on and found other partners it will get easier still though the double gifts for your birthdays and the likes dont stop some advice dont pick sides understand that they are both just as normal as you they may both be going through a really shit time right now so try not to interfere or get in the way of their proceedings as time passes a few years or so encourage them to move on if you can dont let them mope around if they are that kind of person help them find new partners if you have that sort of relationship with them you say youre a teenager which age exactly if you are or older then court proceedings for custody wont take place it will be up to you who you want to stay with if this is the case it will be very difficult as one parent might take offense to a decision you made if it comes to it focus your area on your own life and education it doesnt matter what they feel about it what matters for you now is that you can continue going on with school college without any interference dont let their divorce get in the way of your own life
LifeProTips,not_removed,a few things from my perspective as a son of divorced parents its okay to tell your parents off if they try to bring you in the middle but try not to let it affect your relationship with your parents if mom tells you why your dad is such a terrible person remind her that he is your dad never try to be their therapist try not to lose a relationship with either parent and try not to play sides ultimately both your parents are on team you if ever something about you comes up in a fight know its heat of the moment and that there is a twist to the truth enjoy your christmases and birthdays you deserve them for dealing with all this try to be strategic too your parents will likely have different budgets because now they have independent finances usually ill make two lists one that my dad would like buying for and one my mom would like but if i have an expensiver gift then usually i give it to my dad he makes more and can afford more but always make sure you have a big ticket item for both parents even if the price on one is and the other is or similar you dont want your parents to become competitive about gift giving ultimately they are your providers try to ask for a gift from each of them that you can really get excited about and try not to get too excited about the other parents gift also if you have siblings let them know your strategy that way you get the right gifts sorry if this advice comes across as entitlement but it really isnt parents are childish and you need to give them satisfaction of giving a fulfilling gift to buy your love in the end this is the best thing for you your parents and your family and eventually youll have a new normal
LifeProTips,not_removed,so my parents divorced when i was young think around yo and its made me a lot more independent over time it made me realize the difference between a healthy and unhealthy relationship im glad theyre divorced now its allowed me to have two separate support systems which is nice for different things but also makes me want to handle things myself i think it makes you see the flaws in your parents that make them human i didnt notice that until college though it also has completely removed any pressure and desire for me to marry
LifeProTips,not_removed,from a different pov here my parents came close to divorcing when i was they didnt and it was hell i wish they had separated and gotten it over with instead i got years of anger and unhappiness from them they lied to each other they talked shit about each other they were passiveaggressive towards each other they involved me in every one of their fights we had conversations about custody and drug habits and suicide and nothing changed day to day same house same schedule same fights this divorce can be a good thing look at it as a necessary step for the future happiness of your parents its going to be much better than trying to live with two people who have now figured out they cant live together as to the house people move you wouldnt have stayed there forever and its okay to move on maybe go with your parents to find new places to live youll never forget any of the places you live for a long time but youll have a few of them over your life and theyll all have special memories welcome the change instead of clinging to the past
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont let your parents bad mouth one another especially dont let it become a habit for the parent youre gonna be living with if any establish this rule quickly with them if they dont comply just be rude by leaving the room or using headphones each of them has good and bad qualities but its your role to find them and not theirs to angrily expose each others problems its something quite situational but i think that makes a huge difference sorry for i have not read all the other advices and idk if this one was already given
LifeProTips,not_removed,as others have said stay strong get out and hang out with your friends and while it may seem your world is crumbling just remember this happens and it isnt your world its theirs and your world has yet to start stay focused on school friends and family dont make any foolish decisions like resorting to drugs or alcohol your life is only blooming dont forget to talk about your feelings with someone this is a crucial time in your life and while its going to probably be one of the bigger miles stones in your life stay focused on your future op when i was a sophmore in high school my parents got a divorce and it turned my life upside down i went the whole rebellious kid route and made some terrible choices that in the moment were good for the moment but i regret immensely looking back on keep your head up and stay focused on the big picture and your future

LifeProTips,not_removed,hey ive been there im not going to lie how you react to this is probably going to have a huge effect on the person you become in the future this isnt something youll just get over it isnt something youll ever forget and you probably wont laugh about it years later i hope that doesnt sound too bleak but it is the truth of the matter my best advice to you is to find someone to talk to your best bet is counseling but even just a good friend to hear you out is good you feel how you feel about this and its good for you to be honest with yourself and others about how your parents divorce is affecting you bottling up your emotions is about the worst thing you could do right now even if you think its for the best or if you think youre protecting your family by putting on a happy face take care of yourself physically and mentally please feel free to ask me any questions that come to mind my parents divorced when i was and it was a bolt out of the blue wed just been out to dinner and had had a very nice time as a family my parents had come in separate cars due to work and i rode home with dad while sis rode home with mom i sat down in the passenger seat and my dad just playfully punched me in the leg and said welp your mom and i are getting a divorce and that was that years later its still weird to me but the good news is both of my parents are happier and i honestly have a better relationship with both of them now that they arent together
LifeProTips,not_removed,it will be hard but divorce is there for the reason that people arent happy together even though they wont still be together you still have them they just want to be happy for themselves
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wasnt a teen i was at the time but i can tell you that it can be rough depending on how they handle it it will be rough for them but if theyre seeking out divorce its probably for the best best advice i can give make sure you try to stay close with both parents they still want you and they wan to know that you still love them but if they are arguing its best to just walk away and let them handle it
LifeProTips,not_removed,my first question would be how old are you if you are in the age range of you are going to have a bad time here are time tips to get through it dont cut yeah im starting this list of pretty harshly i aint saying you are a cutter nor do i think you are depressed but there are going to be dark days ahead my friend try keep you head up and stay busy dont pick sides take it from someone whos folks divorce was like hiroshiman the bombing in a toilet bowl everything is going to suck now and you are going to want to pick sides dont this is the biggest mistake i have made in my life it doesnt matter if you side with your mum or your dad treat them as equals im not my folks split when i was i used to side with my mother now im living with my dad funny how that goes it does get better after the first few years of upsidedown world things start to normalize out then year passes and things are ok then years passes and things are going good time heals all wounds man even this one its not your fault for whatever reason your folks dont want to be together anymore just remember its not your fault most of the time its a multitude of reason why people dont love each other anymore just stay strong and you can get through this think of the upside no one really sees the positive in divorce but in the end people who dont want to be together are not going to be together this can be a good thing for everyone concerned also xmass presents and birth presents now yay make it snappy if you are old enough and about to talk to your folks the best advice i can tell you is to tell them to get it done asap no fucking around my folks took a good years before everything was settled it got so bad that everyone hated everyone but we were living in the same roof i was sleeping on a couch or sharing a bed with my mother because there wasnt enough room and at one point the cops got called i wasnt there for that luckily i was getting high with my friends hahaha if you have any questions or want to just chat about anything really lord knows you could do with a friend message me ive a veteran of this shit and know pretty much everything these is to know about it ive sat in cars while my mother went to divorce lawyer ive had my dad force me to find out when his caught date was he cant use a computer so ive pretty much seen it all i hope ive been some help to you again any questions hit me up
LifeProTips,not_removed,as depressing as it is this is probably a good thing theyre being pretty honest with you i recommend just telling them both you love them and trying to ride it out maybe talk to each of them about your feelings a bit more maybe seek refuge with good friends and tell your parents theyre your support group
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was when my parents got divorced like you i felt really shocked and like the rug was just pulled out from under my feet i went through the stages of grieving i think i felt mad at first bc of what i felt it was doing to me and what i was losing etc then i was sad a little depressed after a while but i pulled through eventually i graduated high school and got involved in other things like getting a parttime job and starting community college i think doing those really helped me put some distance between myself and my parents issues while providing enough distraction how much you want to do that probably depends on how your parents are acting etc i agree with the comments everyone is leaving about giving your parents patience and understanding because its hard to see how helpful that is in the moment i mean from a parents perspective there is probably no better thing than to hear your kid still loves you and doesnt hate you but at the same time i dont want you to have the impression that you cant feel madsadconfused or cant vent about it you need to do those things too you need to be able to tell your parents at appropriate times like when they are asking how you feel that you are upset or unsure of what is going on in your life its cathartic and they can have the chance to reassure you which you will need too you dont have to be perfect in this process and act like their ray of sunshine all the time bc its not your divorce it is their divorce you are not the mediator and if they make you feel like one at times i would advise you to back away from that and let them know you dont want to be in the middle of it also expect things to be awkward at first around holidays etc it just takes some getting used to but in my experience it can be just as fun strangely there are some benefits to this i know each of my parents much better now i doubt i would have if they were still married i learned from their mistakes because i analyzed the relationship and what went wrong which has made me a little better in my own marriage it also forced me to look out for myself and be independent sooner than a lot of my friends i envied their prolonged adolescence for a while but now i can see that it was a major advantage for me and still is the bottom line is you will be just fine despite how upsidedown things feel right now this is normal you will still be able to reach all your goalsdreams if you want them none of that changes good luck and reach out if you need to ask follow up questions etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,as much as they may want to dont let them talk bad about the other one because itll only drive you away from one of them stand up for your mom or dad to your mom or dad if that makes any sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,call them out when they talk shit about each other youre not there to pick sides with your parents
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents never divorced but sometimes i was envious of my friends who had split parents they seemed to grow up a lot faster than those whose parents were still together i have no idea what youre going through emotionally but it might be good to look on the bright side your parents dont define you and now you have the ability to truly grow into your own person i hope it all works out
LifeProTips,not_removed,double christmas
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you have any siblings watch out for them my brother was at the time and i was emotionally he wasnt able to handle the idea of the family being split up so he turned to drugs it wasnt until it was too late that everyone noticed when the dust settled it ended up being nearly a year crystal meth and cocaine binge with many stints of forced rehab before he finally got clean hes now and is still the mental age of a year old and is diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar unable to work and unable to be in his daughters life im not saying the drugs made him that way but im sure they didnt help as he had no indications of this before he still is unable to cope with the loss and tries to get them back together if i could change one thing itd be to go back and be there for him more instead of being drug in the middle between my mother and father
LifeProTips,not_removed,everyone else really covered this well but i want to add one thing it is not all bad eventually though it will probably take years they will move on then you are truly lucky it took me a long time to see it this way but i now have a lot more people who love and support me than ever before step family etc that being said it took many years to get to this point but youre a lot older than i was so hopefully things wont be as difficult and hopefully your parents will handle things somewhat amicably
LifeProTips,not_removed,if your parents can afford it or if theres a place that offers it free for minors go to counseling this is going to be a strange time and incredibly hard to process routines and rules will probably change and somehow you have to still do the basics of life and pretend like nothing is going on my dad moved me out of my house in between fall and spring semester of my junior year of high school i didnt realize it but i was having trouble keeping up with my regular nonhome life and got very little sympathy from my teachers i wish i wouldve gone to counseling it has affected me so much as an adult i developed this mindset that i work only for myself and i need to only consider what makes me happy hence the reason my own marriage fell apart in less than a year anyway get counseling it will help tell people you trust you will make it through and this is only temporary
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was when my parents divorced after years together it was very difficult to deal with change but try to remember if they are separating it is probably because they are seeking some sort of positive change although it may not seem like it now something good may come out of this keep your head up and try to keep strong bonds with all members of your family this may just create some great ties between you all i know it is incredibly tough but you will get through it and come out stronger on the other side i struggled through my parents divorce because i had little support i hope you are able to use these positive comments to help guide you through this
LifeProTips,not_removed,am going through this same thing worried for my year old siblings
LifeProTips,not_removed,as someone whos watched their parents be miserable spiteful angry and unloving toward each other for my years of life theyre still married and currently navigating how to afford a divorce its better to have two happy parents than one miserable couple i am so sorry about losing the house you grew up in ive had nightmares about that happening and it still might but if you think about it youd be moving out eventually yourself anyway maybe you can buy it back as an adult if its still important to you in the future im also terribly sorry if it came as a shock ive only ever witnessed my parents being mean to each other so divorce was inevitable the only shocking thing was discovering that not all married adults are unhappy and hate each other its important that you know it has nothing to do with you that it will pass your parents will again find happiness hang on for the ride it will be over soon and everyone will be better off for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont let them use you as a pawn in their weird revenge games theyll play on each other
LifeProTips,not_removed,im a little late to the game here but the exact same thing happened to meat the age of ratherand i think i can help my parents had been together for years as well id come to think of them as invincible they werent the only two parents in my group of friends who were still together but sometimes it felt that way everyone got divorcedit seemedthats just what people did but not my parents right i remember crying so hard the day my mom told me she was no longer the one who needed consoling it was like everything i knew was coming crashing down i failed to realizeat the timethat my mom was feeling this i knew things were bad but id never really been through a real breakup at that point and i had no idea what she was going through at the time it appeared my dad was to blame which leads me into my first perhaps onlyif my thumbs get tired piece of advice dont take sides its going to be difficultyou feel old enough you feel like you know whats going onbut you dont im now and i still dont think i completely understand what happened between my parents i did however learn some things along the way that made me regret treating my dad with such distain towards to start of it all they were truly unhappy for a long time theyre your parents to you but at the end of the day theyre people too and they needwant all the same things out of life or a relationship that you or i do my second bit of advice may or may not com into playdepending on how your parents both react to the whole thing in the endbut it pains me to this day that i feel i let my mother down by not helping her move on and encouraging her to try and find happiness when the dust settled she got dumped essentially and she took it pretty hard i expected her to grieve for a whilethat was normalbut the way she eventually reacted by crawling into a proverbial hole wasnt heathy shes nowover years laterand hasnt gone on a single date with another man she gave up she was so hung on the past and so emotionally damaged she was never able to focus on what may make her happy going forward you cant let that happen its not all up to you obviously but you have got to make a point to support them both as people once this is all over now this obviously changes if theyre still hanging around each other andor theres a chance for reconciliation once thats out the window though be there for them in their new normal be kind be acceptingencouraging because one day that crazy bitch your dad moves in with a month after the divorce may become your step mom of and youre gonna have to learn to get along for the sake of the family dont let them wallow in that pity party either theres a million places to meet people online nowadays nobody should have to feel old and alone my mom was at the time she divorced i bet shed kill to have those years back and get the kick in the ass she needed back then to get out and have some goddamn fun dont worry too much and dont blame it on yourself learn from it though dont let the flame fizzle out in your relationships like it did theirs marriage isnt a terrible idea they just may have done it terribly life will go on and things will feel happy again it just takes time hang in there
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents shouldve divorced way earlier when i was instead they waited until i was the reason for that is my father started cheating on my mother when i was and instead of just divorcing and moving on from there he waited to protect us kept it secret he wanted us to still have married parents horrible idea my mother didnt know but the couple started to fall apart when my mother brother and myself learnt of the affair it destroyed everything i cut ties with my father and everything went to shit pretty quick i would have loved a divorce sooner seriously it sucks but it will be best for you in the long run
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am a divorced parent my ex and i separated in divorce final in our son was when we separated the hardest thing to do was to tell him i wish there was any possible way to have avoided that but the honest truth of it was that my ex an i hadnt been happy with each other for a long time i cant predict how things will go for you op i know it was hard on our son even though my ex and i worked very hard to keep him out of the messy business of the divorce and we both sacrificed during the process to make it as easy on him as possible parents behavior during and after the divorce can take a vast array of shapes weve all heard the horror stories at best they will be focused on their own problems and you will feel a bit tossed back and forth and ignored i do know you will be angry you will feel betrayed your world has twisted itself into knots my advice find someone you can talk to find several people who are able to listen to you verbalize and work through your feelings a professional is best but a trustworthy friend will do do not allow your parents to speak badly about each other in front of you they should know better but it is likely they will forget a great bit of advice i got was when you complain or speak badly about the other parent in front of or to your child you are speaking badly about them the child because they are half the other parent not to mention it puts the child in the middle of things do not let your parents use you as a messenger tellask your fathermother should be met with no you do it it is not a fair position for you to be in i did both of those things at least once despite my best intentions i am not proud of it they were mistakes and i learned also do not let yourself become your parents counselor or therapist when i heard of that i was astounded that a parent would do such a thingapparently it is more common than i thought it is ridiculously not fair to you encourage that parent to get their own counseling above all take care of yourself be patient it does get better my son is now he had a rough couple years now he is doing well it did take time though
LifeProTips,not_removed,everyone is sharing stories of bad divorces so id like to share my positive one my parents divorced very cleanly with no hassle and they still talk to each other frequently and we all still get together on the holidays and whatnot my best advice to give is to not get into any of the drama of your parents if their divorce doesnt go smoothly never get in the drama and appear that youre taking a side because it will hurt your other parent deeply
LifeProTips,not_removed,realistically expect to grow up with some serious mental health problems there is nothing you can really do
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive been a child of divorce for a while now and it is exhausting as soon as one thing gets worked out another comes up some parents can continue to work together as parents and not partners very well some others cant its important to always always always tell both your parents what you want make sure that you stand your ground on what you want too as much as everyone wants to believe you do not need to have a reason for anything and you are allowed to change your mind as far as custody goes if it seems your parents are fighting over who gets more time with you remind them that it is supposed to be your time with them not their time with you divorce is a hard thing to go through for any kid at any age because it affects them for the rest of their life i promise though youll be able to get through it
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents were married years and i was when my dad walked out my mom then exposed herself as a crazy narcissist and proceeded to stalk him and slander him every chance she had their friend circle collapsed and they all took sides it turned into a bitter war in the chinese community when i became independent i distanced myself from my toxic mom and my dad left the country to avoid drama as a result i dont have much to do with both parents every divorce is different though
LifeProTips,not_removed,every ones experiences are different but if i were answering this question to my younger self i would say this expect a lifetime free of late nights with parents screaming at each other expect not witnessing relentless passive aggressive comments each day expect no cancelled vacation plans to the beach because of a stupid argument expect not having to run to the police station several blocks away because you think a parent is about to be physically injured expect a sense of feeling safe in your life expect not having difficulties with attachment with adjustment and with basic trust of other people and although this is still possible hopefully you wont have to listen to each parent constantly bad mouthing the other parent when they arent around or constantly putting you in the middle
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a crappy situation and im sorry its happening to you like many who have posted my parents had a long vicious and miserable divorce that i wouldnt wish on anyone what i can say is this be prepared for the bad nights talk to your custodial parent and a good friend about being able to crash there if it gets bad sometimes you will just need some space but if your parent knows where you are going it will cut down on the stress i know you are old enough to just go but dont be surprised if your parents start all of a sudden treating you much younger then you actually are its miserable and suffocating but your parents want to feel like they have control over a living thing and since they no longer have a say over each other the kids get shoved under the proverbial bus dont be afraid to set boundaries dont talk about the house the divorce money or the other parent to either of them putting yourself in the middle will only hurt you long term and even if you dont want a relationship with one of them now you may in the future lastly if you have siblings stick together i cant stress how difficult it is even ten years later when one picks a side my sister became my fathers spy against my mother in court and it was an experience i hope you avoid good luck and best wishes
LifeProTips,not_removed,it really depends on your parents behavior a lot here are sharing their bad stories but its not the worst thing in the world i was close to both my parents so yeah it was a big shock and i had a ton of questions but the divorce wasnt super dramatic or traumatic they just didnt like each other so that was that i live with my mother because i still needed to stay in the area and finish school and my father moved to new york i live in virginia sure i hardly see him but since we were close we kept in touch it was awkward during graduation where both my parents came together for the first time in three years but they behaved my mother told me afterwards that it wasnt as bad as she thought who ever you stay with keep in touch with both because they still care about you dearly i know every family is different but dont fall out with either i hope the best for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,prepare to grow up i dont mean this harshly its just that things like this cause the children to start looking at things from an adult perspective in my experience is it fun certainly not is it painful it can be but at the end of the day your parents like anyone else have to do what is right for them if that means theyre no longer married then so be it i hope its an amicable divorce with no hard feeling between the two parties nothing could be worse than having to choose a side granted the kid usually doesnt get a choice in the matter anyways but ive had a friend or two who had to pick which parent they wanted to go live with

LifeProTips,not_removed,put your happiness above theirs
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not sure why you would marry so young but i wouldnt worry about divorce you have your whole life ahead of you to meet someone new
LifeProTips,not_removed,hello i havent read any other replies in this thread but i have a feeling youre reading them all if youve heard this before then thats fine my parents split when i was i have a brother and a sister that are younger and honestly i think they had a harder time as the oldest i felt a lot of pressure to be the one that kept the morale up and kept things light even though we were going through tough times im sure my family appreciated my attitude but it starts to weight on you being the always happy one i really didnt get a chance to talk about what i was really thinking or feeling this is partially because my parents were so bitter with each other that they only had bad things to say and i didnt want to bring it up i hated my mom for a long time perhaps she deserved a little burn but i held on to it for way too long what was hard for my siblings was they were required to switch schools twice before my mom got settled in her new place also the court case was a total mess they searched and dug up dirt on each other and recorded every little infraction to use against each other in the court if your parents are willing to listen please tell them how destructive this behavior is maybe this is already handled though in your situation now i can say the good parts that came from the split both my parents are much happier dad started losing weight and drinking less visiting mom in her new house felt like an all new life those were maybe the moments i was closest to my mom each house had a little different rules and mom was laid back i never got to see that part of her when she was married dont feel any guilt or responsibility to keep everyone happy it will come as you get older you got this
LifeProTips,not_removed,late to the party but never ever ever become a mediator to your patents bullshit they ask what the other said and you say im not telling and im not getting in the middle
LifeProTips,not_removed,ever since my mom got a new partner when i was like id wished i went to live with my dad they were infantile annoying invasive they were like pubescents again like me except i was an actual pubescent with issues i needed advice for but they could only make fun of every thing i entrusted my mother with my stepdad would announce as a joke at the dinner table and not just about first crushes or my first period though that was tasteless either way i have become completely paranoid and distrusting over those years but they were just having fun with their new life and love i ran away for university when i was to the other side of the country i reconnected with my dad with whom i had completely lost contact for several years turns out we have way more in common the thing is dont let it get to you if this kind of behaviour occurs in one of your parents please try to contact your other parent it will save you a lot of crap also this was my scenario things will go differently for you most likely at least i hope so but nonetheless youre gonna grow up a little faster just make sure to not put the blame on yourself tldr my mom and stepdad became total asshats after finding each other and it fucked me up try to confide in someone you feel you can trust who is not your parent also if your parent says bad stuff about the other dont believe it they most likely say it out of anger towards their ex they dont mean it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i can attest to this wish i had heard something like this when i was in the middle of what op is also going through
LifeProTips,not_removed,the best thing i heard when my parents were separating was that divorce turns parents into children and children into parents this is what i came here to say in less eloquent words they even tried to wait until i was away to college to save me from the stressdidnt work now im an adult and live in another state and theyre living together onoff again practically monthly i still cant decide whether i wish theyd stayed together or apart i just wish theyd of picked one and stuck with it i will note im pretty sure they both have undiagnosed severe mental illness so the volitile relationship i deal with both between them and with me may very well be on the extreme end ureformedunicorn the most important thing is to find neutral parties who are willing to help you through it someone your own age someone ideally from the family who can be at least mostly neutral and someone of adult age ideally your counselor teacher or coach at school that will be able to know whats going on to back you up if you have issues with grades your mood etc and the online crowd is also pretty helpful too when you need to let it all out and get as objective of a view as you can have as youre doing here also know that even though you may not feel like theyre showing it theres love for you and they dont intend to hurt you but dont let your awareness of that love cause you to let slide things if their impact is harmful to you its ok to tell them what the trouble is or even to get away for awhile with one of your support network youre likely going to be forced to grow up fast here and you need to make sure youre practicing selfcare youll get through it and if youre super attached to the house take pictures of everything or find some other way to remember it by but also remember that the memories are ingrained in you not the home
LifeProTips,not_removed,yknow parents are just kids having kids morty edit raising gazorpazorp
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wish someone would have warned me at when mine divorced but as a recently divorced and remarried parent i realize how true this in in some situations interesting
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for this ive been thinking for a long time that my parents were children and it stung i couldnt stand it and wanted them to at least behave like adults like any other couple separating apparently we are all in this together
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents split when i was young maybe about or and this is still true my mum used to be worried that i was too serious and would tell me to stop acting the parent to my younger brothers all the time meanwhile her and my dad still act like children now and i still find myself lecturing my brothers
LifeProTips,not_removed,so well said i was one of those parents who turned into a child ugh its so true this comment is so well said
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow first time i heard that even after my parents split years ago its so true
LifeProTips,not_removed,i really wish id read something like this when my parents got divorced this right here is one of the most sound pieces of advice ive ever heard
LifeProTips,not_removed,well said listen to this guygal
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree with this my parents split when i was or and i had to move in with my grandparents and my little brother my little brother is probably the closest family to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive been through it and you worded it exactly the way it felt
LifeProTips,not_removed,that description ridiculous but so real unfortunately for me im the only child but thankfully i have my grandmother
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes i was in your shoes and your parents my parents acted just like children they wanted to first try and hold onto everything neither wanted to share and they fought over the microwave to the dog my sister and i became best friends and still are today after going through a divorce myself i felt like the person i had invested my future inwith had been fooling me for years she acted in ways i had never seen before i had friends and family to support me but she was my support my parents became new people after the divorce my dad laughed and smiled more in the first years after the divorce than he had in the years i knew him my takeaway was that life is way to short to spend it unhappy or trying to make it work the pain do go away
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents divorced years ago my dad was abusive and left and my mom steadily became her own kind of crazy over the years this was the first time ive heard that saying and i wish i heard it sooner my sister was in college and i was in cyber school for my senior year of high school taking care of my mom through it all i agree divorce oddly brings siblings closer
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents are having a nasty divorce after like years and wow this is so true i needed to read this thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,either you get stronger or you develop anxiety of losing people and end up a stripper in vegas looking for daddy
LifeProTips,not_removed,i completely agree with this my parents act like children and im forced to be the mature one if i spend time with one parent then i have to spend time with the other or they get jealous like little children
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is true my parents announced their divorce the day i graduated the following years i was working multiple jobs and got engaged when i graduated college my mom was constantly switching jobs constantly dating weird guys that none of us kids liked and constantly partying and she still complains about everything i have no advice but to have some grace for your parents they are both going to be hurting and dealing with it in different ways they likely wont acknowledge they have any problems and get mad at you if you point out anything they did wrong in the slightest i too have gotten so much closer to my siblings we were able to vent to each other about our ridiculous parents and that was a huge blessing in disguise
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats the truth parents split when i was and still dont speak to other
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is really really true
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow that is really weird my parents just got divorced after years and i was just telling my friend that i feel like my mother has turned into a teenager and i am having to support her through a high school break up it is so painful and bewildering to have the roles reversed like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey this is really accurate to my parents and siblings as well parents thought it was a good idea to divorce a week after my grade graduation i think im still a bit upset about that plummeted into two years of depression and just feeling sad now im currently almost and yes my brother years younger and i have had to mature a lot faster than most kids and my parents constantly have this stupid tug of war with me and my siblings over the most stupid shit possible like when dealing with kids you just get fed up and tired of the bullshit from them to the point you just dont know what to do anymore soon i will be off to college in about a year and after that i can get away from those two and let them keep tearing themselves apart because they dont listen at all plus my dad is intimidating as fuck
LifeProTips,not_removed,my mom is a perma year old now for over years since the divorceshes
LifeProTips,not_removed,as rthereallroquefort said your parents will act like children at some points so be prepared to be the messenger
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats a sadly accurate depiction of divorce my parents were married years and have now been apart yet still cant be in the same room with one another for more than minutes its pathetic but thankfully i do have two siblings im very close to whom i can joke laugh cry and empathize with over our silly situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,also dont be so quick to believe anything bad they say about each other hopefully they are above it but this sometimes tend to bring out nasty tendencies to try and make the other look worse
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree with you on the siblings part my little brother and me used to hate eachother within a week after the mention of devorce my little bro and me patched things up and we became best friends
LifeProTips,not_removed,there is a gracefull way of handeling this my parents divorced and handled it just fine
LifeProTips,not_removed,and trash talking of the other parent nip that in the bud quick my parents had to both get a talk about how i still loved both of them and i was sick of hearing them trying to bring the other down
LifeProTips,not_removed,and if you are like i was be prepared to be angry and have no idea why it might not happen to everyone but i didnt show any emotion until one day i just got so angry try to recognize it before you let it out on the wrong people luckily for me i did it to some very understanding teachers who new the situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents were divorced when i was little but i still have to be the negotiator and this is very true both will be mad at each other usually but dont feed it just ignore it or dont speak until they stop or blatantly say you dont want to be in the middle additionally never complain about one parent to the other even if its something bugging you itll just throw you into a bunch of unnecessary shit thatll come back to bite you hope this helps a little and good luck with the situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,so much this my parents got divorced when i was and i was angry all the time i would sugesst that you find a person you can talk to an let your emotions out it was not easy for me but it was the only thing that really helped me get other this i wish you the best it is a hard time
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is the worst part of it
LifeProTips,not_removed,fair warning i often still hate both my parents and get annoyed at them really easily
LifeProTips,not_removed,parents are currently going through a divorce and the unexpected anger surges have caught me and my siblings all off guard its weird to suddenly realize youre not angry at one particular thing youre just angry at everything
LifeProTips,not_removed,isnt that part of being a teenager
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is way too true
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the reply i was looking for i was and just starting high such school when my parents divorced it was amicable they still met up for coffee occasionally and they were both far happier which made my life happier i moved between their houses whenever i felt like it they both went on to do amazing things in their lives and im pretty sure without such a traumatic event they wouldnt have been triggered to change edited to add expect that your parents will change in good ways or bad and definitely talk to a counsellor regardless of how you feel you will learn things that you can use in life whenever you do need them i felt fine for the first year or so and then started to feel sad and came up with some weird ideas like that all relationships are doomed i wish i had gone to see a counsellor at the beginning
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is what happened with my parents happened in like grade sophomore in college now and i pretty much just rolled with the punches it was a bit hard at first but once you see that its just a new life you live and their love for you hasnt changed youll learn to grow and live with it now theyre both happy with new sos and i only have more family who i love and loves me back plus the extra christmas and birthday presents help you get by
LifeProTips,not_removed,im in the same boat parents divorced when i was no issues whatsoever never even saw them argue me and my sister spent equal time at our moms place and at our dads place and all of the cotst made raising us would be split between them based on income i actually enjoyed the whole process as my parents divorced i got beds houses birthdays everything looking back on it now i wouldnt have it any other way im now and left the house about a year ago completely happy
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents divorce was really similar to this theyd been together years split up when i was they never fought in front of me but i knew when they were fighting because i could hear the hushed arguing coming from their bedroom i never really asked if any one thing caused it and i dont really want to know my mom met my now stepdad of years around that time but they didnt start dating until a few years later they are both much happier now my dad took it a lot harder than my mom i think hes been married twice since then but they have both been with their respective new spouses for more than years and while theres a lot of driving at holidays mom stayed in the town i grew up in dad moved an hour away from there for work i love them both and am glad they divorced it definitely changed my relationship with both of them as an only child maybe it was just because i was getting older when it happened but i feel like i grew much closer to both of them during that time they both stayed in the same town all through high school and came up with a custody arrangement three days with mom three days with dad that was flexible when it needed to be it worked out ok and i think i turned out ok though i dont have much of a desire to get married
LifeProTips,not_removed,real underrated comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just got divorced dont have any kids with my exwife but i hope we can get along like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah this is great my parents had a really amicable divorce it still took me a long time to deal with my own anger but compared to a lot of peoples they were pretty great biggest thing was continually reminding them that spending time as a whole family was up to them – they had to agree what we did for christmas etc we would just go along with it
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents also have a very clean divorce when i was now it was really hard on my brother and i for the first few years since we moved from illinois to michigan traveling to go back and visit my dad became more and more difficult as we grew older so he started coming to visit us at first he was staying in hotels but eventually he started staying at our house and him and my stepdad got along great now that both my brother and i are out of the house he still goes and stays at my moms house to hang out with my half siblings as he has built a strong relationship with them as well it drives my mom a little crazy from time to time because my dad actually vacations in michigan at our house but she has always told me that she will remain close friends with my dad because she always wants him to be in my brothers and my life
LifeProTips,not_removed,my experience was quite similar there was certainly pain hurt feelings and all the normal stuff but my parents still care very deeply for each other we have holidays together they each bring their new sos and they get along quite well its not perfect and there have been some tricky situations to navigate but overall my parents are much happier separate than they were together one of the advantages of them breaking up when youre a teen is that you understand it better and you have probably seen some of the dysfunction for me it felt easier than id imagined because i could see how much better it was for them to be apart
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had the exact same experience
LifeProTips,not_removed,exactly you saved me the effort of writing this
LifeProTips,not_removed,super legit comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,same
LifeProTips,not_removed,this right here is a pretty good comment thanks for taking the time to help out op and other people who might be reading rlifeprotips
LifeProTips,not_removed,i asked my siblings if they would like to make a video with me going room to room and talking about some memories we have for each part of the house i think that will help us to appreciate the house and cope with losing it this is such a good idea my parents while not getting divorced are selling the home theyve lived in for almost years my youngest sister has had more of an emotional time accepting this than i have and i think this would be an awesome way to preserve the memories of our many years there thanks for the brilliant idea
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would also recommend trying to avoid becoming the person your parents vent to about the situation a divorce is easier if you are able to continue your relationship amicably with both parents this very very much this if they try and vent to you learn how to politely point out that they should have a counselor that they talk to and that they dont make them your sounding board its a hard thing to manage theyll both be sensitive about things and want you to understand their and only their side and it might hurt their feelings if you dont do it politelynicelygently but its very important as it will help you maintain a good working relationship with both your parents if you dont youll end up seeing one side more than the other letting their gripes and feelings colour your relationship with the other parent my sister doesnt talk to my dad and hardly to me as her mother did this to her at the start she would tell her mother to stop going at it with my dad its very very hard to cope with later on
LifeProTips,not_removed,one or two sessions with a psychologist is always a good idea if a friend is going through something and you dont know how to help or what to expect of yourself ive done it when my dad has had a freakout when parenting gets too much for me whatever should have done it when a good friend was suicodal instead of acting like a brat but you live and learn
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup get some counselling yourself so youve got a space to vent about stuff and suggest this to the parents as well so theyve got the same it gives everyone a neutral third party who will do the listening thing so people around wont have to carry that
LifeProTips,not_removed,its interesting to see how dealing with a parents divorce is similar and different for me i was relieved my parents were getting a divorce they always had heated arguments at night and it was making me crazy my mom told me with her head low that my dad and her were getting a divorce and all my self said was good but interestingly they didnt start overly venting to me about each other until i was planning my wedding i listened to both of their first rants but after i told them im not going to be listening to their shit talking anymore i shut my dad down as soon as he started blaming my mom for her premature birth of my late brother my dad is a whack job sometimes and i was glad to not live with him anymore
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is very helpful thank you for sharing your thoughts and making this messy complicated situation a bit more digestible
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wish i had known how to navigate my mothers need to vent i was when my parents went through a really rough patch my dad slept with my moms best and only close friend she turned to me to vent and i was unable to find a way to communicate how uneasy that made me i felt like she had no one else to vent to years later i realize she had many other people to vent to the worst part is they didnt even get divorced and decided to work things out needless to say i dont have a very good relationship with either of them after hearing all that happened its hard to respect either one of them
LifeProTips,not_removed,you and i have basically had the same life and yes yes yes to not becoming your parents confidante they have friendstherapists for that you are their child love them but do not let them put you in a role that would require you to hear bad things about the other parent i had to go no contact for months because my mom refused to respect this despite me asking her multiple times to not shit on my dad in my presence she finally got the picture and we are healing divorce is one of the worst things but you will move on and find a new normal
LifeProTips,not_removed,this this this my parents divorced before i was three but i had to deal with custody issues until i was about fifteen i turned to weed for support since both parents were trying to pit me against the other i learned the hard way that if done excessively it can really hinder your progress in life not saying its a hindrance for everyone but it can be if abused and yes it can be very addictive
LifeProTips,not_removed,this times a thousand parents divorced at the divorce combined with my dad having custody with some kind of severe bipolar and some other shit too also untreated led to me chipping china white alone in my room for a couple of months led to me snorting before school some days before i could put an end to it moved away from dad permanently and did a in life basically long story life is alot better now but day to day life is definitely alot harder than it should be for a year oldi think comment got a lot longer than i planned got a tendency to drift off and ramble a lot due to my add combined with a large high dose of vyvanse and no sleep in well this is the result again rambling to make this comment atleast a little valuable and not just a mindless rant about how my life sucks life can always get better and it will if you want to it is what you make it out to be should add that i have tremendous respect for mental illness even if i came off a bit rude when explaining dads mental state but it really feels like his fucked up brain is one in a billion and i cant help but get a little pissed off att life when thinking about it the way psychiatrists has explained it to me and my siblings is that a symptom of his bipolar is that he is too sick to realise it im done now felt surprisingly good to talk about this with noone thank you internet love you if anyone has any idea what this too sick to realise it symptom is called please share been trying to find info on it but to no avail the psyciatrists basically explained it to us like it was a post kinda sucks
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,this my parents divorced when i was and i still have trouble with expressing my feelings and acknowledging them i still am the gobetween and it wears on you find some support if you think you need it none of my friends understood because their parents were all married or had clean divorces write things down even if you throw them away because its releasing your anger i have never used drugs for coping but dont get yourself in that space
LifeProTips,not_removed,this right here op your parents are likely to do out of character things actions youd never expect them to do i remember the crushing moment not long after my parents divorce of realizing how infallible they are im ashamed to say i thought they were perfect and for way too long theyre people and people screw up especially in times of high emotion and significant change does that mean you shouldnt hold them accountable no if they are putting you or any siblings in danger abusing you or even just messing with your head by pitting you against the other parent speak the fuck up but also realize that theyre not superheroes or gods youre going to see them vulnerable lonely possibly heartbroken its not fun its not pretty but its a lot easier to handle if you recognize and remember that theyre flawed human beings who make mistakes just like you and i good luck if you need someone to talk to pm me also consider asking your parents for therapy to help you and them through this a neutral third party can really help you process and understand whats going on around you
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed some people shouldnt be together my parents hated each other my mom hated being poor and lumped a lot of shit on my dad he was a quite man who was well respected in our old country but was struggling to build a business here they both worked hard and took care of us but the combination of all of this drove a wedge between them when i was they got into such a huge fight that he hit her he was not a violent man coming from a country where you teach your woman manners he never struck her before but this time she just didnt back down and kept shouting at him suddenly i hear her scream and my siblings and i looked and saw that hes knocked her to the ground then he grabbed her and dragged her out the main door then he said something that pretty much fucked up my life if it wasnt for you guys i would have left her a long time ago he climbed into bed then and closed the curtain we let our mom in and everyone just sat there op i hope your parents can come out of this ok but you know sometimes its better to get out of hell
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol assuming people like me are flawed
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you for the advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would love to set those boundaries with my mother but she has no family and due to the domestic violence shes been through the past years she has close to no friends and no family left she only has my sister and i and ive tried telling her that i really dont feel comfortable hearing it she gets really hurt that after all i do for you youre not willing to just listen to me vent i feel really appreciated thanks then she starts venting to my sister about me sorry turned into an unexpected rant
LifeProTips,not_removed,this was the biggest issue that affected me during my parents divorced not specifically from parents but from my parents family i heard some terrible accusations from both sides of the family id second the idea that if anyone starts talking about the other parent gracefully excuse yourself if they cant understand they arent worth your time
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hated that phrase your motherfather while rarely used in spite gave a glimpse into the anger and bitterness that was otherwise kept pretty well hidden from me
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents have been split since i was a baby and i still get the your mom this or your dad that tune it out because its not worth hearing something petty and stretcheduntrue about the other parent out of their own rage and not knowing what to do ugly crying is a good option and feels good until you get why are you crying its nothing to cry over crying feels good sometimes especially through one of these situations
LifeProTips,not_removed,except for the parts of you that remind them of their ex
LifeProTips,not_removed,idealistically and probably i dont want to say they dont love you because of the time they do but i also dont want to lie for the sake of making someone happy they almost always will love you theyre youre parent and at the very least theres some instinctual love and at the most they honestly do love you for being you and not just their offspring however in my parents divorce quoted because they were never married so it was more literally a separation there was a total disconnect where they both hated each other and turned me against one another and left me to deal with the consequences i was never a child i was a tool for them to use against one another this obviously is a common story please stay positive and realize none of this divorce is your fault but if worst case scenario you end up like i did please dont let them use you and be your own person otherwise follow most of the advice in this thread its good general advice but dont be afraid to ask for more help if you need it cause youre parents are shitbags hopefully not though anyway youve got love here be strong
LifeProTips,not_removed,but do they im just kidding
LifeProTips,not_removed,people pleaseryes man here as well it took me many years to have the guts to give my own opinion and it boosted my previously weak confidence i experimented and got some things right and some things wrong but overall i finally caught up to everyone
LifeProTips,not_removed,if anyone makes you feel like there are sides be sure to share how that is affecting you they may not realize they are doing it
LifeProTips,not_removed,my advice is seek therapy anyway – you probably wont be sure you need it until youre way past the point if that makes sense just go to a therapist tell himher your parents are splitting up and youre here just in case and theyll take it from there
LifeProTips,not_removed,not to one up ops situation but i agree with this sentiment that if the parents relationship has broken down a divorce can be a good thing my parents have had major issues since i was little my mother had more prowess in career and life than my father and did not understand the importance of supporting him emotionally against his feelings of inadequacy my father turned to mistresses and lavish spending abandoning any attempt to be breadwinner and man of the house years into the bitter relationship they havent divorced yet but i still wish each day that they do asap growing up when i was with dad dad would talk shit about mom and vice versa it was confusing and i still wonder what the truth was who truly said what did dad really steal so much money from mom is mom or dad the bad guy except instead of this happening more frequently for a few years and tapering off as the divorce becomes old news i still hear new offenses that dad has committed to make mom heartbroken dad is constantly owing debt everywhere and hoping mom will pay it for him to prevent her apartment from being taken by court and to be honest some days i just cant care to hear more ranting about how mom feels about dads mistresses
LifeProTips,not_removed,summed my life up my mom had me convinced my dad was an abusive lying deadbeat ten i turned and started working for him and found out none of it was true i remember their fights it wasnt a one sided best down like she said normally she hit him first and then it was on i hate thinkin about those years i thought he was a bad person i hate that somehow she still gets child support in a joint custody agreement but i still love my mom i just think sometimes she likes hurting my dad more than she likes caring about me
LifeProTips,not_removed,im so sorry to hear your parents divorce was so messy but i admire your fortitude im looking at something similar with my family in that i cannot picture my parents even laying eyes on each other again its pretty recent but theyve been fighting dirty and lashing out at each other all my life and honestly even though i love them id be a fool to expect any better from them however im still struggling with the idea that two people who loved each other had a family together shared a life for so long could be reduced to this may i ask you if you went through something similar and how you managed it in any case congratulation on your wedding its gonna be your day no matter what dont let them distract you too much
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes to this a journal gave me space to breathe especially because i didnt have many people to go to parents told me not to tell anyone they told me it was fine to write in a diary you can also put your own password if you want to have it on your pc recordings might also help depending on your situation if you dont want to writedont have enough time
LifeProTips,not_removed,hi i just wanted to say thanks for taking the time to write a helpful comment for op and others who might be reading im not at all religious but i love seeing how much church can help people so thanks for contributing to the sub
LifeProTips,not_removed,reading your comment i wanted you to know that odds are you are the joy of your parents lives i dont mean that in a heavy way but in the sense that you are what keeps them going when i lost my daughter stillbirth i was naturally very traumatized and the single thing that kept me afloat was my son who was at the time honestly he is why i kept breathing why my husband and i made an effort to heal together i also had another son after my daughters death and he is just icing on the cake he will never replace my little girl but i have always felt that he is my extra measure of joy the sun after the storm i think your parents understood that in the darkest time of their lives they needed light and that light is you
LifeProTips,not_removed,atheist here and i really wish there was some nonreligious community structure that could have this same function ive actually joined in on church groups a couple of times just because its so darn comforting to be as welcome as you are in a good church so if op is religious maybe this is a very good idea to seek out a community outside of and larger than the family somewhere safe supportive and stable
LifeProTips,not_removed,and im from a single parent family dad left when i was or something weve immigrated to canada then my dad cant stand doing labour and went back home and found a lover my mom couldnt handle a kid and work and everything by herself in a foreign country so we ended back home also i havent seen my dad much ever since and everything that happened just makes me love my mom more than anything in the world my dad gives up on a daughter and i give up on this dad thing so i call it a even
LifeProTips,not_removed,i remember being a teen when my parents got divorced one night i walked in on my mom crying in bed telling me how she wishes she could have peter pand it through life cause sometimes life is hard it was that moment when i realized my mom was really a person with feelings and not just super hero mom
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow wish someone had typed this to me in high school while my parents hit a rough patch very well explained
LifeProTips,not_removed,awesome comment exactly what is needed
LifeProTips,not_removed,agree my parents almost divorced and they both confided in me crying apologizing that they messed up and shouldve been a better role model i just stopped them right there an told them that i love them with all my heart and that would never change i understand that they are only human and i cant say that a divorce may or may not be the besy thing to do but to always know that theyll never lose me
LifeProTips,not_removed,this needs a xpost to rbestof well said
LifeProTips,not_removed,brilliantly explained and worded
LifeProTips,not_removed,broke up with my wife this sums it up perfectly thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,great advice my parents split when i was i sat with each of them and told them i was there for them but didnt want to hear anything about the other parent from them that was years ago and we have since talked about it in the heat of the moment though people tend to embellish and not filter things
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive always strived for the understanding that you offer and articulate so succinctly
LifeProTips,not_removed,i cant say i can relate to a child dealing with a parents divorce but damn this really put it in perspective for me incredibly well said sir
LifeProTips,not_removed,damn my parents split years ago and this just really helped for some reason thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,beautiful approach i hope more people get to this
LifeProTips,not_removed,well put thank you for the thoughtful response
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats so sweet sad depressing best comment ever im going to save it maybe i wont need it but just in case
LifeProTips,not_removed,truer words have never been spoken
LifeProTips,not_removed,that was a really good comment before i left for college my dad told me that when i get back him and my mom might not be together anymore it was really stressful but i am happy to say that they are doing well and are happy together again
LifeProTips,not_removed,this this is perfectly said when my parents split up i took this mindset i told both of my parents that i was going to look at it this way they were both happy i did because they could be honest to me about it without thinking they would be influencing me to take sides
LifeProTips,not_removed,i typically dont comment on such serious topics but i need you to know your comment brought me to tears this is exactly what happened to me when my mom married my step dad and the entire time they have been married if i ever tried to let her know that he was hurtful or insensitive my mom told me to quit being so dramatic and to be grateful you finally have a dad since yours was such a piece of shit as an adult i see the way my spouse treats our daughters and it brings me to tears often because i cant believe that this is what i missed out on my entire life he tells my children they are beautiful and smart and he just completely envelopes them in love and i am so sad that it took me nearly years to witness that and only makes me hate my mother more for allowing me to believe that my step dad was what a good dad is he wasnt he still isnt i am sorry you went through this i am sorry we went through this
LifeProTips,not_removed,yup same my parents split when i was and although we were already fledgling adults my brother and i still felt this to a remarkable extent its been more than years and with both dating again i feel were just reaching the worse before it gets better part it helps to hear others have felt similarly
LifeProTips,not_removed,parents got divorced about a year ago this is great advice to ureformedunicorn remember that their divorce isnt your burden dont play the mediator dont try to keep things fair between your parents thats their lawyers job if youre stressed about it now trying to be an active participant in their divorce will destroy you the turns parents into children bit is great but to be more specific your parents will revert back to the people they were before they got married theyre going to try to figure out how to navigate life solo and the only way they know how is the way they did it back in their be patient with them and give them a year to find themselves eventually they will return to the same old people you know and love
LifeProTips,not_removed,edit raising gazorpazorp dont play with my emotions like that i cant fing wait for season
LifeProTips,not_removed,you sure you dont mean
LifeProTips,not_removed,ugh this my parents did this and i was when they divorced im not sure if it was better or worse to deal with their separation as i hadnt lived with them for years didnt care who got the house and wanted to remain neutral on one hand im glad i didnt have to deal with that kind of talk as a teenager but on the other hand as an adult i lost a lot of respect for one parent specifically and their shit talk at first i didnt say anything thinking i was being supportive by letting them vent i wish i had made it clear from the start that i had zero interest in taking sides or listening to them disparage each other
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah this can be really annoying they basically force you to pick a side its like having two children going please say im right and im your favourite
LifeProTips,not_removed,alsothis sort of thing can last it was years later that i got help through therapy and realized i was mad at my whole life growing up but taking it out on those around me also eventually you get to be an adult but you still feel angry over this shit thats ok being an adult and mature means recognizing your own feeling and failings and working to make them better
LifeProTips,not_removed,to add on to this learn to find you your heart your anything just you youll need it and remember you have everyone here to listen to any of your emotions
LifeProTips,not_removed,my parents divorced when i was an adult years of marriage and i got angry all for purely selfish reasons though my mom moved further away and this made me upset because she wouldnt be able to see her grandchild as much and couldnt babysit as much dividing up thanksgiving and christmas would be even more difficult now already difficult between parents and inlaws and seeing my dad date someone else was hard too that started years ago ive gotten used to it by now its become sort of my new normal im kinda thankful that they didnt get divorced when i was still living at home i know that probably wouldve meant moving schools and switching between homes every now and then i remember when my dad got his first girlfriend after they got divorced and it just bothered me so much i hardly talked to her and my dad noticed he asked me to be nice and hug her i tried my hardest but i also felt like i shouldnt have to do any of those things as long as i wasnt outright rude anyway i got used to him having girlfriends if thats what he calls it every time i visit him he has a new one ugh hell be next year and hes either a player or a terrible boyfriend its so weird my mom hasnt dated anyone since the divorce or at least as far as i know anyway what was my point i guess that you will probably be angry but the anger subsides after time
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is so true parents divorced when i was seven and ive spent my whole life being the middle person when they had conflicts because they refused to talk to each other its gotten to a point where its not as bad anymore and theyll speak they even flew across country and stayed in a hotel together to visit me a year ago but they still have trouble getting along can attest to not complaining about the other as well as a child id naturally tell each one when something was bothering me about the other which would always lead to a bunch of you dont need to be around that you can just move in with me full time or youre not required to go visit him if you dont want to just stay home with me all of which never solved anything and only caused more conflict
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep parents split when i was and i still have to watch what i say around themnegotiate between them years later
LifeProTips,not_removed,dude my dad cheated on my mom over years ago ironically me lying to my parents was the one thing that was a beating offense some days its all i can do not to throw it in his face
LifeProTips,not_removed,broken home anger is different its an allconsuming rage and a sense of loss that takes a long long time to wear off
LifeProTips,not_removed,not if both of your parents love you together
LifeProTips,not_removed,not to disparage counseling by any means but i think i only learned good things about relationships by seeing my parents end i dont think comfort is enough to maintain love i generally think marriage is a bad idea the idea of getting a legal contract involved in relationships will never make any sense to me what i saw was two people who loved each other but werent in love with each other there were good years and then a lot of waiting for the relationship to get uncomfortable enough to break legal and family binds ive never expected a relationship to be doomed to fail but i always keep track of where my feelings lie i wont try to force commitment where it shouldnt be and loss of love does not have to mean loss of connection just because the way you interact with a person changes doesnt mean its over or even that its worse but being ready to adapt around changing dynamics with the people i care about has mitigated a lot of pain over the years
LifeProTips,not_removed,i recently got remarried in much the same childless circumstance i on the other hand try to avoid she who must not be named as if she had the plague
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hope i never divorce but if it did happen i would strive to be like your parents my husband and i are best friends were friends before we dated and i couldnt imagine us not being friends even if we would split not that divorce isnt hard or that there are never hurt feelings and maybe some anger but after it is all said and done there should be no reason to keep up the hatred it would be exhausting and prevent everyone fron healing and moving forward your parents are classy people i dont know them but they have my respect
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am surprised this is not the top most reply up voting
LifeProTips,not_removed,make another video walking through the house when its empty or when people are there walk different paths back and forth you can have people in there then they can play along just saying hi or something short try this a few times nowadays it doesnt cost much so make make like minutes of this and then edit it later into one nice movie
LifeProTips,not_removed,of course good luck i know it is tough
LifeProTips,not_removed,i once had my dream house i loved everything about it and was more proud of it than anything i had ever had when my ex and i split up she got it due to a number of factors that were completely fair even though both our names were on it for awhile i was really upset about it but you know what ill have another house some day ill be proud of that house too ill make memories there as well dont get caught up with where you used to be all those memories dont go away just because youre not there anymore
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is what i came here to say be strong and firm that you dont want to be a messenger between them and that you dont want to take sides you might not know the reason for the divorce fully and maybe neither do your parents my parents divorce was quite clean and they didnt talk to me or my sister about each other which is probably the reason it went really ok now years later im finally beginning to understand why the divorce had to happen and what my parents felt about it and eath other
LifeProTips,not_removed,friendly neighborhood pothead checking in weed can absolutely be mentally addictive more than that your brain isnt done developing until its or so when you smoke at whatever youre sabotaging your brain in a way that will actually fuck you up for the rest of your life friend toke yo but please please wait until your brain has finished developing

LifeProTips,not_removed,hey there i have absolutely no idea what type of bipolar disorder your dad has but i think i may be able to explain a bit about the too sick to realise part first a warning i am not a professional in anything so please dont hate me if i say something wrong feel free to correct me though as you probably know someone with a bipolar disorder has periods of being depressed but also periods of being manic i have some experience with bipolar people and what the dsm v the big book of mental illness explains about the manic periods is that people no longer think straight a friend of mine is bipolar and turns into a huge asshole when manic its like im talking to a completely different person i asked him once about it and he said that somewhere in the back of his mind he knows that what hes doing is fucked up for example he has terribly hurt some of his friends by saying major asshole things to them playing around with cocaine pissing on a cop car but he somehow just doesnt register it and most importantly doesnt care at all he only realises what hes done when he eventually snaps out of his manic period of course by then its too late again i dont know what happens with your dad when this happens these manic periods are different for each person some people can go into psychosis some people just spend excessive amounts of money some people are suddenly convinced they can fly then theres the depression part this is where i have personal experience and this is the other part of too sick to realise id like to tell you about i have had depression since i was about ten years old so i have been this way for the most part of my life of course i realise im sick but i cant feel that im sick this is what i know this is my normal i couldnt explain to you what generally happy people feel i only know that the way i feel is not how its supposed to be i think if someone cast a spell on me taking away my depression id be horrified i would not have a clue what the hell is suddenly wrong with me for i do not know normal i think normal would feel very weird and very wrong for me simply because i wouldnt know what im dealing with this is the part where i dont realise how sick i am for me its normal to hate myself to feel miserable to be afraid to talk or befriend someone because id just annoy them its completely normal for me to want to hurt myself or worse to bully myself with every negative thing i could possibly think of when this is normal for you theres a huge fucking chance youre too sick to realise just how sick you are i hope this is somewhat of an answer for you please take good care of yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,that sounds awful that must have been pretty traumatic to watch how did you kids cope with something so sudden and violent like that and how do you think his words changed you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i can understand this my parents are divorced and my mom and i are best friends i dont mind her venting to me a little bit as i do the same to her but sometimes it is too much i just have to cut her off and say this is not something that i want to know and kind of reestablish the parentchild relationship edit also wanted to say sorry youre going through this my parents divorced when i was and for years i was very upsetangry about it and jealous of my friends whose parents were still married looking back i am so happy they finally got divorced instead of staying together for my siblings and i they are two people who never should have married in the first place and are much better people when they are apart it sucks but it helps me to think about it as two incompatible people breaking up vs my family falling apart
LifeProTips,not_removed,was your father a good father to you i ask because i had slightly similar circumstances no domestic violence but my father definitely was not good to my mother but for the most part was a good dad to me i was able to get my mother to stop complaining about my father to me by getting her to recognize that while he was a bad husband he was still a good father and i deserve to be able to view him as such
LifeProTips,not_removed,setting healthy boundaries is the kindest thing you can do for her she will flip out at which point you walk awayhang upwhatever several times and if she doesnt ever get it thats not your fault enabling her isnt doing any of yall any favors
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre just like your father thanks for the emotional abuse mom
LifeProTips,not_removed,which for my mother was everything we now have no relationship
LifeProTips,not_removed,for sure my mum let me know at that i wasnt old enough to know the whole story dad had an affair or a dozen dont know dont care he wasnt well anyway and in doing that reduced the divorce to hes wrong im right as if it would have been smooth sailing if hed kept it in his pants childish attitude of hers at the time so even though she was trying so hard to be grown up about it we knew what she really thought and lets just say it was distressing as a teenager you have the means to defend yourself from that accidentally passive aggressive contamination
LifeProTips,not_removed,youre welcome if it can help someone just once then it was worth writing it up i know some great people who are not religious and they have basically everything going for them huge house awesome cars long vacations beautiful wife but you know i realize that they are never truly satisfied i wish i could get them to try church but i can see why they dont go why go to church when you seemingly already have everything you need in life perhaps it is only when you are in need of help that you seek it unfortunately by then it is sometimes too late
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow this made my eyes shimmer and you know what you are right my mother has explained to me countless times almost exactly what you said that it is my birth that kept them going i didnt mention it earlier but my mother asked her doctors about having another child she was at the time they all recommended against having another child as it could be detrimental to the mother and newborn and the possibility of birth defects would skyrocket because of her age either by amazing coincidence or perhaps an answered prayer she said i was her easiest pregnancy and that i never really got sick as a child and rarely cried compared to other kids and to be honest what kept me going sometimes was that i knew of the broken hearts my parents had already experienced and i couldnt put them through another loss what gives me the most strength to continue and make better decisions is my ultimate goal to someday meet my sister for the first time in heaven i know thats not going to happen if i take my own life and thanks to some mild medications i can control my anger and depression very well i can also say i enjoy life now i wouldnt say that years ago i would almost say that a person like me going through depression is pathetic seeing as i had mostly everything handed to me growing up i eventually realized that some kids at my school didnt have money for lunch others whose father left them at birth are in jail or worse it helped give me a new perspective on life and to be thankful for what i have and to give back now if only kim k could realize that
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow thats awesome you took part in a few church groups i guess to take part in discussion and see what its all about to see other peoples views and to share your own talk about stepping outside your comfort zone i bet those you interacted with were happy to have you even if they dont share the same beliefs think of how the world would change if everyone would accept anothers beliefs and not act out their differences with violence but just a friendly conversation we can only dream i think i remember reading in revelation that when the end times do come those that believe in god will be such a small percentage of people on earth because there will be so many different radical religions that no way resemble christianity but most will simply not believe in god whats somewhat alarming and perhaps backs that up is in college i learned that those aged are stopping going to church at a rate that is greater than ever before so when they have children and they arent going to church i would bet that those children and their future children would also not have that much great of an interest to go oh well doomsday could happen tomorrow just with the same amount of chance as it could happen years from now im ready though i would like to be able to drive a lamborghini before that happens lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,i realised this same moment when i was really mad at her for selfish reasons and i went outside to sit on the curb i was crying because i thought she was hurting my dad on purpose and she sits right next to me turns my face towards hers and looked at me in the eye and said im just not happy baby and i dont know why that was the sentence i needed but i immediately went from a selfish year old to an instant adult for my mom i get teary eyed thinking about it now because as a kid you dont usually have the abilities or want really to understand things on that level when in fact your parents need you to be but they wont ask you to be its not easy explaining long term relationships with kids who have never experienced it
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck im an only child and that was one of the toughest moments of my life discovering my parents are human they do their best but theyre only human
LifeProTips,not_removed,parents are people with kids
LifeProTips,not_removed,a person with feelings and not just super hero mom as dave attell said best you spend your whole childhood thinking your dad is superman until one day you realize hes just a drunk who wears a cape
LifeProTips,not_removed,he should get gold
LifeProTips,not_removed,i understand where you are coming from except my anger was with my father i have some time and experience on you and can tell you one thing stop wasting your energy on the past you have no control over it and you cant change it be the mother you wish you had love your husband for the father he is the anger and sadness takes away from enjoying every precious moment i dont know you but im willing to bet that your children will not feel the same about you and their daddy be proud that you broke the circle i know it dosent mean much but im proud of you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i recognize what youre saying i dont have kids yet but i feel certain things so hard when i look at parents of my friends and my boyfriend i see the love and support and i just know i havent had that im still only though and most of my friends parents basically assume me to be one of their own especially my boyfriends mum she really is the mother figure in my life now for me the issue was that i had anything material that i wanted toys clothes bicycles whatever i wanted they would buy and more but other than that i had nothing i will always feel like i cant complain because they gave me so much they would tell me i was ungrateful as soon as i opened my mouth about getting laughed at that i was a pussy and weak for not getting the joke the thing is that they werent a ground for me to stand on they were not the soil from which i could grow if anything they were the pesticide the way they acted made me feel i deserve nothing and now whenever someone does something for me i feel the immediate urge to do something in return as to not feel guilty for accepting especially for birthday presents i hate my own birthday now we went through this stuff but look where we are now were both in a good place with good men by our sides and a bright future we broke the cirkle as said somewhere in the thread we got this we have too much love to give for it to be swallowed up by our past we wont let it
LifeProTips,not_removed,your mom may not know herself what good parenting looks like
LifeProTips,not_removed,youd probably recover faster if you stopped dating your brother
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh mine straight up became children one night my mother was sitting on my bed crying apologizing and thanking me for suddenly becoming her mother and being wise beyond my years my dad interrupted afterprom to bring me home because he had just had another big fight with my mom and needed my support years later they flip between me parenting them again and then acting like none of that ever happened and treating me like a childcalling me disrespectful if i dont give them their way they never really grew up before they got married as they did it very young
LifeProTips,not_removed,me too i keep getting articles on my google app feed that say cruel things like season to be aired sooner than you think and such shit
LifeProTips,not_removed,sctually is tiny rick bitch
LifeProTips,not_removed,i promise to call you whenever i need money or i have to do laundry summed up my relationship with my parents right after i moved out
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is called parental alienation its a major problem in divorces these days and fathers rights groups are doing everything they can do to stop this the majority of the time it is used against the noncustodial parent as a tool to further the divide between them and there child
LifeProTips,not_removed,honestly you shouldnt be forced to show affection ever hugging seems unnecessary and it isnt right for your dad to expect that especially since you are old enough to make your own decisions if you havent talked about how you feel with him i highly suggest it but you also have to remain very open minded and listen to everything he says even if you disagree or you can ignore all of my advice because im just some college kid but i always encourage trying to mend or strengthen relationships with your parents while they are still there
LifeProTips,not_removed,what finally got me to calm down after many many years was the realization that its better to be from a broken home than in one
LifeProTips,not_removed,sense of loss thats the perfect wording
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont think this is something simple enough to say youll experience it if this and you wont if this every persons experience and reactions will be their own
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirmed this heavy use when i was younger i can feel my memory being shitty and it also caused a mental thing later in my life because of that i literally cant smoke weed for the foreseeable future brain acts up in terrifying ways
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive never heard that developmental effect from weed i would assume it could be a precursor of certain psychological traits or habits if true then do you have any resources to cite from
LifeProTips,not_removed,well said love that advice lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,this has made me socially special for lack of a more negative term i was always a shy kid and never very socially and instead of learning to deal with that and adapt i just smoked cannabis and experimented with other drugs excessively my brain doesnt work the way most peoples do at the same time i am fine with that as most people are the status quo and the reason the world is the way it is right now i really wish i had waited till i was at least before starting to smoke cannabis so much or at the very least have been taught at a young age about moderation from someone i respected interesting thing though i had a handful of close friends in high school who all used drugs the same amount i did although i dont talk to them anymore and havent in years im pretty certain it effected me much more than the others
LifeProTips,not_removed,honestly i really dont know it seems that whenever he was being nice it never really was out of kindness it was more out of if i do this for now hell have to do something for me later he had a short temper and the smallest things could set him off although i hardly remember it my mom told me it got so bad once in the past that i testified in court against him at age
LifeProTips,not_removed,should i be mad if my dad always says stuff like you and your mother when he talks to me about my bad habits they hate each other btw
LifeProTips,not_removed,you should give him gold then
LifeProTips,not_removed,i normally dont comment and i know this wasnt directed to me but thank you your words hit really close to home during a time that i needed them i just wanted you to know that
LifeProTips,not_removed,absolutely my past is the past and while it often still finds a way to bring me pain i never let it effect my family im proud of us thanks so much
LifeProTips,not_removed,his brother is the only one who understands what hes gone through
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah the old reddit
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont know if this helps or not but whenever i hear kids talking about this kind of stuff they always end up loving and respecting the parent who isnt talking shit about their ex
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,they discussed the developmental science around this on the cnn special weed i highly recommend watching that
LifeProTips,not_removed,i am a mental health professional psychologist to be more precise and what you are describing sounds like either skizotypical paranoid psychosis or paranoid personality disorder to me id like to stress that i dont claim to be able to say that he has any of these disorders as a full evaluation would be needed for that only that the symptoms you describe could fit the mold i dont know how useful this information is just remember that while he may be bipolar there is a high degree of comorbidity among psychological disorders and it is not at all uncommon that a person can have a series of different ones at the same time
LifeProTips,not_removed,hmm i guess what worked for me isnt necessarily applicable for you then sorry to hear that i know how uncomfortable it is to have one parent always complaining about the other on an unrelated note ive noticed that my mom has become so hyperaware of the transgressions committed against her that i feel like shes become critical of my soontobewife and is afraid that ill fall into the same trap she fell into i do believe that shes trying to do the right thing but i also cant have her questioning my happiness talking to my friends behind my back about my relationship etc for obvious reasons i guess what im trying to say is thats another boundary that im actively trying to figure out how to set and am wondering if youve dealt with that at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes if your parents either of them put you into their me vs himher or us vs himher scenarios you shouldnt accept that bullshit your parents may be usa vs russia but you are switzerland neutral
LifeProTips,not_removed,both of you should give him gold edit all aboard the gold train thanks stranger

LifeProTips,not_removed,hold my sibling im going in
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think youre right that a lot of times it does end up like thiseventually but a lot of times if the kids are young enough or not strongwilled enough to challenge what they are hearing theyll assume what they hear from their parent is true because why would momdad lie to me with maturation they realize whats going on and come around
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think you should also give him gold
LifeProTips,not_removed,weve all been there
LifeProTips,not_removed,you joke but being the little spoon is by far the best spoon i may be slightly biased maybe the wrong word because im gay but little spoon kicks ass

LifeProTips,not_removed,unless youre married you told her to dress warmer when you left the house its her problem now
LifeProTips,not_removed,look kid i get it that you might be ignorant but come on first saying guys to refer to a group of people including women is pretty rude and i get that it might be a regional thing but just to know for next time is good second and im not trying to nitpick im trying to help having five exclamation points is just overkill and gives the impression that youre immature one will always work better than five third the whole concept of chivalry is dated and fairly sexist it implies that a man is more powerful than women and because of this men should rescue women the whole term comes from knights of the round table being chivalrous and rescuing damsels in distress if we want men and women to be equal then we should treat people equally dont give someone your coat just because they happen to be a woman for all years of my current life um what current art and form of being polite being polite is neither an art nor a form or an art form whichever one you meant to say it doesnt make sense throughout this whole post im getting a very condescending vibe and thats just a bit troubling coming from a no matter if it is whoa slow down she the correct pronoun is she not it i like that you point out that this friend could be male or female but throughout this whole post and the title you keep using gender specific pronouns and its not the most socially acceptable to only use female pronouns and to only call upon men to be nice when someone is in need and youre not going far enough by saying if someone is in need help them thats just called being a decent person and the whole concept of a golden rule is just plain stupid do we really need a golden rule to say be nice isnt that common sense the whole call it karma sentence just doesnt make a whole lot of sense you should watch out for run on sentences your whole last sentence is just out of wack it lacks any kind of appropriate punctuation i dont think anyone is worried about how others will react to them being a decent human being and are you four the grinch who stole christmas thats fiction buddy nobodys thinking that just because youre a scumbag means youre going to steal christmas i think you might need a spell checker its tldr standing for too long didnt read not tdlr im sorry if i offended you but you seem quite condescending and just a bit misogynist you seem quite nieve also i hope that you grow up soon and learn that you dont need to make a post on the internet telling people to be nice
LifeProTips,not_removed,i remember being and thinking i knew stuff
LifeProTips,not_removed,here maybe you should wear these extra gloves my hands are getting kinda sweaty

LifeProTips,not_removed,isnt chivalry more about riding horses and how to behave in combat than anything to do with how to treat women i like to think of being kind to women as more an aspect of decency and moral fiber
LifeProTips,not_removed,the real blah blah blah is always blah blah blah
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think i need to grow up soon and learn that the internet is hopeless and dumb
LifeProTips,not_removed,kinda the point of this
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol dumb and dumber
LifeProTips,not_removed,chivalry was a code that encompasses protection of the weak who couldnt defend themselves in its day a woman was automatically presumed defenseless
LifeProTips,not_removed,as long as youre vigilant and can identify when something is true or not and when to take advice from a youll be fine
LifeProTips,not_removed,just read your post in sixteen years and give us your take on it
LifeProTips,not_removed,what the people wanting to talk about chivalry are ignorant of is it was concerning noble born they had no rules against treating peasants like animals they like to think they are nobility but they are not
LifeProTips,not_removed,hopefully
LifeProTips,not_removed,i would agree theres also this thing called common sense redditers seem to lack it
LifeProTips,not_removed,true enough in a monarchy the people worked for the kingdom and the kingdom doled out what it considered the citizens should have the left way too much room for coruption peasants had no hope of rising above their station which is ironic everyone seems to be upset the democrats arent able to continue doing the same

LifeProTips,not_removed,stand to the side first the amount of people in cities who have no idea that people are behind them when they stop suddenly for some reason is astounding and one of my biggest pet peeves
LifeProTips,not_removed,similarly while enjoying a sunset be sure to turn around and see what the soft light is illuminating
LifeProTips,not_removed,enjoying the area is actually something i have to constantly remind myself of during more challenging hikes pushing on and just looking at your feet really defeats the purpose unless youre just trying to get in shape if i can get into the habit of turning around every once in a while that could help thanks

LifeProTips,not_removed,my road rage is typically induced in situations that are ambiguous where both parties believe they are right if someone cuts me off they know they were wrong whether they admit it or not but if someone exits a travelling lane to skip the queue in a lane that ends then i refuse to let them in front of me they think they are genuinely in the right

LifeProTips,not_removed,advocate for yourself the way you would for a good friend it sounds silly but imagine your standing up for your bestfriend instead of yourself if your unsure of you opinions or why you wantdont want something research it write down your reasons and practice making your argument before talking to the person follow through on your negative thoughts to their conculsion and you will often realise they arent realistic and might even be silly if you stand up for yourself what is the worst the could happen would everyone really hate you would your boss actually fire you your bfgf dump you we build stuff up way too much in our mines

LifeProTips,not_removed,the link doesnt work it says the video doesnt exist
LifeProTips,not_removed,at some companies thats grounds for termination id tread lightly
LifeProTips,not_removed,you sign a contract and are then in breach therein becoming illegal
LifeProTips,not_removed,i only care about what i make
LifeProTips,not_removed,not always i was recently brought into an existing position at the capped salary because the position they really wanted me for wasnt created yet and will have a much higher payscale the subject of pay has come up several times with people who have been there for years and despite the fact that i have a decade or more in the field more than many of them something like this would definitely not been well received even if i hadnt been brought in for another purpose if i had started as a regular team member i would have been brought in at a much higher rate than any of them just based on sheer experience alone coupled with the fact that knowing i was brought in to help fix several situations with the existing team and knowing that their payscales have strong correlations with their actual skills abilities despite tenure experience it would be a very bad thing for this conversation to happen in this location as it would likely result in several lawsuits from people who would claim discrimination when the simple fact is that they just do not do the job well and only just scrape by well enough to avoid getting fired
LifeProTips,not_removed,why are you assuming that youre being underpaid rather than the other guy being overpaid a company has a budget and its usually really tight due to competition unless youre google or fb in order for half the folks to get hike the other half will have to take a cut which is the logical way now if your company cannot afford what you demand then you shouldnt have gone there thats your call not the companys
LifeProTips,not_removed,why are you assuming that youre being underpaid rather than the other guy being overpaid a company has a budget and its usually really tight due to competition unless youre google or fb in order for half the folks to get hike the other half will have to take a cut which is the logical way now if your company cannot afford what you demand then you shouldnt have gone there thats your call not the companys
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont give a turkey as to what anyone else makes i look at my life and based on various factors concerning the job i decide what should get paid
LifeProTips,not_removed,what makes it illegal is that most companies when hired have you read and sign some sort of handbook that explains talking about pay is grounds for termination when you sign you agree to be fired if you fuck up not to mention talking about pay just causes unnecessary bickering between employees ive been in management for a long time and to be honest everyone thinks they deserve more pay work for it and youll get it if you dont then you wont its that simple
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,may i ask what industry you work in or what line of work are you in this happen to me before in retail retail is notorious for doing this crap
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats actually illegal watch the clip and watch the whole episode adam ruins everything season episode
LifeProTips,not_removed,local government bodies will have its own policy over whats ok to fire someone over here in illinois its ok to terminate an employee for any reason or no reason at all
LifeProTips,not_removed,if thats grounds for termination its probably because the company want to severely underpay you and thus yourebetter off somewhere else anyway
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to think like you a long time ago but as government employees my coworkers and my salaries are posted on the internet for the world to see i took a look one day and i realized how underpaid i was based on my credentials and productivity before that moment i thought we were all making the same money i figured that they had nicer cars houses vacations etc than me because i am not as materialistic and dont have a spouse to share costs with silly me i busted my hump after that over the past five years i have increased my compensation above most of my coworkers while they keep waiting fruitlessly for the governor to approve an acrosstheboard raise ive been able to negotiate pay bumps on three separate occasions we are strongly discouraged from talking about anything salary related if this werent the case i could tell my coworkers that they are silly for waiting for an acrosstheboard raise of when they could get much more than that just by presenting a job offer to the boss of course if everyone did that then it wouldnt work so thats another reason why i keep my mouth shut
LifeProTips,not_removed,a company policy is not law how can you believe that is the case
LifeProTips,not_removed,wow thats a load of bs companies hardly ever voluntarily pay people what they are worth and routinely pay people far different amounts for the same job depending how much they made at their last job
LifeProTips,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from and just had this discussion wth my daughter tuesday night but its still dangerous as the company is likely to make up another reason to get rid of you
LifeProTips,not_removed,for those who are curious but dont want to watch the video section of the national labor relations act protects the ability of employees to discuss wages and working conditions with their fellow employees
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh we didnt terminate you for discussing salary nonono we terminated you for being minutes late yesterday and having a minor typo in one of your emails
LifeProTips,not_removed,there are about a hundred other ways to let you go especially if you work in a right to work state
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hame more than enough cash to live on i still dont care what others make a guy doing the same job as me could be making times what i make yes a part of me would be bugged by it but in the grand scheme of things if i am happy and able to live comfortably then i dontcare what others make good for them i also have no bills so i have that going for me
LifeProTips,not_removed,it is for this reason that i try to seem kinda creepy and give off a slight vibe that they really really dont wanna fire me cause im crazy and dont got much to live for
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha yeah in fact let me tweak my lpt if you are going to discuss your salary do it discreetly the one thing that gets me though that i really dont understand is why are people so private about their income its like it is very taboo to ask someone that what gives
LifeProTips,not_removed,right to work has nothing to do with the conversation you have access to search engines use them
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to feel that way because my salary was the bonus in my family then my partner got laid off and i was the main provider then the cost of me not advocating harder for pay equity affected my entire household every dollar i didnt get was a lower base for my future raises it was a lower contribution to my retirement employer match i recently changed jobs and negotiated a bigger pay raise based on being able to tell through public info the pay jump others got making a similar career move i have nothing against the other people i was benchmarking myself against nor was i saying they didnt deserve iti was simply saying i thought i deserved equal compensation
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats fine but remember that circumstances can change and we are also in a damn rat race if your coworker makes times more than you and you both lose your jobs and have to compete against each other guess which one of you automatically stands out as more qualified its like being offered a steak or a steak if someone can afford the more expensive meal they arent going to settle for the cheap one ensuring that your wages stay competitive doesnt make you someone who cares what everyone thinks it just means you dont want your credentials to be cheapened and that you dont take anything for grantedlike that your work will always speak for itself perhaps your work is just as good as your coworkers in all objective measures but if your coworker can manage to convince folks that his work is times as better then all the objective measures in the world dont matter
LifeProTips,not_removed,my state does not use the gs scale
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,just remind them that the stapler is yours and you brought it from home
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol i guess thats one way i just do good work and keep putting away money to live off of in case of emergency and for retirement
LifeProTips,not_removed,way to be the daily douche doug why dont you use said search engines
LifeProTips,not_removed,steak where
LifeProTips,not_removed,in order for it to work you gotta make a good first impression a few months in when your boss knows you are a valuable employee you start to let the cracks show nothing enough to get you fired just subtle ass shit that make people think twice these days its worth mentioning i did this while working on assembly lines ill never know for sure but i think it has helped me out they do everything to use you at these places so fuck em
LifeProTips,not_removed,right to work means that if you join a unionized workplace you cannot be forced to join the union you have the right to work without joining the union it has nothing to do with at will employment
LifeProTips,not_removed,so notedin case i need to use that
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not sure i follow hobbies are just that hobbies you have them because you enjoy them and they add color to your life theyre not supposed to advance your career if everyone put a new hobby through your test most people would have no hobbies theyd just be robots living for work
LifeProTips,not_removed,your post assumes the only longterm benefit to be gained from a hobby is money or other career related things which is not true
LifeProTips,not_removed,your post assumes the only longterm benefit to be gained from a hobby is money or other career related things which is not true sorry perhaps i made the wrong assumption what long term benefits are you describing
LifeProTips,not_removed,those are for you and your future self to decide as longterm benefits are inherently subjective
LifeProTips,not_removed,please explain why hobbies need any benefits at all outside of memories
LifeProTips,not_removed,need is too strong a word the bottom line of this lpt is that you have the power to look past the initial thrust of passion of a low utility hobby and choose ones that subjectively add to your life in greater ways
LifeProTips,not_removed,whois databases simple as that
LifeProTips,not_removed,there are services that can successfully mask your whois information
LifeProTips,not_removed,sure but as far as i know theres nothing better to protect yourself from viruses than searching meta instead of the data itself also if the whois doesnt contain the name of the person it will most likely have the name of the domain name registrar then you dont have to go through every single registrar until you find the one and just go to the registrar who already owns it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i checked after reading this apparently the services i mentioned become the official owners of the domain name i just mean to use these steps to avoid nefarious people in a user friendly way probably should have said that in my original post
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh i see i probably didnt read it correctly my bad also the more informed people become the better too bad this has to be in lpt and not common sense in a perfect world your tip should be there
LifeProTips,not_removed,right
LifeProTips,not_removed,my goodwill takes all the stuff it gets as donations and ships it out and brings in crap from elsewherei live in a rich areawere people donate bags etc
LifeProTips,not_removed,same our goodwills are just like garbage dumps that attracts crime
LifeProTips,not_removed,that makes sense something is more likely to see in a lower income neighborhood than where it was donated
LifeProTips,not_removed,i snag a parda bag and sold it bucks for dollarswhat a win
LifeProTips,not_removed,i work in a low income area and theres no good stuff in goodwill there
LifeProTips,not_removed,i will join a gym editpreferably planet fitnessi will buy expensive running shoes and sexy gym clothes i will actually go twice walking for minutes on a treadmill with zero incline while watching tv exhausted i will grab a strawberry milkshake from sonic on my way home i can do this
LifeProTips,not_removed,one year a long time ago i decided that i could only get starbucks if i got out of the car and walked inside i made it to july without going once and i still always park and walk in which saves time and my car isnt idling
LifeProTips,not_removed,better lpt do not make ny resolutions ever make them on your birthday instead
LifeProTips,not_removed,airbags cant not deflate they have vents as big as tennis balls and fiddling around with a knife right after an accident sounds like a really bad idea you will be shaky disoriented full with adrenaline the real lpt here buy a seatbelt cutterwindow hammer instead
LifeProTips,not_removed,australian lawyer here dont carry a knife in your car if you do make sure it isnt accessible from the drivers seat and is in a toolbox or at least near other tools police hate that shit and you will find yourself before a magistrate very quickly
LifeProTips,not_removed,your airbags are going to be deflated before you even realize they opened up
LifeProTips,not_removed,the air leaving an airbag is how it cushions your face the balloon style airbag is a hollywood film gimmick
LifeProTips,not_removed,better actual advice is to have a glass hammer with a built in seatbelt blade buy one that attaches to the center console and it wont go flying around if you crash the blade is also placed in such a way that you cant cut yourself on it but a seatbelt can be an airbag cannot stay inflated by design legality aside do not keep a knife or scissors in the car as itll start flying around
LifeProTips,not_removed,dpt dont wear seatbelts and predeflate your airbags wait wrong sub
LifeProTips,not_removed,terrible advice fuck me
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats going to be useless if you are actually in a accident because items usually go flying everywhere even more so in a rollover your best option is to carry a pocket knife they make pocket knives specifically for this occasion that are equipped with a window breaker and a seatbelt cutter like this
LifeProTips,not_removed,i got pulled over by the cops in the uki had all my work tools in the boot trunk including several types of work knivesand because they were out of reach of the driver seat that was legalin the front i had a softwood spoon i had carved with a handle that tapered to a pointthe cop proceeded to arrest me for having what could be perceived as a stabbing weapon within reach of the driverwhich is apparently very illegal i remonstrated with cop awhile and tried to reason with himhe called hq for about mins he then came back over and formally dearrested me moral is thoughcareful what you have within reach of your driver seat dont know about us law
LifeProTips,not_removed,an airbag that isnt deflating has already killed or seriously injured the person in the accident they are designed to deflate on impact because if they dont then you might as well have just not had an airbag during the accident for all the difference
LifeProTips,not_removed,should i also keep them in my cup holders at all times oh wise one
LifeProTips,not_removed,was there ever a case of an airbag not deflating
LifeProTips,not_removed,great for bumfights
LifeProTips,not_removed,not sure about this one when my airbags went off they were fully deflated before i even realized what had happened
LifeProTips,not_removed,it also helps convince attractive women to go for drives with you
LifeProTips,not_removed,isnt it illegal to have a knife in your car without a permit or something

LifeProTips,not_removed,removed debunked in comments
LifeProTips,not_removed,this lpt could have helped out lloyd christmas so much when his air bag kept him from catching mary swanson at the airport
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds like a quick way to end up dead in the news and people on reddit saying i was a thug who didnt listen to the officers instructions
LifeProTips,not_removed,i heard you can use the head rest of your car seat as a tool to open the window like the two metal rods that go inside the seats from the headrest
LifeProTips,not_removed,or youre a student under and you park your car on school grounds on the free cops searching cars day
LifeProTips,not_removed,or you cost just live in america where knives are used daily for all sorts of activities and as am added bonus no jail time
LifeProTips,not_removed,can confirm ive been to countless collisions as a paramedic the airbag material is porous and deflates quickly after impact glass hammerseatbelt blade is much safer and useful curtain airbags can be lifted out of the way
LifeProTips,not_removed,is there an ramateurlifetips
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck you indeed you ever hear of a glove compartment a hear a lot of vehicles have that
LifeProTips,not_removed,plus youll have a handy tool that you will probably find comes in handy more often than youd expect
LifeProTips,not_removed,that is going to be useless when your hands are broken op wasnt saying to have a butcher knife on your dashboard your suggestion is just as stupid as theres if thats the way you think
LifeProTips,not_removed,i see youve played knifeyspoony before
LifeProTips,not_removed,i taped my razor blades to the steering wheel
LifeProTips,not_removed,side curtain airbags rollover protection stay inflated
LifeProTips,not_removed,because you carry a pocket knife
LifeProTips,not_removed,if your head rest detaches you can just pick up something like and keep it on your keyring or a place it wont fly around and get lost in an accident
LifeProTips,not_removed,you guys get this way too rarely thank you for what you do you guys have saved my life three times in the past two years and thanks to swift and proper action my currently broken back wont lead to more than six months of back brace and pt instead of much much worse thank you

LifeProTips,not_removed,httpiimgurcomufdayvjjpg found in rwtf
LifeProTips,not_removed,aw thanks
LifeProTips,not_removed,and while your airbag is apparently fully inflated and pinning you to your seat
LifeProTips,not_removed,well thats actually a good point good point person
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh eat my ass sheffield
LifeProTips,not_removed,airbags deflate immediately like there is no way to keep them inflatedthey have big holes in them
LifeProTips,not_removed,right i was just helping pile onto the ops flawed logic
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dont cancel on requested uberssorry im missing how canceling helps you if youre in a hurry think this one went over my head
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a pretty poor tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,does newer mean slower
LifeProTips,not_removed,try a different app or wait a minute to get a new driver yeah that has speed writen all over it
LifeProTips,not_removed,right i mean the lpt was if youre in a hurry
LifeProTips,not_removed,do the exact opposite at target for the exact same reason
LifeProTips,not_removed,climb into the enclosures too the closer the better
LifeProTips,not_removed,take a bucket of raw steak with you and spray yourself with urine
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a volenteer in a zoo in england i can confirm this to the point that when we feed our otters we put on a neon orange cap to try and get them to stop begging for food when anyone in green walks past
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you ever need to hide wear an orange apron at home depot theyll never find you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i hadnt thought of this and it makes sense i accompany special needs groups on outings and occasionally there is a zoo trip they are often disappointed when they cant view an animal they were really looking forward to seeing i will attempt to incorporate this into the pretrip instructions thank you nice tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i may offer an additional zoo protip if you ever see someone with a service dog at the zoo follow them around without being a creeper of course the animals go fucking bananas when they see dogs its amazingly entertaining to see the animals come up to the glass to see whats going on
LifeProTips,not_removed,but then youll get lots of good stories for ridontworkherelady
LifeProTips,not_removed,it works even better at a safari
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wonder if this would work at a strip club
LifeProTips,not_removed,do all animals see color
LifeProTips,not_removed,wear greenthey will think you a bush
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is complete bullshit
LifeProTips,not_removed,good advice and along that line of thinking when you go to the zoo do not dress up in a gorilla outfit i did this to surprise my then girlfriend and was going to ask her to marry me lets just say ending up in the er after being tranquilized is not romantic nobody ever talks about this but tranqs the zoo uses are muscle relaxers really strong ones and that includes your sphincter so i shit all over myself before passing out so say goodbye to that deposit for one gorilla costume i often wonder whatever happened to her we stopped seeing each other abruptly
LifeProTips,not_removed,even better dress up like an animal
LifeProTips,not_removed,the workers at my zoo wear street clothesno uniform at least the ones that feed and take care of the animals
LifeProTips,not_removed,arnt most animals colour blind
LifeProTips,not_removed,except you look like that one asshole staff member who teases the monkeys and they see you coming and throw feces at you
LifeProTips,not_removed,shouldnt this be noted as dangerous maybe its not a good idea to have a silverback gorilla coming up to you when youre not trained to work with them
LifeProTips,not_removed,will they still masturbate furiously and throw their feces at me im referring to the employees btw
LifeProTips,not_removed,or just dont support animal abuse and go anywhere else
LifeProTips,not_removed,and youll have plenty of stories for ridontworkherelady
LifeProTips,not_removed,finally i have a use for my khaki pants and shirts
LifeProTips,not_removed,how do you find out the color of the uniform at a zoo
LifeProTips,not_removed,so khaki and khaki
LifeProTips,not_removed,now just tell that to all the other zoogoers and then we can finally view those baboons
LifeProTips,not_removed,youll also become a tourist attraction
LifeProTips,not_removed,its true a few years ago my daughter really wanted me to dress up like we were going on a safari when we went to the zoo i wore a tan shirt and khakis and pretty much looked like steve irwin and every employee at the zoo can confirm the animals were like oh hey what up tho you got the food
LifeProTips,not_removed,once my dad unintentionally did this we didnt know the gorilla had aggression issues towards men we got quite a show of the gorilla beating his chest and yelling a zoo employee asked my dad to walk away so they could calm him down
LifeProTips,not_removed,i thought dogs were color blind
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wear my own little uniform which sort of resembles that of a zoo keeperpark rangerboy scout mastertree trimmer it is a look i have perfected over the years anyway yeah people assume i work at the zoo and ask me zoo questions
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did this inadvertently once there was a white tiger that came right up to me and put its paws right on the glass in front of me he followed me back and forth for some time after that
LifeProTips,not_removed,im fairly certain the animals recognize keepers based on smell
LifeProTips,not_removed,ridontworkherelady
LifeProTips,not_removed,very interesting
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,this isnt an actual lpt op this is equivalent to going up to a dog with a fake beard on because their owner has a beard animals dont get to see most of the staff and they see way fewer keepers not even mentioning the animals that dont directly interact with anybody eg big cats they would have no reason to come up to you just because youre wearing the same colors as the staff doesnt mean that the animal is gonna be so stupid its gonna think youre their keeper source worked at woodland park zoo here in seattle for a couple of years with the animals directly
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont go to zoos
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats how my uncle got killed by blackfish at seaworld
LifeProTips,not_removed,lets just not go to zoos instead
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol i once accidentally did that in target and ended up helping some dude get set up with an entire new kitchen he was separating from his wife and starting from scratch
LifeProTips,not_removed,had a customer come up to me and state excuse me i need help finding something in that angry self righteous tone i cant stand when customers treat me this way so i took a lot of pleasure in making her feel like an ass when i told her i mam dont even fucking work at american eagle
LifeProTips,not_removed,always in the comments that real life tip
LifeProTips,not_removed,you can do the exact same thing at walmart in any color polo and slacks because no one pays attention ive been asked for help too many times there
LifeProTips,not_removed,damn i cant believe i came here to say this and someone else had the same experience
LifeProTips,not_removed,when you see this interaction first on wholesome memes

LifeProTips,not_removed,thats not already something we regularly do
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,is green just the standard uniform colour for zoo employees my local one uses full green outfits too
LifeProTips,not_removed,or youll be the only one they find
LifeProTips,not_removed,wore a blue buttondown to lowes was definitely found
LifeProTips,not_removed,go in the morning animals sleep in the afternoon
LifeProTips,not_removed,also go on a cold day the animals will move around more in an attempt to warm up so youll get a better view of them
LifeProTips,not_removed,sounds vaguely depressing to see them run up in curiosity over an animal whos not behind glass though
LifeProTips,not_removed,but then youll get lots of good stories for ridontworkhereladylion ftfy
LifeProTips,not_removed,if i went there wearing the same thing as the workers then yes everyone would want to get closer to me
LifeProTips,not_removed,not all but many of the cool ones that youd be interested in seeing in the zoo httpsaskabiologistasueducolorsanimalssee
LifeProTips,not_removed,i want to believe
LifeProTips,not_removed,its kind of misleading to call a dichromat animal color blind its only a deficiency relative to the average humans vision most mammals are dichromats seeing blue and yellow as primary colors some monkeys and apes humans included are trichromats seeing red blue and green as primary colors that said there are tetrachromats monochromats etc sea lions may be completely color blind
LifeProTips,not_removed,what
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol by paying admission to go to the zoo amazing lpt isnt it also op forgets that staffkeepers
LifeProTips,not_removed,clearly you havent seen the reaction of a dog when someone switches tofrom having a beard
LifeProTips,not_removed,what
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt if you are feeling lonely and want to connect with someone go to target and wear a red polo shirt
LifeProTips,not_removed,good guy here
LifeProTips,not_removed,i had this happen at canadian tire a lady approached me looking for advice on pool chemicals which i was also shopping for i helped her get a cart full of chemicals to address her pool issues with instruction on how to use them she then discovered that i was a lowly civilian dressed in the right colours and proceeded to become irate at me that i didnt tell her i didnt work there she then abandoned her cart to find someone who knew what they were talking about good luck with the high school student who probably doesnt have a pool
LifeProTips,not_removed,what a wholesome comment
LifeProTips,not_removed,fuck you i quit and storm off
LifeProTips,not_removed,ridontworkherelady
LifeProTips,not_removed,im not falling into that ill let someone else take a shot
LifeProTips,not_removed,and gorillas i hear they are friendly in cincinati zoo i probably misspelled both gorilla and cincinati
LifeProTips,not_removed,sneks
LifeProTips,not_removed,we will never you horambe
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats something to expect in geriatric gynecology practice
LifeProTips,not_removed,a forest green or beigetan earthy colors will minimize the appearance of dirt also probably some negative issues with brighter colors for some animals
LifeProTips,not_removed,now that you mention it that seems to be the case but i actually have no idea i think its most likely to avoid bright colours around any animals which would find them intimidating as green is more than likely the most common colour to the majority of the animals in the wild and it not a sign of danger in the wild either like reds and yellows
LifeProTips,not_removed,if so send them to the wrong department need pvc its in welding need a lag bolt try seasonal supplies
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,that one i knew but thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,i feel like blue balling them on food is a bad idea
LifeProTips,not_removed,im in a job where i work with animals they do react to people in the same colour clothing we have absolutely no issue with this and its really nice for visitors to get some interaction with them as for the food bad idea in our case particularly teasing them with food increases the chances of biting
LifeProTips,not_removed,from their point of view the dog is behind glass
LifeProTips,not_removed,that too good point
LifeProTips,not_removed,me to bro me to
LifeProTips,not_removed,the real lpt is always sleeping in the morning comments

LifeProTips,not_removed,i did this for a customer one time i overheard the bb employee trying to offer solutions for some thing computer related i butted in and asked the lady what she was looking for she gave me a brief idea of what she was looking for i started explaining a few things and she looked at the bb employee the bb employee looked right at her and said this guy knows more than me and walked away
LifeProTips,not_removed,ya haha canadian tire started as a tire and auto parts store but they have grown into a autozonehome depotwalmartcabelas so they have everything
LifeProTips,not_removed,this ends here my brain can take no more
LifeProTips,not_removed,dont buy the cables
LifeProTips,not_removed,i almost got kicked out when i told an old man that a laptop was overkill for using facebook and skyping with his family
LifeProTips,not_removed,damn thats great fuck them for calling the cops
LifeProTips,not_removed,whats up with chumlee at the end
LifeProTips,not_removed,ah makes sense now thanks for clearing that up for all us noncanadians
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok
LifeProTips,not_removed,most the time it is cables with added gold ends and braided cable
LifeProTips,not_removed,thanks he says with a look of sincerity and relief after hearing the truth for the first time in a retail environment it was as refreshing to him as it was surprising who was this young person willing to offer help to a stranger and who was he to receive such a gift of kindness suddenly a menacing scowl formed on the mans brow as quick as the look of relief that came before it he turns toward the nearest best buy employee and with great exaggeration he raised his middle finger the employee knew right away as to the meaning of the contempt after all this happens on a weekly basis the interaction was accepted by all parties involved as quickly as it had all started it was over the old man was now satisfied in his view every positive interaction required an equal and opposite reaction the balance of his personal universe was complete
LifeProTips,not_removed,is a pretty legit laptop though can probably play all games on max graphic settings
LifeProTips,not_removed,unit respond to best buy for a report of people wearing blue polo shirts inside the store uhhh what
LifeProTips,not_removed,tbh it isnt that funny and its funny at the expense of everyone working in that store it sucks to make life harder for people who work in customer service just for a laugh honestly i probably would call the cops too if a hundred people showed up to my business in my employees uniforms to loiter around my store and refused to leave not even to mention the very legitimate concern of mass shoplifting
LifeProTips,not_removed,hopefully they got a huge fine for the frivolous call
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you ever write a book id like to read it lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,or was a basic mac
LifeProTips,not_removed,their abercrombie prank was better
LifeProTips,not_removed,which would be perfect for skyping and facebook
LifeProTips,not_removed,this would be great for people who arent like me and use five different emails for everything
LifeProTips,not_removed,just start using swift key or other modern keyboards that dows the same thing
LifeProTips,not_removed,meh just use a password manager like avast passwords just one password and it autofills login credentials completely secure too
LifeProTips,not_removed,or a sandwich nothing like finding a nice reuben on my windshield after shopping at target
LifeProTips,not_removed,just use your keys to scratch your details into their car im sure theyll be happy
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you ever get in a accident call the local police station they will take you information and give it to the other person the local authorities will then call or mail you with the other parties information plus its always good to get a second set of eyes on the accident so they cant say it was a hit and run
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just write a note on my ipad and leave it on their windshield
LifeProTips,not_removed,good idea also props to you trying so hard to leave your info many people would have peeled off and not said anything
LifeProTips,not_removed,might as well put some paper and a pencil inside the bag while youre at it
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a box of contractor cleanup bags just you know accidents
LifeProTips,not_removed,or if you need to sell some drugs unexpectedly
LifeProTips,not_removed,happened to me once i broke the windshield and left the note in the glove box no need for bags
LifeProTips,not_removed,gel ink doesnt run after it dries and will write on wet paper
LifeProTips,not_removed,or or dont hit other cars

LifeProTips,not_removed,doesnt do any good if the paper disintegrates
LifeProTips,not_removed,haha i do this with a bottle of the naked blue machine smoothies you see at the fridges at starbucks they wont always be happy about blending it with ice for you but when they do it its an amazing smoothie
LifeProTips,not_removed,so you want water with a dash of cold drink ill just ask for light ice or order something with free refills
LifeProTips,not_removed,sure but this way you can use this extra ounces of ice
LifeProTips,not_removed,and youre an asshole
LifeProTips,not_removed,pull out your highlight reel a lot of the examples that you read have a lot of specially positioned reallylongword visionary elite bullshit in them or theyre examples because theyre the best of the best not because they represent you know normal people yet normal people get into grad school so it is possible right normal people have ups and downs they have times in their lives where they did something excellent and times in their lives where they fucked up so sit down and inventory your ididexcellent memories then sort them into the kinds of truthful memories and the reasons behind those memories that are relevant that would be good components of a statement of purpose spend some serious metime going through this sort of thing next write a page of something simple make it the right length and with the right content then and only then rip out your thesaurus to see if the simple words have betterfitting alternates finally have someone thats a friend and that has good writing skills review it dont rely on spellcheckers and grammar software get a human who plays with business documents to look it over if you know anyone and best of luck
LifeProTips,not_removed,as a phd in physics i often get asked what weight i place on having a doctorate it is certainly not raw intelligence in that i know plenty of phds who are flat out idiots nor is it specific knowledge in that i know autodidacts with better specific knowledge my opinion is that the two primary things that phds have going for them is that they have a prescribed range of knowledge with fewer indiscipline blind spots and they jumped through all the flaming hoops to get through their doctorate as such persistence is a much better indicator of success in grad school than raw intelligence or flash if you can communicate that it will help considerably
LifeProTips,not_removed,talk about areas where youve improved or learned especially if you went out of your way to get help with a certain skill or task youre going to school to learn so prove that youre willing and able to do so
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you need someone to write a personal statement for you there are loads of websites online you can ask
LifeProTips,not_removed,write with your heart that internal voice you have write the story you want and make sure it conveys the one thing the school is looking for maybe it is what the commentors said dilligence perseverence etc but make it your own voice your own emotions then please them with the theme
LifeProTips,not_removed,thank you very much for your advice my main issue here is an explanation for my average grades i cant think of one other than the fact that well im average
LifeProTips,not_removed,is there anywhere else in the application to describe circumstances that may have affected your grades
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did it and also my wifes name just in case now if i only could remember where i left the ring havent seen it since
LifeProTips,not_removed,also engrave the spouses name
LifeProTips,not_removed,why not just enter it in your calendar i have me wedding date engraved in my wedding band but i very rarely look at it and id probably forget about it quickly however i look at my calendar fairly often
LifeProTips,not_removed,or you can put something thin like panty hose over a vacuum hose and suck it out of the slot ive used this method quite a few times and it usually helps
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont go out to eat if you cant afford your own meal
LifeProTips,not_removed,didnt know waiters are good constraint problem solvers
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt how do get your food spat in
LifeProTips,not_removed,a large table ordering food can take an absolute age whilst everyone chats amongst themselves and when the food does arrive people inevitably forget what theyve ordered so you end up with lots of confusion this only happens to groups that cannot make up their minds or have no idea what theyre doing in which case this tip may just be the solution such a group can use
LifeProTips,not_removed,i really like this but i would only try this if the waiter seemed engaging and up for something like this and made it clear to them when proposing the idea that wed be happy with any and all of their decisions while handing them a and letting them know there will still be a generous tip this really could be a fun thing to try
LifeProTips,not_removed,when i waited tables this is the absolute best thing people do when ordering why on earth would anybody spit in food when a table orders in this way it means i dont need to spend ages discussing what ingredients are in what taking orders having people change their mind it also makes it impossible get their order wrong impossible to deliver food to the wrong person and gives me some pride that they respect my ability to choose items off the menu that will work well together
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep in my experience the bigger the group the more likely this is to happen it only takes one person to get lost in the conversation to forget to look at the menu and hold everyone else up
LifeProTips,not_removed,where is the line between a protip and common sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,the taxi just doesnt show up
LifeProTips,not_removed,good luck getting a taxi at these times the real tip is to plan ahead of time so you wont be reliant on these services at high demand times
LifeProTips,not_removed,lol nice try taxi company
LifeProTips,not_removed,nope honestly im at the point where i refuse to take taxis unless they have an app because i want their old antiquated business model to die
LifeProTips,not_removed,i honestly wouldnt even know how to get a taxido you call is there an app i dont know these things uber and lyft are appealing because all i have to do is tell my phone to get me car
LifeProTips,not_removed,taxis about to disrupt the gig economy
LifeProTips,not_removed,check select black and suv also cheaper than a taxi and surge less than uberxlyft
LifeProTips,not_removed,im old as fuck and have yet to find the need to use ubertaxi outside of the top us cities its like you all just get drunk on a whim are designated drivers not a thing anymore
LifeProTips,not_removed,hello udrwhogivesafuck thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons your post has been removed because it is considered common sensecommon courtesy if you would like to appeal this decision httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetorlifeprotips alternatively you can resubmit using httpwwwredditcomrlifeprotipssubmitresubmittrue make sure you rlifeprotipsaboutsidebar before submitting thank you
LifeProTips,not_removed,taxis where youre from dont surcharge for events
LifeProTips,not_removed,have fun waiting hours for your cab
LifeProTips,not_removed,its all in the upvotes and downvotes
LifeProTips,not_removed,when its depressingly obvious what to do yet people dont do it its common sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive seen crazy high surcarges i think theyve balanced it out to be a bit more reasonable recently but they can be quite high during these holidaysconcertscelebrationssporting events but what really makes it expensive is the traffic i had a ride once that was only two miles but it took us an hour to get there it was like people and luckily i wasnt the one that called it because it ended up cost sum bucks so i try to avoid use a car as a means of transit when its super busy but at those times uberlyft can just be ridiculous
LifeProTips,not_removed,i live near wrigley field in chicago taxis are usually pretty cheap here but if its busy or if they think youre drunk enough they will way overcharge you and if you leave your phone or something in the car youre never going to get it back dont ever take a taxi unless you absolutely have to
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think it makes more sense in europe i tried to get an uber the other night and it was on a surcharge € minimum fare
LifeProTips,not_removed,last night i got a ride quoted for dollars checked again in minutes and it was thats robbery
LifeProTips,not_removed,by not going anywhere or
LifeProTips,not_removed,so recommending a taxi for like times is somehow shilling how does that make sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,sometimes you dont need an app like when there is a taxi stand with a line of taxis waiting to pick people up
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes there are plenty of taxi apps nowadays
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes you have to call usually places like hotels and restaurants have the number on hand or can call for you
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you are in a big city just go to a hotel there are usually taxis waiting also taxis just driving around with the light onjust wave and it stops
LifeProTips,not_removed,you choose a book for reading
LifeProTips,not_removed,just google your city taxi and call the number its not rocket surgery
LifeProTips,not_removed,designated driver you mean someone who arbitrarily doesnt have fun for an entire night for no reason when incredibly economical alternatives exist such as uber that need is rapidly dying due to technology for obvious reasons now the people who are staying in on a saturday night can monetize their time instead of just waiting around or being the lone sober person at a bar its one step away from having completely driverless cars on demand for every human all the time its a fascinating time to be alive
LifeProTips,not_removed,when the line for the express lane at jewel is people long and the nonexpress lane directly next to it is open
LifeProTips,not_removed,surcharges occur based on how many people have the app open not necessarily ordering a ride thats why they are high on holidays or sporting events
LifeProTips,not_removed,two miles an hour is a slow walk traffic is messed up
LifeProTips,not_removed,it expensive is the traffic i had a ride once that was only two miles but it took us an hour to get there it was like people and luckily i wasnt the one that called it because it ended up cost sum bucks so i try to avoid use a car as a means of transit when its super busy but at those times uberlyft can just be ridiculous if it was only miles away it should take you minutes to walk why pay so much
LifeProTips,not_removed,hey chicago whaddayou say
LifeProTips,not_removed,you mean transparency
LifeProTips,not_removed,public transportation not needing to travel at the exact surge times coordinating other transportation party bus routinely cheaper per person if you live somewhere only accessible by car for sports games go grab a beer or dinner after the game minutes later theres basically no surge
LifeProTips,not_removed,i ran into this after a cruise there was a line of taxis with posted rates to the local airports i dont know if uber would have been cheaper but theres no way it could be faster
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive never had to get a taxi in my whole life its not sadive just never needed one thats why i use uber instead
LifeProTips,not_removed,no its not but uber is just so much easier in my opinion thats all i was getting at
LifeProTips,not_removed,heels and drunk girls being stubborn and not willing to walk
LifeProTips,not_removed,that was a very thorough and reasonable response im a hermit so i can do nothing with this information but i appreciate it
LifeProTips,not_removed,lets all be real walking off the booze is a total buzzkill anyways totally understand
LifeProTips,not_removed,and if youre a competent pet owner try training to come to you when you call them the command can even be called something simpler like join me now my companion
LifeProTips,not_removed,nice try pavlov you cant trick me
LifeProTips,not_removed,my cats were trained to the can opener they would hide somewhere in the house but i could push the button on the can opener and instantly cat is at my feet rubbing my leg and meowing
LifeProTips,not_removed,before you know it you will feel like a disney princess
LifeProTips,not_removed,i actually do this with my cat when its time for his tea i sing the abc song and when i get to t i make it a question if i even say a in the same note his little head swivels around to look at me immediately
LifeProTips,not_removed,a simple whistle would do no need to sing
LifeProTips,not_removed,we use a particular whistle to call our cats a whistle carries really well and brings them in from wherever theyre lurking usually
LifeProTips,not_removed,i just shout my cats names
LifeProTips,not_removed,yea so when you come home from work an realise that they go outside just crank the base up and play the song
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats works great too its just not as loud p
LifeProTips,not_removed,my friend just yells cat as loud as he can and it works lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,how drunk were you when you posted this
LifeProTips,not_removed,in soviet russia clothes rack you
LifeProTips,not_removed,itt when english is not your first second or third language
LifeProTips,not_removed,so youre posting an lpt on reddit thats advising small children to scream so they can be found when hiding in clothes racks kids that young most likely arent on reddit if they want to be found why scream why not just exit the clothes rack
LifeProTips,not_removed,when if posting on reddit learning of language not impotent
LifeProTips,not_removed,what the fuck is this
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the funniest thing ive read all day
LifeProTips,not_removed,so this is a lpt to parents who are in a mall and their children are hiding in clothes racks op is telling the parent to run away and the kid will scream so that you will find them somehow youre supposed to know that your missing child is actually hiding in the clothes rack without knowing where they are either way this post should be upvoted i greatly enjoyed it
LifeProTips,not_removed,leave kids and hope someone else buys them
LifeProTips,not_removed,i wish i knew this ten years ago thanks anyway op it is sound advice
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is an awesome thread
LifeProTips,not_removed,on an offnote its amusing to see a nonnew account with negative karma lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,how do we go from this comment to if in mall hiding kids in clothes racks run away they scream to finding them
LifeProTips,not_removed,how do we go from this comment to if in mall hiding kids in clothes racks run away they scream to finding them
LifeProTips,not_removed,tldr very drunk
LifeProTips,not_removed,shitty grammar and misspellings are infuriating enough but your lack of punctuation is what drives me crazy if you want people to listen to your thoughts you need to put more effort into formatting it properly at least make it look like you tried ffs
LifeProTips,not_removed,idont speak london thats an understatement
LifeProTips,not_removed,for what now
LifeProTips,not_removed,your username is perfect english yet you cant type
LifeProTips,not_removed,crule to the buyer
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree that it is poorly written but nobody forced you to read it let alone comment on it bitching about a poor quality post adds even less than the post that inspired the bitching i realize the irony in my statement
LifeProTips,not_removed,better keep trying youll get it
LifeProTips,not_removed,offendive idfk
LifeProTips,not_removed,straws help me when im using a straw i drink like three times more water straws make it fun
LifeProTips,not_removed,water bottles everywhere fill some bottles and fill your fridge with them have some by your bed keep some in your car carry a few in your bagpack just make it easily accessible at all times and dont buy soda
LifeProTips,not_removed,try flavoring your water with lemon cucumber limes orange slices etc put them right in your water bottle keeps you from getting bored
LifeProTips,not_removed,fill a glass drink it repeat
LifeProTips,not_removed,that being said i fill up a glass at work and refill it whenever i get up to go to the bathroom or get thirsty if you want to avoid drinking sugary drinks consider treating them as a dessert maybe per day
LifeProTips,not_removed,use a water drink reminder app there are a bunch of different ones on ios and android
LifeProTips,not_removed,multiple answers saying either straws or water bottles my answer is water bottle with straw the best one for me is the starbucks cup with straws that you can buy more of in different colors which holds over i just keep an icy glass of water beside me while doing work at my desk or just around if im at home or not at a desk in the summer i add some mint from the garden or make concentrated tea or juice ice cubes to add some flavour alsoor add a little squirt of lemon or lime i go through one to two in an hour work day
LifeProTips,not_removed,get a canteen with a hook wear your water around and drink as much as u like any time any where
LifeProTips,not_removed,i read somewhere that men can decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke by half drinking a full glass of water before bed and as soon we wake up that was motivation enough for me having a high stress career
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you mean how to drink water as oppose to say sugary drinks then my advice to you is forming a solid understanding that water is directly involved in the respiratory process aka generating energy if the problem is drinking more fluids in general whether its water or just waterbased like some people said it depends highly on activity levels also drinking water can not only cool you down but help maintain warmth the best ways of forming good drinking habits is having a water source easily accessible even if you are not thirsty
LifeProTips,not_removed,ok i recently bought my self a stainless steel tumbler like a yeti rambler that keeps ice for around hours what that means is i have cold water waiting for me always and ive been noticing that i drink tons more water
LifeProTips,not_removed,look up some apps to download that could help you out one has a little plant that grows and grows when you document the water you drink ive realized that the more you make yourself drink water the thirstier you getresulting in you drinking more water its a vicious cycle in a good way
LifeProTips,not_removed,serious question everytime i try to commit to drinking more water i have to goto the bathroom a day whats a good way to pace yourself yet still drink enough water
LifeProTips,not_removed,anytime you make yourself a meal no matter what you pour as your beverage pour yourself a glass of water as well itll also help fill tou up more and leave you less hungry in addition for each time you urinate look into having a little bit of water to top yourself off itll go through your system licketysplit
LifeProTips,not_removed,get yourself a decent reusable water bottle i went with a camelbak eddy with the bite valve its only like the straw and valve are cheap and easily replaceable when they wear down i replace mine maybe once a year the bite valve is entertaining when youre spaced out get in the habit of keeping it full and taking it everywhere with you work car gym next to your bed etc drinking eight glasses of water a day is excessive and unnecessary but you should drink it whenever youre thirsty and youll be amazed how easy it is once youre in the habit of having your bottle with you at all times not to mention youre not causing lots of plastic waste from disposable water bottles and youll drink less unhealthy things because you wont feel the craving as often and youre likely to snack less
LifeProTips,not_removed,removed not a lpt drinking a ton of water is not actually healthier and nearly all of the comments here are common sense
LifeProTips,not_removed,especially crazy straws didnt know they even still made these httpwwwkrazystrawscom
LifeProTips,not_removed,this has helped me tremendously for me i just fill up my sports bottle with ice and water in the morning and carry it with me throughout the day it has a hook on the handle which makes it convenient if i have to leave it in the car for whatever reason its still ice cold when i get back i drastically increased my water intake this way and it saved me a bundle i used to get energy drinks et al while out this put a stop to that
LifeProTips,not_removed,agreed i have a big hydroflask that i take to work every day i fill it times a day usually but if i forget it i drink like one cup of water the whole day for me having a big ass container sitting there that i dont have to refill is so key probably just laziness but oh well
LifeProTips,not_removed,has anyone ever successfully flavored something with cucumber im picturing one of those instagram detox waters with a bunch of cucumber slices in it
LifeProTips,not_removed,username checks out here
LifeProTips,not_removed,heres an example
LifeProTips,not_removed,they also have make your own krazy straw you connect the pieces edit autocorrect is racist
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes at work we have a large water cooler that gets filled with cucumber and lemon slices we call it skittles water
LifeProTips,not_removed,the fuck is a rain shower
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,yep apparently popular in europe i like them because you feel enveloped in a curtain of water rather than a spray that only hits a portion of your body while the rest is hotcold
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think its a satisfaction thing when you say you will do something and someone says thats so cool of you but youve yet to do it then you will get off on the complement and not follow through or something
LifeProTips,not_removed,my problem is when i tell people how ive started to achieve my goal they praise me this makes me feel like ive accomplished something and that i dont need to follow through with it nowadays i just keep it to myself and let people know when ive actually completed my goal
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is the topic of a httpswwwtedcomtalksdereksiverskeepyourgoalstoyourselflanguageen
LifeProTips,not_removed,for the love of god you are not pro at whatever you were aiming to accomplish
LifeProTips,not_removed,this isnt a tip its op venting about these people
LifeProTips,not_removed,agree theres also a shame cycle that you build in for yourself set goal tell people fail feel shame because people know fall back into bad habits
LifeProTips,not_removed,kind of the same about losing weight if you tell people you are trying they will feel obligated to say you look trimmer when someone actually complements you without you telling them you know you did a good job and it was a genuine complement
LifeProTips,not_removed,psychologically speaking saying what your goals are out loud to another person is like verbally making a promise to the other person therefore helping you achieve said goals i feel like it helped me to quit cigarettes even if it only helped a little
LifeProTips,not_removed,ive seen two diametrically opposed sets of results on this some people are consistently more motivated by a secret goal some people feel obligated to hold to a public goal it becomes a contract for people who need the support of others expectations brain storming on the topic referrals etc it can be very helpful to talk about it secretive types can manage this to some extent by approaching their families with the right experience and encouraging them to tell stories about it theyll enjoy it and no obligation was created people who arent sure whether theyll require the social obligation can try this quiz
LifeProTips,not_removed,actually thats exactly why it doesnt work good on you to realize it yourself
LifeProTips,not_removed,
LifeProTips,not_removed,it would work if accountability is a motivator
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is it thats where i realized the power of keeping it to yourself i knew it all along but this it where i recognized it in me p
LifeProTips,not_removed,what uespereo linked here is only exception to ops lpt and i second op i m that kind of guy who performs well in secrecy also i have felt this in team exception of this lpt kudos
LifeProTips,not_removed,be motivated to stay accountable then
LifeProTips,not_removed,to me i think its better to get your goals kinda in the dark horse sort of way to not let people know what you are doing because i think it offers a couple of advantages if you dont follow through no body knows nobody is left disapointed but you and yourself felt judged only by me exept i know what my circumstance is say i couldnt cuz of time reasons or what have you you understand yourself and you will know your intentions and if you are actually very self critical you will know on what you fucked up and what your sticking points are on in a way you are keeping yourself accountable to your own deal so in real terms you are minding your own business the other reason i think i like to go dark horse route is that like op says people simply dont give a fuck you make a comment about say i want to lose weight cuz i am too fat the person might be like cool go for it but in reality they dont truly give a fuck simply because they cant do anything to help you they wont care they dont want to invest on you only you can invest in yourself sounds a bit selfish but that is life everyone want their shit together and more before helping anybody else also i think people could downplay your goals as it always happens with people say you take a hobbie about learning rphotography so you take a free class from said sub then you tell it to a friend theyd be like oh big deal you like taking pictures so can anyone else its really easy to be discouraged like that when people just put it simply instead of the actual work you put in things like i weightlift to get fitter and stronger then someone is like oh you pick up things and put them down how amusing like what the fuck get the point lastly i feel like telling someone about your goals really puts you up to a comparison which always makes you feel like shit since there is chance that what you are doing there is someone more advanced andor better than you say you say oh i want to go to the gym and start getting ripped someone might answer soemthing like well look mike he is done that shit he is already ripped and he got nothing of it or look mike is jacked he took how long will it take you at the end of the day the video is correct dont tell anybody about your goals that way if you screw up you are only one to know if you succeed or not it doesnt matter if its a simple goal such as saving up money to go on a trip or what have you people will judge you for it and youd be left feeling like shit really what matter is what you hold important if you feel saving money is important to you for that grand canyon trip then go for it we know billgates has billion but guess what you arent bill gates so dont compare yourself tldr compare yourself only with your previous self and that is that hold your own opinion about yourself and your goals to you since really everybody can just comment on the supperficial and leave you feeling discouraged and dumb instead of actually understanding your intent and what it means to you so you hold that opinion over anybodies but dont be diluted so please approach goals in a discrete way
LifeProTips,not_removed,just to add ee customers get six months of apple music for free so well worth using

LifeProTips,not_removed,there is a delusion among suburban folk that urban crime is random this is hysterical bullshit which blinds them to the fact that urban crime specifically targets individuals who fail to treat street people as people and specifically individuals who relate to urban folk as a blight or inconvenience instead there is a twisted moral reciprocity at play source conversations with street folks over the years in san francisco and oakland ca ive had it repeatedly explained to me why ive never been mugged by people whove openly talked about knocking over others why and how they pick who they do just a smile and how you doin is good enough cigarettes are good clementines the little oranges work best though for some weird reason nothing lights up someones gratitude and respect quite like a little selfcontained package of simple sugars and vitamin c apparently whoda thunk
LifeProTips,not_removed,you got it figured out some told me this along time ago and it has helped me just thought i would pass it on
LifeProTips,not_removed,wait they told you afterwards they were going to mug you before you gave them the cigarette i mean if it worked and it saved you how do you kbow they were planing to do sonethijg in the firat place
LifeProTips,not_removed,just hang up on them and block the number i dont even bother talking to them
LifeProTips,not_removed,theyre all automated now anyways
LifeProTips,not_removed,another tip is to use log off of the wifi source log back in and use a new email many public wifi spots use emails to keep track of your use so changing them makes the system think youre a different person note you might get spam on multiple accounts if you do this
LifeProTips,not_removed,it spoof not change since the mac address is physically on the network card you need to fake it
LifeProTips,not_removed,yeah i always thought it was supposed to be extremely difficult and often prone to errors maybe op means ip address
LifeProTips,not_removed,no you can manually change the address your network card that is the reason why mac address ban is not a thing in games it is too easy to get around
LifeProTips,not_removed,for windows you go to control panel system settings system device manager network adapters your network card advanced network address and just write a value for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,no in fact the opposite is true the process pretty much entails downloading a free utility and hitting a button though your true mac address is burned into your network card it can be spoofed using software windows even has a built in mac address randomization feature in the settings that generates a new mac address for each wifi network
LifeProTips,not_removed,you mean on online games that surely is not the reason mac addresses and ip addresses are on totally different layers of the isoosi model a remote server would never even see the mac address of the computer initiating the connection
LifeProTips,not_removed,at the very least think through what your emotional reaction should be if your plan fails so you dont freak out
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats planning for failure moblerp morty
LifeProTips,not_removed,i have a backup plan for everything i do even if im being rewarded for something
LifeProTips,not_removed,i know there is a way to sort them in to categories but is that only afterwards can you do it whilst saving them as well
LifeProTips,not_removed,nah saved posts arent for looking at later lol
LifeProTips,not_removed,yes i see this a lot in class also dont feel afraid to ask questions someone else probably has the same question and is too shy when they see you ask the question they may feel more comfortable in asking questions in the future besides im sure your teachers are more than happy to answer your question
LifeProTips,not_removed,also if no one else wants to answer you should answer with your best logical guess i did this for my last thermodynamics class and every answer i got wrong i literally gave a guess whenever no one else would i ended up knowing better than anything else when it came to the final exam
LifeProTips,not_removed,man this is my current course theres of us answering all the time if we dont bother then nobody else will
LifeProTips,not_removed,i used to do this in college because its kinda sad to see the professor asking questions to air but i feel like im being that guy since nothing really changes despite my enthusiasm since most of these are graded i usually even offer my friends some answers so that other people will do and not just me all the time
LifeProTips,not_removed,its fun until you give a wrong answer
LifeProTips,not_removed,every class i take is the same the professor practically has to pull teeth to get people to answer anything i usually answer one or two questions and then attempt to let others do so but after a while either i give up and answer it or the professor does im not always right or anything but who cares learning isnt about being talked at for an hour and a half you need to think the most knowledgeable people on earth are the ones who started asking questions and never stopped if you want to be less wrong you need to find out what you are wrong about in the first place
LifeProTips,not_removed,i tried this before but one time i just sat there like a doofus with my hand in the air for a whole minute before realizing the teacher already called on me a few times and he was waiting for someone else to answer eventually half the class had their hands raised and then the teacher called on someone
LifeProTips,not_removed,i did this and once actually answered it wrong but we had a substitute and she didnt notice felt bad afterwards
LifeProTips,not_removed,even if the other students dont care your professor will be relieved someone spoke and its a pretty easy way to stack up those brownie points
LifeProTips,not_removed,depends on the type of teacher ive had some ridicule those who asked and they were appropriate questions too but yeah some teachers are good in that they answer questions and hi from a fellow marshmallow d
LifeProTips,not_removed,oh my gosh yes asking questions is so important it pains me when i see a line of people after class asking the professor questions that couldve been asked during class im no professor myself but i think id love getting a question that i know how to answer different ways
LifeProTips,not_removed,idk my professor once shitted on me in front of people for saying something wrong i thought if nobody knows the answer i try to conclude something but he just said something like wow thats the onl y answer you can think off you should go home this topic isnt anything for you months later i had the same professor in another class and he remembered me and still thought im an idiot and of course he threated me like the biggest idiot he has ever seen that motherfucker basically fucked my life with his words im already socially awkward and dont talk much but he embarassed me a few times in front of big crowds im never going to talk again if i dont know the answer for sure
LifeProTips,not_removed,im like that too i wonder if its a good or bad thing from another perspective
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats when it becomes funny
LifeProTips,not_removed,thats when you laugh it off as quickly as possible just shrug and laugh
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is like the saddest thing ive ever read about teachers that professor is a complete dick and i hope he learns how to fucking behave like a proper member of society i know it hurts like hell but dont let him ruin it for youyou can figure out and do anything you want to you made it this far and can keep going that guy needs to be taught how to not be a total jackass he shouldnt be allowed to teach impressionable young people if he cant control himself
LifeProTips,not_removed,i think its a good thing it keeps us more engaged with whats going on i definitely learn a lot more this way over time ive come to not care too much if i get a wrong answer it kills me when my teachers say somebody else answer
LifeProTips,not_removed,i also have a referal link which will give me towards my next purchase and off your first if you use it i didnt include it in the main body of the post because me saving money is not the point of this post though if you want to use this link thatd be dandy i also encourage other users who are already members to post their links here as replies to this one

LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt dont discuss your insecurities with random strangers
LifeProTips,not_removed,so for example ive been trying to make my penis bigger instead of i have a small penis
LifeProTips,not_removed,now you got it haha i was going to add if you dont want advice then dont talk about your insecurity with new people but i felt it went without saying edit however a good alternative after a few drinks is im trying to hook up with girls but my penis is tiny its tough getting girls to stay with me cause you cant change your dick size and never say this to a girl ever
LifeProTips,not_removed,i guess it means it looks bigger due to the low expectations if he gets one of them in bed
LifeProTips,not_removed,microwaves only affect water since that glass doesnt contain any water and its probably pyrex also that makes me think this is another old wives tale please post some proof
LifeProTips,not_removed,crack maybe melting glass seems a bit over dramatic
LifeProTips,not_removed,i agree i should have taken a picture before i threw the plate out but i assure it has happened to me personally yesterday
LifeProTips,not_removed,i dunno maybe its some kind of cheap glass its the cheapest microwave ever all i know is after minutes i opened the door to see the glass glowing red and sagging visibly later when it cooled it cracked
LifeProTips,not_removed,but arent you assuming that the microwaves are the culprit is it possible that someone dropped it and there was a hairline crack then put it back in the microwave then along you come put in your food hit the button and the weight of the food causes the hairline crack to turn into a full fledged crack and the plate is ruined that would be my theory
LifeProTips,not_removed,are you talking about the plate that comes in contact with the food or the rotating plate thats supposedly part of the microwave itself
LifeProTips,not_removed,sub pro tip never use a blacklight on that salvage couch or mattress you picked up for free
LifeProTips,not_removed,in my city there is a facebook group for things people offer to give away usually you have to organize pick up and transportation but hey free stuff and the city council also has a website where people can put up pictures of the things they want to give away its done to avoid trash
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt learn something useful at school so you can get paid job and not have to ransack trash
LifeProTips,not_removed,there was a story on npr about an affluent community that love picking up other peoples trash free stuff or maybe they charged for it from the waste company and even tried to not let people from outside the community from getting their trash i wish i could find it
LifeProTips,not_removed,this is a horrible lpt many trashdisposal recycling sites do not allow what you are suggesting once items are dropped off they are responsible for them theyre also responsible for the safety of idiots dumpster diving for goodies so no do jot encourage people to do this
LifeProTips,not_removed,can we get a sticky also this applies for termites ants and cockroaches check before snag
LifeProTips,not_removed,updated thats not what im talking about
LifeProTips,not_removed,i try not to argue with people instead i prefer to share facts or state an opinion most of the arguments i end up having are usually people who confuse facts with opinion and opinion with fact just because i share a fact i know to be true about something doesnt mean i support that thing i merely enjoy sharing what i know and when i say that i like overcast days because i find them relaxing i cannot be wrong no matter how much someone might try to claim i am
LifeProTips,not_removed,or sometimes its not worth argueing because you have different mentalities dont ruin a friendship over an irrelevant debate
LifeProTips,not_removed,also they could understand your point of view but are still trying to get you to understand their point of view sometimes there are no winners and its somewhere in between
LifeProTips,not_removed,fact is solidified opinion
LifeProTips,not_removed,but my point of view is correct because i say so so
LifeProTips,not_removed,and when i say that i like overcast days because i find them relaxing i cannot be wrong no matter how much someone might try to claim i am sure you can if you actually like overcast days because you look forward to the possibility of rain or if they actually make you cranky and rude even though you dont realize it then your statement is false
LifeProTips,not_removed,no you arent
LifeProTips,not_removed,did you just come here for an argument
LifeProTips,not_removed,if you actually like overcast days because you look forward to the possibility of rain i dont at all see how that proves his statement wrong
LifeProTips,not_removed,his claim is that he likes overcast days because he finds them relaxing if in reality he likes overcast days for another reason the original statement is not true the part about liking overcast days might still be true but that is only a part of the situation
LifeProTips,not_removed,hate to be that guy but this time its kinda important its the trial ill give it a look
LifeProTips,not_removed,assuming the trial was what you meant and absolutely agree one of my favorite books from high school would never have picked it up otherwise
LifeProTips,not_removed,the trial is a great book but be warned it is incredibly frustrating to read but thats the point it demonstrates how infuriatingly frustrating bureaucracy can be i also recommend invitation to a beheading by nabokov for similar reasons
LifeProTips,not_removed,i was just about to ask what the fuck the trail was about since im czech and kafka is basically obligatory reading for high school here cheers for that comment now i dont have to spend time looking for it
LifeProTips,not_removed,asked for a can of something stewardess unleashed a can of whoopass
LifeProTips,not_removed,lpt take an empty water bottle through security and fill up before you get on plane so you dont have to pay for a can or bottle of something if you get thirsty on a plane ftfy
LifeProTips,not_removed,virgin america nearly cry if you ask for a can
LifeProTips,not_removed,i once tried this on a quick delta flight i asked for a bottle of water and the stewardess told me to start with a cup and never returned in fact i am still waiting on my other of that bottle of water
LifeProTips,not_removed,australian budget airlines charge about for a bottle of water so a plt is to ask for a cup of water as its free
