MMA,removed,he would have if he hadnt suddenly turned into a wrestler
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up it wasnt a robbery at all it was a really close fight and in order for a new champion to be crowned the contender has to win the decision decisively not by a slim margin for example jones vs gustaffson
MMA,removed,i understand the guy is a bit of a dickhead but what does his physical appearance have to do with anything this just reeks of insecurity attacking someone elses appearance randomly
MMA,removed,alright im not a huge rousey fan never really was more of a jj champpvz fan in the womens division but i really want ronda to judo throw nunes breaking the canvas of the octagon that would be amazing

MMA,removed,seems like you tried really hard to minimize holms achievement ill bet you think rousey is attractive im predicting a rousey loss followed by a lb weight gain and a suicide attempt thats followed by another lb weight gain and the balls to actually kill herself
MMA,removed,today i fapped yet i just could not feel the rushes of dopamine i had been accustomed to i kept on stimulating my genitalia but felt nothing and simply could not maintain an erection after minutes straight of trying to cum to no avail i finally felt as if i was on the verge of a climax and with passion i punched my dick into submission i beat it until it wanted nothing more but death with great strength and perseverance i was finally able to reach the orgasm but instead of feeling the raw ecstacy of releasing my sperm cells i felt nothing my muscles were contracting and semen was being released yet i did not feel anything i cried myself to sleep trying to wait through my refractory period and hope my next orgasm could be betterï»¿
MMA,removed,do you understand what you are saying if im correct here you are saying that a few cuts on a fighters face causes them to lose enough blood that their bodys arent transferring oxygen properly come on man you really dont believe what your saying your just arguing to argue if you lost enough blood that the oxygen in your body was not transferring properly you would be dead end of story you have no arguement how many fighters do you know of that have bled out in the octogon dont be an idiot dude go back to your glock threads

MMA,removed,fuck your stupid cosby rape sweaters conor ya fucking douche bag
MMA,removed,funny cause its usually only casuals who dont recognize that the second figure is vic darchinyan an armenian former three division world champion in boxing i like peddling some tired ass memes too but this one is wrong and continuously spread

MMA,removed,thats a new one rockhold is an insufferably arrogant cunt because his dad is on his deathbed now ive heard every excuse in the book from team rockhold
MMA,removed,i did by screen shotting it is this all you have to do with your time worry about how strangers post pics on reddit your life must be awesome if the date in your user name is a birth year that means youre a year old give or take a year man knit picking about picture uploads grow up and move on
MMA,removed,you know its almost am here sure dude you a fight virgin on reddit know better than countless before you with expertise in this exact sort of thing i cant force you to believe nor do i think it is fact but i do think saying probably is the correct term something that seems to escape your binary mindset if i could make one suggestion is that since you seem so sure of yourself try taking an opportunity to explore a combative striking art yourself it might open up a new perspective on a lot of things for you noting signs that mark a fighter vs an athletic body not being least among them
MMA,removed,well being dead will do that
MMA,removed,fuck off with the holding up the division bullshit do you people ever stop moaning get a fucking life
MMA,removed,you stupid fuck

MMA,removed,thats exactly what i want him to dowhile i jerk off to a gif of him shooting on nate on an infinite loop and no im not kidding i dont care how many new fans the guy brought inim not one of them and i see no reason to replay a fight that had an extremely decisive finish
MMA,removed,i love how he gets morons like you worked up
MMA,removed,nobody gives a shit what you think
MMA,removed,get the fuck out of here that punch wasnt lucky you moron
MMA,removed,fact leslie smith was offered the fight with me a man and turned it down because i would cave in her tits cavity with my question mark kick the only question for leslie would be how long until the body shop installs her new tits in shed be a hurt bird after me face the facts
MMA,removed,if he is looking for make money and break records he is actively dodging his own division again man just fucking call it what it is you seem so willing to be blind and ignorant when it comes to mcgregor and it just doesnt make any sense he isnt going to kiss you he isnt going to tag you on instagram stop bending over for him for no reason
MMA,removed,lol morons getting upset that science is the way it is thats something that will never change
MMA,removed,you are welcome to try to insult me all you want but believe it or not it just makes your argument look even weaker anyways you are free to pretend that the guy who has never defended a title is looking for the hardest fights while fighting a gatekeeper at twice in a row just like i am free to think your parents could have been related

MMA,removed,go watch the fight again champ ive watched the fight and mendes dominated all the way until he went for a last ditch choke because he was slowly gassing due to his limited training camp youre providing zero sources to your empty claims get me sources and i guarantee they bring up the limited training camp regardless chad mendes virtually rag dolled conor whenever he wanted and mendes is a fw with a pitiful reach alvarez is not a manlet fw hes conors size and likely much stronger conor is not the favorite against anyone in the top at lw especially not when he gets his ass slapped around and choked out by diaz
MMA,removed,id let jessica eye speak english into my ass
MMA,removed,hes got aids
MMA,removed,if you dont understand the hour clock which im sure you do just add if the time is pm so becomes if the time is followed by letters this often indicates the time zone so et is eastern time which is gmt so grenwhich mean time minus hours also as with any sentence thats qualified with a symbol most commenly an asterix ie simply scroll to the bottom to find the equivalent symbol to read the clarifying or qualifying statement in this case due to cancellations early prelims have been rescheduled to start at pm edt however start times on the ufc page list both pm and pm we will try to update start times as information becomes available its all very simple really im not sure ive ever met anybody who doesnt get this stuff who doesnt have to wear a helmet outside of the house

MMA,removed,love the respect and that ass
MMA,removed,is literally the hitler version of
MMA,removed,more humping to the motherfucker
MMA,removed,this is an individual sport a lot of fans dont want to support fighters who are dickheads and bullies with shit personalities growing a pair or getting sand in manvaginas or whatever feminising insult youre trying to level towards people who dont want to be fans of arseholes says more about you than them youre basically ranting that people should like fighters the way you like them because their opinion isnt as good as yours rmma doesnt need to man up you condescending dickless twat you just need to accept that other people dont want to support dickheads
MMA,removed,it appears that everyone on this sub was under the impression that people lived forever hence the immense shock over the passing of a year old with parkinsons syndrome
MMA,removed,i can see it now its going to be just like happy gilmoure bisping and rockhold are both dedicating their fights to chubbs alis memory rockhold knows that hes alis star pupil but bisping still manages to get under his skin with ease shooter mcgavin bisping im gonna dedicate this victory in chubbs memory happy gilmore rockhold to hell with that idea im playing for chubbs shooter bisping nuhuh i called it first
MMA,removed,i hate how everyone has to post their shit little comments as if they are paying respects to the man commenting rip on reddit is not paying respects its phony and pathetic
MMA,removed,if you wrote rip or rest in peace or anything of that nature in here you are nothing but a fake little upvote whore
MMA,removed,hes in paradise now with virgins
MMA,removed,ive got some good news and some bad news the good news is they took muhammad ali off of life support
MMA,removed,fake
MMA,removed,draft dodging coward weak traitor
MMA,removed,hahah he ded now
MMA,removed,woah
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,lol stfu
MMA,removed,here on one side we have translucent skin stretched over an alien frame the gangly armed bastardcruzzzzzz annnnd on the other side we have a leprechaun without his surfboard the unhairy samsquanch faberrrrr
MMA,removed,it was not very effective
MMA,removed,nice time to make this about you
MMA,removed,you couldve just left it at rip because no one gives a fuck whether you liked him as a person or not
MMA,removed,you dont seem to understand american race relations
MMA,removed,lmao no you just made it very clear that you dont get it at all
MMA,removed,jones soundly beat cormier they still hate each other their rematch is the main event of ufc new here
MMA,removed,shame his daughter was such a cunt about ronda rouseys defeat
MMA,removed,just the other day i was wondering when hes gonna bite the dust overrated personality with very wonky idea
MMA,removed,who gives a shit yippie
MMA,removed,witcher did it better
MMA,removed,fuck off with your spam
MMA,removed,well clearly that life support machine isnt working
MMA,removed,are all of you people out of your minds bisping is going to get destroyed this is going to be embarrassing rockhold will do whatever he wants whenever he wants there is a bisping can even win an exchange let alone a round if he even escapes a round i always delete everything i post but im leaving this up till the fight just so you delusional motherfuckers dont forget how crazy you got just because this guy got creative with the trash talk
MMA,removed,lmfao new fans thinking people didnt care about technical skill before typical team mcgregors
MMA,removed,wow he farted what a fucking disgusting piece of shit i guess all mma fighters are like this huh just doing whatever they want whenever they want farting and shit look at his face he didnt even pay any attention to it or say sorry just hey smell my gas dude lmfao im a stupid mma fighter come here lets cuddle embarrassing really what a joke of a sport
MMA,removed,except for the part where he doesnt score against the elite tj dominated him and somehow he still managed to get decisions so obviously theres some prayer or maybe hes sucking off the judgesmuch more likely considering the person in question
MMA,removed,i doubt that tfak started in i doubt he was making big sponsorship dollars fighting lavar johnson on fx the big money hes talking about likely only happened for his last two or three fights theres no way he was pulling in massive dollars before that otherwise there would be more guys shitting bricks about losing hundreds of thousands of dollars there are way too many guys who seem only marginally bothered by the reebok deal schaub never fought under the reebok sponsorship though
MMA,removed,you realize that i chose the tag right lol i like a lot of different fighters i keep the mcgregor tag because i find it hilarious how butthurt people get if you didnt enjoy him in the ufc thats your problem every reply is identical shitposting mcnugget fans the actual irony is that people hate on mcgreggor way more than people circlejerk him idiotically within the mma community not talking mainstream
MMA,removed,what the fuck is your point here guy you think its some magical revelation that people do not make the same amount of money their entire career so fucking what before the reebok deal he made way more than after he did fighting with the ufc and it didnt have shit to do with his podcast you must be the only person who doesnt understand this hell even if what you are saying is true and it isnt that still doesnt mean he didnt lose a ton of money
MMA,removed,hey man no offense but i people would take you a lot more seriously and stop downvoting you if you were able to present your argument without sounding like a clown i know how tempting at can be but when you just declare things as the truth without any proof and then make fun of people who dont agree with your declaration people are just going to laugh and downvote you have a nice weekend
MMA,removed,or he left because he realized he would never be champ didnt want to fight anymore and his podcast was taking off so he finally had a viable alternative income this is not an answer to the portion of my post you quoted lol jebus i know the people in this forum arent the brightest but its always amusing when somebody thinks they are making a point
MMA,removed,dont speak ill of the dead unless its hitler
MMA,removed,i would like to respectfully eat that ass
MMA,removed,her asshole was hanging out what do ya want a guy to do
MMA,removed,aw someone piss is your cheerios lil fella or are you just ready for your nap
MMA,removed,its motherfuckers every year old has their cursing virginity popped within minutes of playing cs online why is shit still getting bleeped out
MMA,removed,think about all the mouthbreathers that would call him a pussy on social media as well
MMA,removed,it seems that way because brazilians tend to be a little bit less educated and used to living in third world mud huts where its okay to act like an animal
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,hey wwe fangirls no one gives a fuck about wrestling literally no one check the ratings for that garbage it was a joke based on the fact that merriman was a failed fake fighter also anyone in mma could very easily cut it in pro wrestling theres nothing inherently difficult about play fighting and no the schedule doesnt make it an insurmountable endeavour
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,i exposed you as being an unintelligent and uneducated minimum wage earning subhuman dont address me until you rectify your flaws little guy
MMA,removed,good lord ive never seen that many idiots at the bottom of an rmma thread is that what mcgregor is bringing to the sport if so ill pass and i say that as a fan
MMA,removed,no its the tone of your writing like youre red in the face pacing around the room even your riiiiiiiight is of the same tone drink a glass of water and stop being an autist unless you actually are one then i am sorry and go right ahead

MMA,removed,good gtfo you whiney fight ducking bitch
MMA,removed,so youre basically saying because aldo is a black belt on bjj and has been champion for a long time he would win times makes sense mcgregor will win over aldo times look at how difficult aldo had against chad mendes and how conor stopped him in round aldo wouldnt stand a chance against diaz so stfu
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,because women revel in illusions
MMA,removed,hahah fuck off base intellect are you serious you sound like a right barrel of laughs and i know the deal thats why i was speculating it may be fentanyl given its reputation for similar situations to this so now you are just arguing with a stranger for the sake of it im on my phone so i cant be arsed to look but the short of it was not all opiates have a signature structure thats why you have morphine but then you can have hydrocodone which is a different chemical structure and produces very different metabolites therefore you have to run separate tests
MMA,removed,travis brownlike in his woman beating joe
MMA,removed,i hope you are brutally gang raped by a bunch of angry black men
MMA,removed,he bet his ass like a dwarve among midgets
MMA,removed,i have a lot of respect for julianna for getting in that cage at all and for wanting fights against the toughest possible opponents i dont like to see dana trying to publicly shame fighters like this i dont think hes being respectful it all really comes down to respect thats what i want to see from fighters from the organizations and from fans alike
MMA,removed,it gets overlooked because its very much an overblown complicated situation he had taken nude photos of her without her permission this is legally a form of sexual harassment rousey then slapped him this is assault however rousey attempted to leave and the boyfriend jumped in her car and refused to get out this caused rousey to punch and kick him until he left this is where it is murky a person jumped into her car and refused to leave if a person of equal or larger size jumped in your car and you punched him until he left you probably wouldnt be prosecuted so really we have an open handed slap for creepy naked photos i dont really think this is on par with choking a bitch out when she picked up the wrong type of ramen
MMA,removed,im going to to be going out to a concert the night of what would be the easiest way to record the fights i was thinking of screencapping a stream or would just pausing it before i left work

MMA,removed,oh shut up calling out a fight out does not define you and it does not negate your personality if youre not typically calling people out up until that point you dont need to do it the conor way you can literally just say i think highly of this girl and i believe a fight with her would be the most exciting thing i can put out there for the fans no theatrics there but thats not even the important part here the important part is the way some fans still want to live the denial that prize fighting can thrive devoid of rivalries and some sort of beef its part of the nature of wanting to punch someone in the face and choke them out
MMA,removed,so the hot chick who hangs out with her real friends instead of other hot chicks she doesnt really like just to up her social status

MMA,removed,the sad thing is that conor essentially erased eddies legacy in a single fight you just do not come back from a loss like that ever he won his belt on fight pass and lost it on the biggest stage in mma history the taint of disgrace will follow his family for generations to come he will only ever be remembered for being humiliated by conor at when children look up alvarez on the extranet years from now it will read alvarez noun description bitch who did nothing

MMA,removed,i was watching this free on a shitty quality stream and tho i never seen his eyes clear enough i felt that about him too
MMA,removed,hes mentioned him once or twice there was a question during a press conference with aldo regarding the lightweight division and mcgregor said he felt khabib would have the belt by the time he would be challenging for it there was another snippet where a reporter asked about him possibly fighting his buddy khabib finally there was another mention during the ufc post fight scrum its hard to find the raw footage for the latter two so youll have to do some searching
MMA,removed,you mean youd rather be a douchebag
MMA,removed,aw would you ever shut the fuck up lol

MMA,removed,all detroit guys lookalike they all just nappy hair and uh goatees yeno

MMA,removed,nice of you to take the time to read my post history so that you can properly signal your lack of intelligence unfortunately you wasted your time because your entire post made it clear the god bless was just icing on the cake since you claim im dishonest heres a few facts for you cyborg is a known steroid cheat she was busted preusada when it was practically hard to get popped getting caught did steroids once it means she had been on steroids for an indeterminable amount of time and eventually got caught a respected nutritionist claims she could get down to safely ronda is a more popular fighter ronda is a smaller fighter a larger fighter calling out a smaller fighter is frowned upon in the fighting community and is generally considered a coward move all those things are true why does ronda need to fight a larger woman she fights in the weight class she was the champion she has nothing to gain fighting a huge steroid cheat youre fucking delusional
MMA,removed,if i said that bill gates didnt finish college so he could persue microsoft and then compaired that to someone else dropping out does that mean im comparing them to bill gates no it means im using an example of someone sucessful to a situation that people think you have to go through in order to gain success gsp didnt come from a wrestling background but turned out to be one of the best wrestlers in the ufc of all time im saying that is also a similar case for eddie alvarez who is a very good wrestler not the best but from what i would assume hes one of the best in the lw division and for your information im not a new mma fan and just because we have split opinions on who we prefer between conor and eddie and youve got your vagina in a knot over a comment on the internet it doesnt mean im a new mma fan
MMA,removed,no one has to accuse you of dumb shit you just keep spouting it off if you werent being a dumb shit why did you delete your comment

MMA,removed,btw ive been in a fight for my life slick and things ive learned from mma and the military helped me keep my composure during it and yet you are talking about how video games help in competition quit your bullshit also you arent nearly cool enough to pull off slick bitch

MMA,removed,daniel cormier is a grade a certified angus bitch remember what happened when he faced jj dc had to be brought into the ring hannibal lecter style and not because hes dangerous but because he was trying to flee the fight it took a force of men to even get dc into the cage and keep him there soon after a lighting strike hit the octagon and jj came forth he took off his hat to reveal that he had no pupils not unexpected from the prince of darkness dc immediately faked fainting to try to weasel his way out of the match but the ref wasnt fooled dc reluctantly got up still with tears pouring down his face and thought he found another opportunity to escape he kept repeatedly screaming out cain save me please but cain was too busy lying in the fetal crying barely muttering oh no not my knees please no oblique kicks please dont move up ranks to heavyweight i rule over all dominions of weight classes jj said now jj was done fooling around with a secondclass athelete like dc he simply pointed his finger at dc and this time dc got put away for good guess he shouldve been more careful about what he wished for this clip is nothing more than an anecdote a pathetic anecdote one does not scare a hooker with a cock ido portal
MMA,removed,since i see alot of the pricks putting ads on their youtube feed figured ill link one where it seems to be ads

MMA,removed,i searched for a good min and came up with nothing but her linkedin for anyone trying to find her avetisyan is her maiden name
MMA,removed,truth im i watched in a strip club in vancouver imo the one thing that separates us regular guys us fans from these amazing fighters is that look the look that says we battled in a fucking cage almost bare knuckled and you won but i loved every second of it when guys destroy each other and hug at theend that my friends is why ive been an mma fan since i was why my yr old son is a bjj blue belt word

MMA,removed,bro not cool with the q word
MMA,removed,thats because you wonderboy fucks deserve it if you were a woodley fan and you said tyron woodley actually seems like a good guy youd get downvoted to hell after the robbie fight
MMA,removed,clearly you do lol you downvoted thats pretty sad i dont want attention i just dont want some idiot telling me theyre going to to sue my employer in fact i asked you to show me when some one has been sued by the ufc for showing a highlight video and your response was well nothing really to do with that then because i didnt blindly listen to you when youve clearly made things up im now only after attention where did you come up with this do you want to win the gold in mental gymnastics

MMA,removed,lmao so lets get this straight if youre more excited for conor over youre not an mma fan get your ass out of your head dude there is no prerequisite for being an mma fan and he doesnt have to be excited for certain events to be a hardcore mma fan this type of attitude that most users have on this sub makes this place fucking unbearable sometimes
MMA,removed,better than life in a rat infested prison getting it deep and hard nightly
MMA,removed,oh stfu you rather have a ufc paid puppy asking him only pc questions
MMA,removed,she needs to cut to she is kind of short for just look at the height difference on her fight with andrea lee it also looks like she is above body fat and gassed a bit in that fight she could pick up on the cardiovascular exercise put down the spam musubi and drop lbs since she has dat spare booty the drop in body weight shouldnt be too much muscle mass
MMA,removed,god i love watching her she has such a great butt shes a perfect example of how fight kits ruin the art of this sport

MMA,removed,oh trust me i tried talking logic here but people were getting all chaffed jerking off to bj coming back i get following a legend but jesus christ rmma do people here seriously have absolutely zero common sense the man got lit the fuck up in every fight hes had recently but somehow he was gonna take an unorthodox prospect bjs gonna take him to round and yair will be tired im sorry guys santa clause isnt real the easter bunny isnt real and bj is years over the hill if you fans keep encouraging bj to come back hell be knocked into legit retardation
MMA,removed,thats how woodley took him down the first fight lol gtfo you casual
MMA,removed,for what why dont you use google to find out the difference between area codes and zip codes you fool
MMA,removed,educate yourself fool
MMA,removed,i do
MMA,removed,wrong she said it was not the arts like most conservatards yoy probably never attended college and thus dont know that term the arts means literature theater dance and so on not sporting competitions look it up nub utterly rekt your emotionally charged circlejerk and since youve already shown a tendency for fallacies no this doesnt mean that line wasnt still stupid
MMA,removed,whooooooosh she said it was not the arts like most conservatards you probably never attended college and thus dont know that term the arts means literature theater dance and so on not sporting competitions its separate from the word art as a concept look it up nub utterly rekt your emotionally charged circlejerk and since youve already shown a tendency for fallacies no this doesnt mean that line wasnt still stupid
MMA,removed,apparently yair is no longer at jackson wink
MMA,removed,wow ur a fucking dick dude its sad quite frankly
MMA,removed,i had hendricks winning both first fight i felt that every round was clear second fight the was the swing round i had it for johny close not very upset it went lawler though if it was pride scoring he would have won easily just another problem with the must system
MMA,removed,try quoting me with an actual quote that i said maybe now crawl back into the corner of a dublin pub and go on reddit you sad cunt
MMA,removed,somebody pm me when they release the video of tj gtfo
MMA,removed,the biggest lmao on you now aint it sucka
MMA,removed,what is actually funny about this is the fact that a smaller guy would shit talking a bigger guy let michael bisping tell you about the time him and cruz got drunk and almost got into a fight
MMA,removed,had to fix a typo you still didnt actually quote anything i said you you sad little prick
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,lovely casual military propaganda are you antiwar wrong you are antitroops

MMA,removed,oh yeah please tell me how you felt zero sympathy for those soldiers and how much easier it is to voice your antiwar sentiments im sure this was just a cute video with no agenda at all
MMA,removed,lord please let her be the first person to die in the octagon
MMA,removed,is it typical for the main card of fight night broadcasts to not be available on fight pass i was really enjoying the free membership trail this weekend and it was amazing for the prelims but having to switch to an unofficial stream for the main card soured it for me was this an exception or does it always work like that
MMA,removed,that sounds good and all but if youve seen as many fights as joe has you come to realize you can never be certain as what a result of a fight can be bringing it up in hindsight doesnt mean you absolutely knew what was going to happen you just thought you knew and the result may or may not reassure it in your simple little head the possibilities might be limited there still is always a chance i cant believe people still cant understand this about fighting to be fair its not like there is a year old middleweight champ with one eye oh wait nobody can know unless youre a goddamn time traveler if not shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,do you have any idea the amount of racist remarks he got on social media before he said that stop pretending to be fake outraged
MMA,removed,why should your illiteracy be funny to us i never understood these comments
MMA,removed,fuck this dumb bitch
MMA,removed,dont plan on swishy mcjackass fighting anyone like silva silva has a reach height advantage over the potato head the ufc is in the leprechaun business not in promoting a true competitive fight they dont want to make the mistake they made with drousey
MMA,removed,faber has them bumps on his stomach
MMA,removed,dad

MMA,removed,lol just stfu
MMA,removed,hey guys what i am doing is different there is no mma fighter that has a news site that is as hands on as i am i do all of the interviews and write some of the articles what you see mostly is fighters posting links to other sites like intimports and championsco to make extra money i am not doing that at all i only link my own site and not only do we share the same content that other news sites share we conduct interviews and have exclusives ourselves my connections and friendships within the community after years of fighting is gaining me better content to bring the fans closer than ever to the sport and fighters they love
MMA,removed,im still salty about the cage grabs
MMA,removed,im not a hippie green peace version im just not pretending this video is supposed to be informativeentertaining its pure and simple propaganda but sorry if calling it what it is makes you so defensive useful idiot
MMA,removed,just discovered the channel theres a vid on khabib that is better httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxnovadagslq
MMA,removed,man fuck you reddit you know im not wrong is crazy especially in a landscape where a positive test could be a mistake on the part of the testing company or something similar downvoting isnt for when you disagree with someone its for something that doesnt contribute to the discussion i gave my thoughts you dont like it then be a man and dispute it properly asshole downvoters
MMA,removed,im just asking a question here how many victories does nick diaz have over a fighter who was unanimously ranked in the top of the division at the time gomi perhaps maybe bj penn maybe young robbie lawler just crept in im just sayin it aint easy
MMA,removed,fight putlockerass
MMA,removed,hes got belts i never thought he could do it but he did
MMA,removed,its not an argument as much as it is an insult or a joke and he just turned it around on the guy he was replying to the same guy you took it from
MMA,removed,id find the holes in her guard
MMA,removed,lol i was just kidding with you whos raging here
MMA,removed,you think calling the ever weight world champion makes us nutthuggers get out of your butthurt weirdo head and open your eyes fool
MMA,removed,very hyped for this fight card
MMA,removed,are you aware i have a ritual called terminator i crouch in the shower in the naked terminator pose with eyes closed i crouch for a minute and visualize either arnie or the guy from the movie i then start to hum the theme slowly i rise to a standing position and open my eyes it helps me get through my day the only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg it sorta ruins the fantasy
MMA,removed,bless coco and his apprentice the flying jew

MMA,removed,you werent there you wouldnt know
MMA,removed,dude the guy took a dangerous fight on short notice risking his stock lol no he didnt the ufc and conor only dd that because they were convinced that conor could win and tout him as a force at three weight classes fuck off with this revisionism
MMA,removed,you stupid fuck he is doing it to get more people to donate putting ufc and reebok in twitter thats why he is announcing it
MMA,removed,yea when i have had to watch streams the quality sucks and theres a delay
MMA,removed,ah i cant reply now were getting
MMA,removed,aldo is such a bitch tho
MMA,removed,yeah i should work on being less tilted by idiots online or just flat ignore them its literally pointless to converse with you because what you say has no meaning either willfully or not you should work on a few things stop trolling like its your job theres more to life and if youre not trolling you need to fix your brain
MMA,removed,this is how you weed out the aldo cum guzzlers blowing bubbles with his semen first off there has never ever been a suggestion of conor being stripped that would only happen if he was juicing and spilling piss and calling the cops when usada show up conor will vacate the belt if he so chooses imagine aldo knocked conor out in seconds then imagine aldo is stripped for some reason and the belt is handed to mcgregor would you consider mcgregor the true champ like fuck you would youd be sitting there in a bath tub full of ado cum waxing lyrical about how aldo is the true champ it doesnt matter if mcgregor vacates or not he is the best pounder on the planet and hell either defend it or go take it back after vacating it when hes good and ready but dont pretend like that pussy aldo will ever be the true champ without facing mcgregor again a fight he will likely never get after pulling out when fit the first time then turning down the rematch after getting knocked out hes too much of a risk to not show up and when people think aldo hasnt been treated fairly by the ufc its because the ufc dont give a fuck about aldo and rightfully so after how much he fucked them over as soon as holloway or pettis get the interm mcgregor will go back down and remind everyone who the champ is i would never give aldo another headline on the biggest ufc card in history every mcgregor card after what he did
MMA,removed,ummajimedwards have you actually studied journalismwriting your threadtitles read like they were written by some sort of failed ai
MMA,removed,aldo will kill this guy im sorry aldo has bigger fish to fry like the assholes in ufc management aldo already kicked everyones ass he doesnt need holloway and conor is a fucking cheating champion weight cutter he is an opportunist for all this bullshit about him fighting anyone anytime he is so full of shit he will run from khabib and conor can only fight people smaller than him every division the guy is in he is the bigger fighter he is not brave and a badass he is an opportunist coward vote me down rmma but it is the truth and you can take that to the bank
MMA,removed,lol not reading all that shit bro but he is fucking ducking by fighting at other weights multiple fights in a row two not even for a belt you think he should remain champ by never defending the belt is just his now lmfao gtfo bro
MMA,removed,like he gives a fuck about some dead bums lmao
MMA,removed,if you didnt read the article youre a goof if you did read the article youre a goof and an idiot
MMA,removed,

MMA,removed,riot plz
MMA,removed,if cody wins though the harrassment i dish out is gonna get me banned im thinking my new name after that is gonna be dominicksnoozed

MMA,removed,you must be desperate to post here
MMA,removed,id still suck the fart out of her butthole in an instant

MMA,removed,miesha makes caraway clean her carpet too
MMA,removed,dat ass
MMA,removed,this sub is lame af so
MMA,removed,goddamn youre condescending go jerk off to ariannys ig
MMA,removed,youre clearly stupid so im going to try to explain it one last time for your small brain to comprehend if you cant understand any further i wish you good luck in your future endeavors because you clearly need it ufc has weight divisions so you dont have say a fighter against a these fighters also choose which weight class they want to fight as someone pointed out ww is mw would be and you can figure out the weight per division most fighters are purposely cutting weight so they can have an advantage on their certain division thats the fucking point to your ridiculous point about pulled out missing weight how many times has that happened so you want something that has a chance of happening to completely change the ufcs system so fighters that arent following their diets and getting proper trainers right the ufc isnt going to change to your idiotic system because a few fighters cant fucking do their job properly all these guys can purposely not cut a single pound and fight at their walking weight like roy nelson if they want but most people choose and i repeat choose to fight at a certain weight class for an advantage
MMA,removed,this makes me want to find a stream
MMA,removed,too
MMA,removed,lol i am rooting for cruz but i agree with you cody didnt freak out assholes downvoting you
MMA,removed,thats exactly why in the entire full interview cruz was lost for words he kept babbling like a high school kid when theyre proven wrong then he tries to punch cody at the weigh in so whos in whos head even when the physical evidence is there you guy still polish his beanbag unreal
MMA,removed,too
MMA,removed,dude dont bother posting against cruz in this sub reddit youll only get downvoted lol its full of cruz ballsack ticklers cruz was shut down in the full interview and you could see he was annoyed when cody kept smiling hes used to getting a reaction and then is used to talking over the top of them in an articulate fashion then it pisses the opponent off cody was annoyed at the personal shot of his girlfriend as any guy would be its a natural instinct but in the cases of them talking about fighting each other cruz was babbling struggling to find words when cody brought up his points cody is going to batter cruz mark my words check through my recent comments cruz nutsack boys ive analysed it enough in the essays ive wrote cannot wait until tomorrow
MMA,removed,when cruz is the one acting like the bully hahahaha talks over the top acting like he knows it all when in really he is as pseudointellectual as this sub reddit he states the most basic points in an articulate manner making him appear smarter than he is you could clearly see how affected he was just nodding his head saying mmm when cody brought up many legitimate points cruz is used to getting the first word in and the last word but it didnt work this time even more so its obvious because he got a statistic wrong saying cody has never faced a top guy then his last resort is bbut youve never ffaced a top guy did you not see him lost for words in the minute interview now hes even gone to throw a punch at the weigh in he hasnt even acted like this against faber what was all that talk about controlling yourself funny when you cruz butt boys are all blinded by favouritism paydays tomorrow boys cruz is faking composure banged out
MMA,removed,because this rarely happens its very rare you get an opportunity to prove of the people tuning into a fight wrong im as invested as all you cruz butt boys are because i love the sport just listening to all the hypocrisy coming out of cruzs mouth and cruzs fans mouths is hilarious the funnier thing is no one notices they sound like a total moron victory is never going to taste so sweet
MMA,removed,another high school insult what a surprise it came from a cruz nuthugger
MMA,removed,who gives a shit about what happened prefight continues to comment about how cody left the interview are you really that ignorant
MMA,removed,another quality insult no wonder you guys love cruz so much hes as psuedointelligent as you guys are here on this sub reddit
MMA,removed,repeating the same thing over and over continues to say crappy high school insults as well as only mentioning how cody will just hit air and get taken down
MMA,removed,where chael talks about iteven chael admits its not that exciting of a story basically forrest is close to the ufc offices and puts in hours a day five days a week
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,oh fuck off whens the last time mcgregor left a stage with out saying anything
MMA,removed,are you sure youre not just scared of masks little buddy

MMA,removed,too
MMA,removed,there is no doubt that the ufc uses preferential treatment towards fighters since other fighters have been compensated when their opponents got pulled i also think the fighters are signing contracts that dont protect them against these types of situations werdum is on the ufcs shit list for speaking out against reebok etc
MMA,removed,im searching for it it was on raw regal was teaming with lance storm against kane and i think rvd ill see if i can find it

MMA,removed,it was because hes tough and durable common trait in a white athlete
MMA,removed,glad that tito fucked his ass like that no problem chael is a shit talking little bitch
MMA,removed,ah yes its ulommygreenhands why am i not surprised
MMA,removed,its because hes always been dana whites friend
MMA,removed,lol what do you expect from this dude just go through his comment history on this sub
MMA,removed,so youre saying conor didnt do something thats never been done in ufc or mma history thats literally why you all downvoted me and youre responding to posts in a row defending your one true god lol
MMA,removed,oh weird chicubs said he chose to move up a weight class and fight rda so i was assuming i missed it
MMA,removed,i deadlift quite often but thanks for the condescending comment asshole hes using a fucking hexbar hardly anyone uses those for high reps granted with his form i doubt he follows other conventional lifting techniques
MMA,removed,racism oh wait
MMA,removed,im talking about rda you troll conor did not sign to fight diaz initially he challenged the best lw there was at the time
MMA,removed,outside the featherweight division you fucking dunce
MMA,removed,wow we all know youre very confused no need to make it that apparent
MMA,removed,hes trolling rather successfully
MMA,removed,you had me at dicks fuck assholes
MMA,removed,comment discrediting conor with downvotes who could it be oh of course its good ol lommy honest to god do you have a life outside of this
MMA,removed,i just cant help but think trump also helped get him the rematch most of their fans would overlap
MMA,removed,yea it gets me so hard too
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,did you watch his really early fights he was like i think hold on ill find a link is all his first something like that fights fight one brutal fight hes submitted actually watch it thing is he doesnt seem to get done twice by the same trick thats what makes him great imho
MMA,removed,thats hilarious thanks newbie question here what happened to phil davis
MMA,removed,i feel bad for people like you who need finishes in mma to be interested in a fighter its alright little buddy
MMA,removed,war bangbus
MMA,removed,we are talking about back from when george first lost to matt serra looks like you dont red gud alright
MMA,removed,he doesnt give any real evidence except a clip of the signaltap which you can see from the clip happened right after chael released the darce and went back to gable grip not before and his speculation that its something chael would do since chael only cares about politics and being a frontman at bellator and not a fighter
MMA,removed,just watch something else then and stfu
MMA,removed,whathe got caught and fedor was getting the better of him on the feetpeople talk about fedors losses when anderson and gsp lost on their physical prime to average competition
MMA,removed,fuck you
MMA,removed,not what you are talking about but similarly his opponents before and after fighting him
MMA,removed,im talking about how that guy is bragging about how hes a stripe white and can defend a choke you idiots have never competed in an mma match and are criticizing this to be fixed stfu
MMA,removed,right so youre not just an idiot who makes baseless assumptions and then invents imaginary arguments from them youre also a cunt gotcha
MMA,removed,we got an idiot here guys get him
MMA,removed,lmao ya okay so somehow chael is stronger than tito stopped reading after your first sentence
MMA,removed,fuck off with that shit
MMA,removed,christians are full of double speak and bullshit dont believe any of it let the guy keep lifting like an idiot he will reap the benefits of arthritis
MMA,removed,work harder lube that asshole up
MMA,removed,thats video follows all dans tweets and explains everything
MMA,removed,why is he not wrong sage is a freak athlete is that fucking racist
MMA,removed,this is ridiculous woodley has issues
MMA,removed,it will probably be on rmmastreams
MMA,removed,its not a weird excuse dick head the fight looked fixed but who knows you cant just say people are finding a excuse because they dont like tito like you know half the subs opinion
MMA,removed,tito is also a gaping asshole
MMA,removed,your edit is more racist than anything said in the thread typical woodley keeps bringing up racism in the sport but is very quick to say i dont have notes when asked to provide examples
MMA,removed,you completely discredited your argument anyway according to the other poster the judge you said gave woodley a for the first scored the a the judge has no credibility anymore gtfo
MMA,removed,urustymechanism seeing as you deleted your comment ill post my reply here youre assuming a lot about me based on one comment i do not think any black person is correct and i didnt say shit about whites not listening stop trying to tell me how i feel because im backing up tyron youre strawmaning the shit out of me right now i agree that there are problems with what he said about cardio and i think that hes missed the point with that particular comment but he is right that black athletes get a lot of subtle and nuanced discrimination in the way theyre treated and talked about you dont have to dismiss everything hes said based on one thing you disagree with like i said i disagree with that element too but its not the core of what hes trying to say
MMA,removed,dance monkey dance
MMA,removed,jones looks two weight classes up in this clip if you want to see jon look weight classes up watch this he looks shredded compared to his recent grappling match with dan hendo
MMA,removed,people like him use the race card to get shit they want but refuse to earn like everyone else
MMA,removed,people like him have been trained to believe in a false narrative so theres a confirmation bias that every little negative experience they have in their lives is attributed to some kind of racism instead of personal behavior or some other issue same with nutty feminists that think everything bad that happens to them is because of sexism
MMA,removed,cool but what do clean and jerks and snatches have to do with deadlifting
MMA,removed,bout done reading about this pavement ape
MMA,removed,tell this guy to fuck off hes champ how racist can america be black athletes are revered its mma not politics gtfo and stfu coming from an asian whos tired of sjw shit
MMA,removed,fuck off cunt
MMA,removed,dont forget trump supporter as well
MMA,removed,virtue signalling sjws
MMA,removed,tyron i have a dream woodley
MMA,removed,plus hgh and other anabolics
MMA,removed,including skin color or does that not matter
MMA,removed,the people who disagree think hes on tons of roids so thats white privilege i guess lol white privilege fuck off with that shit he isnt a freak because he isnt beating anyone let alone everyone so to cry white privilege is such a fucking cop out feel ashamed because you should
MMA,removed,mma culture is magaville
MMA,removed,the ufc only ever has ppv draws who are colored jon jones and anderson silva they are and goat and even with that they are inferior draws than their white colleagues with lesser ability other than those two there is only one other colored mma star kimbo slice but he is only a free tv star not a ppv star there is a difference the ufc absolutely doesnt care if money comes from a white guy or a black guy the reason why black fighters are treated worse generally is because they bring less revenue white people who doesnt bring revenue are treated badly as well black people for the most part cant afford ppv or ticket thats just a fact and its not the ufcs fault about racism it absolutely does exist in a large scale in america the blatant showing of racism is less seen because its either banned or frown upon but the thought or more subtle showing a racism really dont change much from the past i am a minority who lived in the us for nearly years in many different cities and the racism i received is undeniable even though subtle i have always leaning toward racism is natural but even if its not natural its surely inevitable in the current society i have no problem with woodley talking about i even think its healthy to talk about but when you are a month out of your fight which means in the most important part of training camp the last thing you want is distraction i suspect woodley will come out horrible in this fight
MMA,removed,but they clearly dont matter as much as you showed in your funny comment so dont be surprised when they dont care about your issues as well
MMA,removed,of course the swede thinks this
MMA,removed,trump so selfless
MMA,removed,white redditors plz no
MMA,removed,nah u can fuck off with ur white belt shit convince someone else u know what ur talking about
MMA,removed,this community is proof hes right when people reduce the very real harmful and dangerous social condition that is racism to pulling a card like its a fucking game life is not a game i dont expect rmma to change any time soon this place is pretty much overrun by maga types but ill be in the threads willing to discuss it
MMA,removed,lommygreenhands gunning for mcgregors whole clan
MMA,removed,i never said he was a good dad his own son says he is a good dad ya fucking autistic goof
MMA,removed,i think youre seriously overestimating how much of that effect there is
MMA,removed,hey lommy
MMA,removed,hmm as a black man it wasnt until around the age of or that i was finally able to shed these kinds of insecurities our differences create them and the education system reinforces a victim mentality i literally saw racism everywhere i cared to look i remember being angry most of the time it wasnt until i understood my self worth that i let all that petty bullshit go after reaching that evolutionary save point even the dreaded n word lost all power over me heres hoping he can evolve because if he ever gets his mind right he could become legendary
MMA,removed,a child abusers be careful with all your stretching you might pull a muscle
MMA,removed,i didnt realize this sub was such a liberal shithole microaggressions seriously we are talking about people who literally cage fight for a living and we are bringing up microaggressions maybe we should change the name to the ultimate fighting safespace
MMA,removed,ah a true shitstain just like his seed and im sure just like every mcgregor to come before him
MMA,removed,why cant he be upset about this why is the fact he wants to talk about this mean hes a victim and should shut up because it makes white people feel uncomfortable wont somebody think of the white people
MMA,removed,who hurt you
MMA,removed,off course hes not wrong hes not breaking any law he can talk about whatever the fuck he wants if i was a ufc fighter as a male i could sit there and whine all day about the struggles i faced being a shorter male and i wouldnt be wrong either there are definitely micro aggressions i face being shorter than average i would still get loads of hate because its just not the type of character you admire in a fighter hes allowed to say what he wants but so are the fans and when he is accusing us fans directly of disliking him due to racism off course we are gonna turn around and point out his bs its not just about whether racism exists or not the ufc along with a sport is also popularity contest now look at the current political climate in america over the last few years as pc culture has become bigger stronger and more annoying than ever so has the hate for pc culture donald trump is fucking president because of how sick people are with pc culture so if you are constantly bringing up issues such as racial microaggressions which is heavily rooted in pc culture what do you really expect maybe ten years ago the backlash wouldnt have been as bad because that culture hadnt seeped in as deeply as it has now but now people are simply sick of it
MMA,removed,in that case do you think conor is going to abuse his newborn and is that ok
MMA,removed,haha yeah its fun to do vince mcmahon does it for his entrance too
MMA,removed,nothing to do with my father its just a good story of how conor knew he was going to be great
MMA,removed,i remember this i remember seeing donald trump there at the intro i dont remember thinking hed ever be president sad
MMA,removed,nah give trump a term and a half and i think people might finally realize they have been served a load of bullshit
MMA,removed,choke on my dick
MMA,removed,its not just genetics some of us have condishuns asshole
MMA,removed,im probably gonna have to go the toilets at lunch time and jack off to embedded
MMA,removed,buncha anderson silva nuthuggers who actually believed the fraud wasnt cheating his entire career hating on hendo did hendo take trt yes was trt legal yes was trt complete bullshit and unfair yes but hendo did it legally and got off when they made him anderson has been a fraud the whole time mr positive test should be banned for life he popped different time and take xanax during diaz fight hendos more of a man then anderson silva will ever imagine being

MMA,removed,fuck that racist pollack bitch
MMA,removed,did joanna grow up next to a nuclear reactor that asshole skin she got round her eyes is awfulï»¿
MMA,removed,the heavy stuff is important possibly the most important especially for guys like cerrone that by his own admission sometimes have a hard time starting up or showing up to work ha if you paid any attention to the interviews that cerrone has done after the rda fight youd know that the heavy stuff has nothing to do with his slow starts one of the most significant perhaps the most significant benefit of sparring is the mental aspect so youre telling me that a guy with professional bouts is going to lose his mental aspect of fighting because he is sparring heavily less holy fuck i dont even know how to respond to the bottom of your argument due to the fact that you claim dc has learned to shoot for singles and doubles after taking heavy shots like that has something to do with the stand up aspect of fighting you have yourself a great day pull your head out of your ass

MMA,removed,cucksport
MMA,removed,you clearly have no idea how serious a knock out can be a typical keyboard warrior with no martial art experience talking like hes the top fighter what a joke
MMA,removed,very relevant
MMA,removed,all you did was prove my point your being a fuckin hipster stop it
MMA,removed,saying the ward fight was alright and saying he would rather watch a bellator fight nobody in the world gives a shit about is the definition of a sports hipster its like saying you would rather watch a regular season hockey game over game of the finals dont do that you are always gonna sound like a dickhead
MMA,removed,no one cares about your opinion though not your mom or your dad or the crust rag you jack off into
MMA,removed,dong hyun kim vs marco polo reyes was a greatttttt fight but is overlooked for fight of the year cause it was on fight pass early on a card any other suggestions

MMA,removed,fuck that hes an asshole i came up with the name of his podcast show after he asked for suggestions took my idea and never thanked me and blocked me from twitter after i asked for recognition
MMA,removed,you seem to have missed the joke most of conors fans are irish and only idiots think conor koing aldo counts as closure since most of the people that think that are conor fans than irish arent very smart
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,yet he is working like a mad man selling wolf tickets lorenzo and i used to divide and conquer with him gone im going to have to pick up a lot of the stuff he used to do

MMA,removed,lol i saw his post history anyone who criticized ronda gets called an armchair psychologist this idiot doesnt even see it any normal person can see edmond is her daddy now
MMA,removed,bet she cant beat ronda though
MMA,removed,why wouldnt he he trains boxing jiujitsu and judo and talks a lot of shit on fighters and likes to fight in the streets so he needs to man up and step up justinbieber
MMA,removed,you put a lot of work into that conors nuthuggers are a loyal and dedicated bunch

MMA,removed,i think this was after tuf exploded in popularity so maybe vince got a bit worriedregretted allowing tuf to be shown after raw its also more likely vince wanted goldberg as a commentator and not just to no show a ufc event also this story has been circulating for years a quick google shows it goes back at least to
MMA,removed,im sure meisha doesnt let himknow what gonna stop right there

MMA,removed,i say this because i recently moved into my own flat about months ago after living with my mom for years ive always been big and about months ago i decided to start really going for it i had my ups and downs but never really lost weight i kept thinking to myself that i was too fat and that i was too depressed to lose weight i felt depressed because although my mom wasnt abusive she always made little comments towards me like youre too lazy get out and get a life you shouldnt be sitting on your arse all day or why are you always eating thats why you get out of breath walking to the shop i always just brushed them aside but the last one really stung but ever since i moved out ive seemed to have more confidence about me and seem to be more determined to lose weight in the last months i lost more than double than i did in the prev months living with my mum i dont know if this is the case for everyone but i found that having someone belittle you just makes you depressed and for me just made me give up so if youre struggling to lose weight maybe look at your surroundings and think is that the problem hahahahahahahahahahhaha
MMA,removed,hey dinesh nice chain do you choke your mom with it when you put your penis in her butthole

MMA,removed,one of the bigger free options is hola but loads people warn against using this one because there are some serious privacy concerns having to do with your computer essentially being turned into an exit node for other users you could also try zenmate if youre looking for a free version i believe its limited to a few countries unless you pay for premium however if youre willing to pay a few bucks or quid per month id recommend just signing up for a vpn because its simpler than tor and safer than free proxies last time i checked rvpn voted totalvpn and purevpn as their top choices heres a great httpsthatoneprivacysitenetvpncomparisonchart made by a redditor if you want to see what else is out there finally heres the honest truth about what i use fightpass location spoofing is literally the only time i need use a proxy and in that particular case you only need to have the proxy active for a few seconds max to achieve the desired result with that in mind i use hola even though everyone whos intheknow is so up in arms about it the concerns over holas privacy have to do with other people around the world using your internet connection to viewdo illegal things online its not about people gaining access to your actual computer or being able to take control of your system because i only need to use a proxied location for the few seconds it takes to fool the fightpass ufctv servers i flip the hola chrome extension on for less than a minute and then uninstall it or just disable it in chrome when im through with it im not saying you should do that but thats the truth about what i do

MMA,removed,cucked
MMA,removed,its unbelievable eh i moved flat just before ufc and my bt wasnt setup on time so i couldnt watch it the worst thing was the service was activated but i forgot to add bt sport on so i phoned them to do it and they couldnt because although the service was running the order technically wasnt completed therefore they couldnt amend it ended up having to stream it despite offering to pay extra to get it up and running lol

MMA,removed,kinda disappointed you didnt link to bjpenncom i mean if there ever was a story to do so this was it
MMA,removed,right the news which was brought up by chael was done after the coke incident however he said it was a few years ago you said he crashed his car into a woman making it seem like he intentively saw a woman in a car and crashed into her it was cash that he went to grab not even weed youre right in that he left his weed pipe behind he didnt have an estrogen blocker prescription it was found in his boner pill i understand reading may be difficult for you and i believe usada will start publicizing their results in colouring books with little pop up sections for dimwits like you to properly understand thats pure speculation bonus round no a few minor fuck ups like after demolishing the lhw champion and defending the belt at he started partying got involved with the wrong crowd started doing coke drove home from the morning after party hungover had a brain fart thinking a green light was a green turning light and going got paranoid about whether or not he was still drunk and ran on top of that having circumstances really not in his favor such as the driver of the other car being a woman who was also pregnant taking boner pills and getting accused of peds for estrogen blockers etc stop foaming and stfu you havent a clue of what youre saying
MMA,removed,all i heard was mumbles with that dick so far down your throat
MMA,removed,he says he never used it during competition he also said he never knowingly used steroids thats a quote right from him on this forum hes obviously a liar and that discredits anything he says on the subject if he didnt post on this forum people would be a little more objective about it i think

MMA,removed,mate what should really blow your mind is although you feel like every american with irish heritage is out in the streets in green proclaiming their love for the old country really thats just a tiny percentage the vast majority of americans with irish heritage are too embarrassed by irelands insistence on letting the british endlessly fuck them in the arse to want any connection to eire

MMA,removed,i got a boner man straight outta stompton
MMA,removed,we did it reddit
MMA,removed,never underestimate the daterape effects of a good strong cologne

MMA,removed,miesha tate was a massive bitch to ronda rousey for two years taking potshots at her every chance she got in interviews and social media you dont just get to stick your had out at the end and all is forgiven
MMA,removed,hey guys these jews are happy that hitler just lost the war these jews must be terrible people peggy morgan
MMA,removed,callen is legitimately a bitch boy
MMA,removed,lol go watch the interviews from their original fight ronda started the feud and said by far the worst shit through all of it and like a true crazy person was the one who couldnt move past it completely false lol youre straight making that up ronda rousey was saying let the pretty girls fight this will be great for wmma etc miesha tate was taking potshots at her then after she lost wouldnt let it go rousey never said another word about tate after that fight miesha tate made personal attacks every chance she got
MMA,removed,dont feel bad im sure he feels great he is pounding mieshas sweet ass
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,i think you may just have discovered an untapped market niche undetectable clit protectors thank me when youre a billionaire

MMA,removed,if you see this commenter above me who had the vagina and deleted his post youre a vagina for deleting your post cant even anonymously stand up to being an idiot damn son
MMA,removed,any retards out there left who still think she could ko mayweather also tate is hot as fuck
MMA,removed,one of the nicer things she said about meisha in ronda defense shes not wrong caraway is a chode and should not be training her
MMA,removed,i still think the worst one of all in this period was the ring magazine ignoring a legit boxing champ like holm and putting ronda on the cover instead
MMA,removed,whoa
MMA,removed,i get what you mean by physical differences but you gotta remember floyd is somewhat scrawny no real big power difference there these women that are competing arent tiny little flowers theyre built strong and can give a mean whooping do you assuming dude think youd be able to beat ronda in her prime im foot and have no problem saying times id lose ps i dont like ronda at all
MMA,removed,yeahin no way will manishs fight strategy be thinking about how the hundreds of thousands of south asian migrant workers are treated in bahrain
MMA,removed,providing evidence to back up a position lol such hard most difficult hey bitchboy thats how your argue things as opposed to your little friendhero who just said something happened without being able to support it i know in bitchboy land thats how its done but then again thats why youre the bitchboy whats worse the idea that i might live vicariously through her or the fact that you thrive on believing a lie about her because you hate a random sports figure youve never met
MMA,removed,i buy almost every ppv
MMA,removed,what stage of the grieving process are the cruz fans in today we started with denial the judges got it wrong then we had changing the subject cruz was so amazing in the post fight press conference and then more denial but cruz totally destroyed him verbally have all you smug cruz fanboys finally accepted that he got totally schooled clowned and bested at his own game by cody who you all dismissed as a dumb meat head
MMA,removed,no stop thats not how any of this works connor is the lw belt now which means he defends the lw belt the idea that his opponent has to have something to offer him is ridiculous you know what his opponents offer him now the opportunity to defend his damn belt no more of this i fight who i want when i want bullshit he needs to step up and start behaving like a champion not a spilled brat rhonda behaved like a spoiled brat and look where she ended up connor had duty to defend the fw belt and he failed thats why no serious fan will ever take his division champion reign seriously it would have been different if he had defended the fw belt a single time in the year he had it but he didnt no your saying he can hold up another division again no just stop you defend the belt end of discussion
MMA,removed,gabi garcia is such a shit roided up cunt for taking these rights embarrassed for her it even took that long
MMA,removed,seriously whats with all the talk about ppv buys draws big money fights headliner stars are they fight fans or finance fans any fight involving doo ho choi yair rodriguez wonderboy cowboy aldo tony ferg joanna mousasi and many more excite me just as much as any conor or big draw fight fuck your money and fuck your ppv buys and fuck your mother
MMA,removed,prefer this video hehe
MMA,removed,nice
MMA,removed,i really want her to kill herself
MMA,removed,and expert corning during fights
MMA,removed,ive always been turned on by the shape of her body
MMA,removed,still wants to be able to wipe the cum off her belly with hundred dollar bills hes living the good life with that ronda rousey money hard to hate on him except that he comes across as an asshole
MMA,removed,if ronda does decide to move to another gym where should she go curves
MMA,removed,you just know whos gonna want that first belt right
MMA,removed,ariels ulterior motives that jew
MMA,removed,retarded douchebag
MMA,removed,he never danced in the ring as he dominated but then was super humble and put the title around a child cancer survivor that motivated his success for a start also in general while cruz was great at shittalking it was not in a way that casuals would particularly be into like with conor it works for conor because hes a living leprechaun and absolutely ridiculous whereas cruz just comes across generally as an arrogant pseudo intellectual with a somewhat nasally voice i would say played right cody right now is way more marketable than cruz
MMA,removed,in other words hes an armenian
MMA,removed,he has wins over the greatest kickboxer of all time he just is cashing in on his previous fame while preserving his brain by giving up the first time he is hit he has been doing this for about years now and keeps getting booked
MMA,removed,thank god for mental illness
MMA,removed,you know someone is an idiot when a guy with mcgregor flair is acknowledging it
MMA,removed,in what universe its been a revolving door of champs ever since bj penn regressed the division is a joke
MMA,removed,nobody is being a dick here its called banter your reading of people and situations is poor
MMA,removed,how dare you its the metaphtsical anatomy of the architectural dissonant narrative of ronda rouseys defeat by the monday morning analist big words small mind
MMA,removed,yeah im a retard all fixed my first blog my reflections of ufc

MMA,removed,lol how did jon or dc not put bystanders in danger moron jon pushed scholler to the ground and then they brawled to the ground with people all around them it wasnt a on fight it was a brawl that involved a large amount of that crowd i never said they didnt but you think conor potentially hitting someone with a bottlecan is worse especially when nate threw the first bottle you clearly are the one thats bias seeing as you spend most your life on reddit hating on mcg how youre claiming jondc didnt put any bystanders in danger shows how moronic you are you must of a few grand betting on aldo or something youre sodium levels are way too high when did i say it was worse i think theyre just as bad as each other and roughly equivalent punishments make sense nate deserves the same punishment for instigating it i dont hate on mcgregor i like him i hate on his dipshit fans of which youre clearly one
MMA,removed,are you jelous because of the growing insecurity about ageing you once looked that young too it sucks
MMA,removed,if you havent already i recommend tagging this dude as a troll

MMA,removed,dirty slag
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,then youre just an idiot dont put your stink on the rest of us
MMA,removed,shut your mouth
MMA,removed,i like your style of comment much more its the anticonor timetm comment which is to say any time people say they think conor will win you come around to remind people that conor fans are the worst i mean its just retarded conor fans right its not like firas zahabi or any objective analyst has also concluded that conor has a very strong chance at knocking alvarez out you can certainly argue you think alvarez is going to win but acting like someone thinking conor will knock him out early is purely fanboying is ridiculious
MMA,removed,later cunt
MMA,removed,seems more like kind of gal to me
MMA,removed,what a wretched cant eat shit pat
MMA,removed,you must be dumb as fuck the reason people were so mad at tyrun was because the minute he won the title he was telling wonderboy to go fight lawler and started campaigning for gsp or diaz thats not the same situation as nate waiting for a money fight because nothing else is as appealing
MMA,removed,nope

MMA,removed,absolute embarrassment dude just shut the fuck up because you have no clue
MMA,removed,you are such a dick you got incredibly over defensive over something so small and youre not even right why do you think they throw in their towels it ends the bout by disqualifying them retard
MMA,removed,so fucking stupid
MMA,removed,exactly i think its two things first you can really carefully modulate the hurt which actually lets you go a lot deeper without redlining its like edging when youre jacking off or something second theres a real joy to speed its almost like flying put the two together and you can really really go deep

MMA,removed,would a fighter be able to have a tattoo that said white pride on his chest like cain velasquez has brown pride tatted on his chest
MMA,removed,i cant find a working stream for the life of me
MMA,removed,just wait and torrent or check a few of the other i cant name them cuz ill get banned subreddits to find a bunch of free streams if youre athosting a party then youre going to have to shell out the buku bucks

MMA,removed,these fights are streaming for free pm me for link
MMA,removed,basically
MMA,removed,i hate that little rascal
MMA,removed,martin kampmann is commenting on the danish viaplay stream im swedish though so i cant try listening and im sticking to rogangoldie

MMA,removed,thanks to anyone who replied but i just started using a free stream and i didnt even think theyd be an option for how much traffic thered be today but so far its perfect so might just commit to those then have to cop the if it fucks up too much before aldo
MMA,removed,i think im the only one rooting for browne
MMA,removed,ya know ufc i paid to watch your event it would be nice if you would have courtesy of giving me any stream so that i could

MMA,removed,conor said a rubber match later down the road not immediately

MMA,removed,maybe go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,dm help hint hint please with love
MMA,removed,i have a weird feeling well be seeing a highlight reel ko from anderson
MMA,removed,ah the salty edgar fanboys can finally shut the fuck up now such a glorious day
MMA,removed,i predicted the dillashaw over barao win i predicted the jj win over esparza i predicted the conor win over aldo i predicted the holly win over rousey i predicted the bisping win over luke i predicted the alvarez over rda win i have that same bizarre feeling that anderson will win and nunes will win
MMA,removed,holly losing was most recent
MMA,removed,automod fails drug test
MMA,removed,jesus dadbod silva

MMA,removed,this card is horrible i hope nunes kos miesha to top the night off so rmma ends up whacking off with their tears
MMA,removed,ahahaha what happened to hunt knocking brock out hunt had to grab the fence and dig his fingers into brocks eyes ahahahaha fuck hunt eat shit you fat bitch
MMA,removed,whats wrong in your life little buddy
MMA,removed,steroids and acai
MMA,removed,im watching the uk stream there was an ad that said quick quid short term loans was calculated at interest rate wtf
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,meisha nip slip can save the night im weak
MMA,removed,uh he didnt even say that i guess youre too retarded to understand that though you must be some overly emotional prepubescent moron to get so worked up when someone has a differing opinion to you its kind of ironic you say a misinformed generalized statement when youve attacked someone when not even understanding their full opinion grow the fuck up douchebag
MMA,removed,nunes is going to ko miesha and rmma will be whacking of to their tears tonight
MMA,removed,lol fuck off
MMA,removed,it looks like nunes is on the brazilian diet acai and steroids
MMA,removed,you shut your whore mouth
MMA,removed,no shit we need something to happen
MMA,removed,alot of salt in the discussion thread when dc fought a smart against silva i thought excellent wresteling contril punctuated by wild exchanges was still a cool fight but apparently cormier is an asshole according to this sub because he didnt stand and bang with the best striker in the ufc
MMA,removed,tate might bust an implant if shes not careful
MMA,removed,nunez is a total dyke
MMA,removed,httpyougotleakedcommieshatateleakedphotos
MMA,removed,lol

MMA,removed,women suck at fighting
MMA,removed,holly will be back and ko nunes she had no business losing to miehsa the first time this division is a joke
MMA,removed,ok mate literally dont care about your opinion at all you can fuck off now
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,yea im not convinced that shes a woman
MMA,removed,nunes looks like a trans post op
MMA,removed,i dont know where you guys find quality streams all the ones ive seen on kodi or websites were definitely not hd the ones which claimed to be either didnt work or lagged so horribly they were unwatchable i usually torrent the next day so i can watch in hd
MMA,removed,im not underwhelmed i thought it was an excellent card fight pass prelims started the night off with a bang prelims werent as exciting but definitely werent boring main card was pretty fucking crazy dc silva was a little boring but he did what he had to do and i fucking loved the rest fucking casuals
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,he should just start sucking his dick while hes at it
MMA,removed,i wanna bang her
MMA,removed,its alright kid if you want i can pm you an illegal link where the stream doesnt freeze and the quality isnt bad sometimes we even have hd channels
MMA,removed,shoutout to the guy who hosted that kbps stream you da real mvp
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up already literally no one gives a shit about what you think
MMA,removed,bunch of queers
MMA,removed,yeah she would get the willy
MMA,removed,where can i watch the early prelims
MMA,removed,shes about to get monkey fucked by a cyclops with a sword tattoo
MMA,removed,time to eat shit
MMA,removed,remember weeks ago when you affliction wearing idiots were calling hunt via ko in round
MMA,removed,are you fucking stupid or something
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,lose my number sir
MMA,removed,i suggest soft gay porn
MMA,removed,no youre just some loser that wants to puff out his chest over his hindsight get a life ha ha
MMA,removed,oh stop yes they do of the time the ufc makes the right call especially with title fights the person that deserves it the most usually gets it this is another rare exception dont act like its the norm
MMA,removed,hmm bisping got a title shot based off of a shit decision against anderson silva and thats not a disgrace fuck yourself
MMA,removed,lol eat shit
MMA,removed,and what a fine hours that was
MMA,removed,someone tell that leprechaun dick to sit the fuck down
MMA,removed,we are well aware of the difference brock just made a mistake
MMA,removed,but she is the only one that beat the champ
MMA,removed,they can always turn down a title shot cejudo turned down two i believe i know for a fact he did it once before he finally accepted his he felt he wasnt ready so he said no
MMA,removed,brought to you by the makers of gaydarâ¢
MMA,removed,then he shouldnt have accepted the offer its not like he was forced
MMA,removed,ur gay ill fite u
MMA,removed,this is a fact he was ranked everyone bitched that they moved poirier up from to they claimed they did it to make conor look better but its pretty common practice for the people who vote to move people up when they have a fight coming up
MMA,removed,pr translation by our overpriced gay shirts we will give to some gays
MMA,removed,but pena beat her lol
MMA,removed,i want her to stop talking and sit on my face
MMA,removed,no i believe youd be the first customer that actually would want one
MMA,removed,one that isnt ready cejudo turned down two before he accepted one for example i dont think gustaffson should have accepted his title shot against cormier he wasnt mentally ready for that fight he hadnt won in years and he was coming off of two brutal losses if the gus that fought jones fought dc wed have a new champion he looked tentative and had poor fight iq if he was smart and gained his confidence back beating a couple of lower ranked guys he would have finished dc in my mind
MMA,removed,they dont or they are paranoid and think the ufc has them all in their pocket
MMA,removed,id like to see him at bw i dont see him getting another shot at fw he has to wait behind the conor x aldo possibly conor x aldo max holloway and other potential up and comers yair and super boy
MMA,removed,he blinked he has accepted his position as the beta male
MMA,removed,its gotta be mighty mouse and cruz at and dc at
MMA,removed,actually he would probably literally kill you or give you serious brain damage so you wouldnt be able to use the money and technically you would be the stupid fuck
MMA,removed,mighty mouse cruz dc joanna this wont be popular conor aldo lawler stipe bisping rockhold
MMA,removed,youre right about bisping i edited it i think dillashaw belongs as well as wonderboy
MMA,removed,personally i have no issues including jj in a list that includes men mighty mouse cruz dc joanna this wont be popular conor aldo lawler dillashaw stipe wonderboy
MMA,removed,hunt brocks opponent was intelligently responding to the damage by that i mean he was attempting to get brock off of him get up punch back etc the fight is stopped when the person isnt intelligently defending themselves that can include a complete ko unconscious basically kod on their feet still moving but its clear the lights arent on or the fighter turtlingcovering up being completely defenseless and not attempting to fight back like theyre hurt and just covering their face instead of actively attempting to fight hunt wasnt any of those he was conscious aware and intelligently responding
MMA,removed,someone else pointed it out i just cant get behind a list with bisping on it there are a lot of nonchamps in other divisions that deserve to be there before bisping
MMA,removed,as retarded and undeserving as this title shot is i cant wait to listen to the build up bisping is such a fragile champ but he is so entertaining i want it to last forever
MMA,removed,they have a good balance of the time we see the deserving fighter get his shot once in a while we get our fun fights lawlercondit dcgus jonessonnen rockholdbisping now this
MMA,removed,im an ass kisser
MMA,removed,who the fuck watches this shit people need to get a life
MMA,removed,instead of piss yellow they should have just done something more gold httpimgurcomahsxhl
MMA,removed,httpimgurcomxztybup
MMA,removed,dc is gay and proudhe humped silva like he was trying to rape him
MMA,removed,i watched one of the sopcast streams from mmastreams and it was the best quality live stream of anything ive ever watched
MMA,removed,dat ass
MMA,removed,anderson silva knocked out cormier
MMA,removed,so you both have stupid wifes nice
MMA,removed,its just a raw image i slapped together in ai but i thought it worked much better than the yellow octagon they used
MMA,removed,who knows not only was it ugly i just felt it was out of place leading up they used more of a gold to promote not urine yellow so it didnt fit the branding
MMA,removed,thanks buddy like i said i didnt spend more than minutes on it its just something to get the point across
MMA,removed,something about this bromance is endearing like they wanted to hate each other but ended up bffs
MMA,removed,block its actually pretty fitting
MMA,removed,fuck off you wanker
MMA,removed,kindly fuck off you fat fuck
MMA,removed,good for nate everyone at a meet and greet is a retarded fuck
MMA,removed,there is a fight night event on july you fucking casual scum
MMA,removed,would that complete your life is it that important to you what a stupid thing to ask do it yourself pussy
MMA,removed,only gay high school wrestlers would watch it
MMA,removed,mixed martial arts means you can use techniques from a variety of martial arts not that you have to
MMA,removed,would you have the balls to say something aspie
MMA,removed,nothing worse than ufc hipsters i appreciate more obscure technical tactics than you
MMA,removed,youre a goon fuckin bitch
MMA,removed,i think mark could have had a lot more success if he pushed the pace lesnar isnt exactly cruzwonderboy in his evasiveness and i think brocks ability to adhere to his extremely effective gameplan would have come apart under pressure especially of hunt started landing good shots this was my interpretation too specifically hunts lack of initiating exchanges when brock was clearly exhausted in round i think hunt might have a bit of andersons cant lead must counter syndrome to him and it might have hurt him tonight
MMA,removed,this is straight up salty why are you mad play games hes a fucking former champ with wins over legit people fuck off
MMA,removed,shut up
MMA,removed,yeah because its not like they go through hearings and have these supplements tested if youre smelling bull shit its because you havent removed your head from your ass
MMA,removed,just bleed fans worst people fuck off
MMA,removed,i really hope the delusional frankie fans get silenced from this no frankie can not and will not ever beat conor mcgregor or aldo just deal with hes is not as good
MMA,removed,stop use ad hominem fallacy
MMA,removed,okay i was wrong the frankie crowd still think he deserves the title even after getting dominated twice by the guy conor breezed by i was silly to think you would suddenly have any connection with reality
MMA,removed,what a terrible choice
MMA,removed,of course thered be fans of a racist on here
MMA,removed,again flaunting your ignorance i get that fight wasnt enjoyable for you but you sound like a childmaybe you are every time youve aired your opinion in this thread
MMA,removed,i was talking about you you mo mo
MMA,removed,he opened the fight with an attempted head kickwere you not able to see that on your shitty stream or did you just read a play by play
MMA,removed,lol what aldo is gonna rape conor in their rematch
MMA,removed,sodoing a moonsault or a shooting star press isnt athletic how about a handspring elbow its just stupid to say its not athletic to professionally wrestle saying they arent fighters fine not athletic just an idiot remark
MMA,removed,oh go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,gay lovers confirmed
MMA,removed,dont be an idiot so much
MMA,removed,this stupid fat fuck threw punches at lewis and then complained he didnt win fuck him
MMA,removed,my feed froze once on a pay per view they dont give you your money back because you can replay it once after you bought it assholes
MMA,removed,go back to rall casuslfag
MMA,removed,cant stand that fuccboi
MMA,removed,this gets posted once every months for all the nuthuggers to have a wank
MMA,removed,quit being a f and suck that dick
MMA,removed,who else was hoping for north south
MMA,removed,no way gaurantee she wears boxers shes obviously the man of the relationship
MMA,removed,does he have aids not looking too good
MMA,removed,wait what happened
MMA,removed,isnt weidman like
MMA,removed,no fuck off
MMA,removed,im hella curious about this and im not kidding when i ask this since pena is open about her sexuality im wondering if she got a ladyboner while fighting tate and could have changed her hormonal levels that could have actually helped her in the fight i remember there was a study where it said that having sex before a fight would be beneficial for health reasons
MMA,removed,yeah dc proved hes not an entertaining fighter after jbj beats him again his draw is gone he had the perfect opportunity to obtain new fans and future viewers he blew it go back to the olympics to wrestler fuck bitches
MMA,removed,nawww let me guess youre a male feminist
MMA,removed,fair play cowboy fuck pc
MMA,removed,this entire subreddit is full of them just look at any thread about khabib
MMA,removed,the motherfucker looks like a fat baby hippo fuck dc
MMA,removed,so doing a little cocaine out of competition driving fast and drifting turning down a fight on days notice fucks up your career sounds like a pussy mindset imo
MMA,removed,i dont know what youre babbling about are you arguing with your imaginary friends again
MMA,removed,go back to you loser troll
MMA,removed,faggotsaurus rex
MMA,removed,and people wanted dc to stand and trade with him
MMA,removed,bunch of pc faaaags ovaaa here in rmma
MMA,removed,jacare and chris should fight for contendership
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,stfu casual
MMA,removed,i didnt say of the time so you can fuck off
MMA,removed,i guess when it involves lesbians it is always nsfw
MMA,removed,pussies people are grammar nazis too
MMA,removed,im not pc but i also dont throw that word around youre a prime example of why pc culture is a joke though
MMA,removed,hey ufc shills because all of the cool clips have been removed i decided to torrent the event love the quality thanks
MMA,removed,stop saying he gender neutral terms please not being an asshole but you need to be called out on your ignorance
MMA,removed,eat healthy exercise regularly get ample sleep and the world will become much more tolerable fuck you might even start having fun but at the very least you wont be such a little bitch about every little thing
MMA,removed,obviously you are manchild since you obviously have given into the culture of perpetual victimhood and external locus of control that is sooooo trendy right now
MMA,removed,obvious troll is obvious shoo
MMA,removed,good for them as a fighter they can do that myself as a fan can choose to stream their fights instead of giving them any ppv money since they are there for the win and could careless how boring they are watched cormier hold silva up against the cage look and run out the clock for the last of round and the last of round
MMA,removed,he looks so happy like hes thinking even if i just land this then get knocked out thats still better than forrest
MMA,removed,fuck him and fuck kd
MMA,removed,will the rousey skank catch on that would be harsh
MMA,removed,im through talking to you because youre not even addressing anything im saying or answering the question youre talking about other fighters trying to bolster your case im talking about two specific fighters ronda and floyd you have no argument ronda has no tools to close the distance with someone like floyd she couldnt even do it against nunes fuck off already you idiot
MMA,removed,he is an avid and vocal trump supporter odds of him being progressive or open minded about gay issues are not super high
MMA,removed,dude can you imagine a cocaine party with overeem jones cerrone dodson and kennedy thatd be incredible
MMA,removed,politely rebuffed by idiots everyone that knows anything knows ronda should not have tried to box this woman but not the dipshits here
MMA,removed,another one with animation of edmond lol
MMA,removed,she can triangle choke the fuck outta me id just bury my face deeper
MMA,removed,beg me
MMA,removed,jan at utc happy new year everyone this is the first dance of i want to see who can do the best rousey skank post your videos and hashtag dotherousey newdance happynewyear turntup thebesthandsdown handsdown httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,removed,he could have easily promoted the first openly gay what the fuck does that matter hey everyone come watch this dyke fight
MMA,removed,see my telent
MMA,removed,its directly from his asshole
MMA,removed,this wont add to the discussion but i want you to have it fuck you
MMA,removed,how many times did ronda face gets pop
MMA,removed,youre a fucking dipshit dude
MMA,removed,the most important person who thought dana was right was amanda nunes cause she agreed to the money every other maggle can stfu
MMA,removed,yeah piss you sore loser learn to act like an adult instead of a sulking year old little bitch
MMA,removed,you should pull your head out and look at things objectively youll be much less surprised by things and do a lot better at life in general if youre surprised youre not paying attention to the world around you or asking the right questions
MMA,removed,dickhead troll harder yeah
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,can i please get an answer from a person who doesnt suffer from autism
MMA,removed,ronda was coming off a loss was no longer champ and her name was no longer plastered everywhere i think she and nunes should have gotten more similar payments conor and mendes both got for their fight but it was mostly conor that people wanted to see fight maybe ronda still should have gotten paid more but more like more than nunes not times more i know its a business but its also a sport and decisions made now affect its ability to be a recognized viable sport and league down the line paying your rich white blond challenger what youre paying your poor brown gay brazilian champion is just ridiculous especially based on these facts
MMA,removed,you are your own personal dickhead too
MMA,removed,for some people the would not be worth the humiliation yeah maybe for bill gates but for most people even ronda who isnt as rich as you think she is is a shitload of money think of it this way a doctor making would have to work years to earn the value of m today note i factored in inflation ronda made in a minute what a doctor making would have to work fucking years to make minute of fucking around years worth of doctors work
MMA,removed,probably eats mad pussy
MMA,removed,autism
MMA,removed,complete clowns no coincidence the worst guy jumped on the basic bitch fad of shitty tattoos and beard
MMA,removed,hes armenian
MMA,removed,tha clit cock
MMA,removed,megan olivi nudes
MMA,removed,she looks like a damn gorilla shes got quite the deep voice as well must but something in that rizin water
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,completely different and fucking stupid comparison
MMA,removed,the knob squad
MMA,removed,i dont give a fuck about her im explain to a bunch of furious douchebags whats going on
MMA,removed,jazzy gabi kandori you gotta marry kill and fuck one whats your picks
MMA,removed,hes armenian do we have to spell it out for you certain cultures treat women like trash and he is from one of them
MMA,removed,pizzagate is real though incidentally its not a joke
MMA,removed,kind of dickish and condescending to assume im not creative or imaginative just because i dont see a deeper meaning in two pictures of ronda rouseys back
MMA,removed,why does everyone have a stick up their ass about neck tattoos shut the fuck up and grow up he has tattoos everywhere and no i wouldnt get the same tattoos but the guy looks good
MMA,removed,yes obviously no actually you just sound like a pretentious asscock like many people who discuss art im glad that youre so in tune with your inner perception you see the problem was that i wasnt viewing the photo from my minds eye
MMA,removed,if that were the case half the people i know would be spending decades in prison shut the fuck up you social justice pussy it isnt right to punish people for extremely long periods of time for committing mildmoderate crimes many developed countries even have maximum prison sentences of years which means if you killed people your prison sentence cant be more than years the united states imprisons more people than many other countries
MMA,removed,how is it difficult to understand that ronda has achieved more in the sport and is a way bigger name that nunes despite who currently holds the belt thats why theres more articles dummy
MMA,removed,if he was fucking a child then yes some of us go out of our way to catch a predator sorry for interrupting you favourite sex criminals party time you stupid idiot
MMA,removed,soooooo has ronda killed herself yet
MMA,removed,itÂ´s from that time when i was originalyl with your mum shit is bomb son
MMA,removed,kinda like i tried so hard not to cum inside your mom shit is bomb son
MMA,removed,kinda like i fights inside your mom shit is bomb son
MMA,removed,kinda like i performance inside your mom shit is bomb son
MMA,removed,kinda like i cant contribute inside your mom shit is bomb son
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°
MMA,removed,kinda like i get it inside your mom shit is bomb son
MMA,removed,haha found the armenian yan
MMA,removed,i feel like edmond was a typical armenian who opened up a cash business to launder money but he accidentally landed ronda rousey as a client and was forced to become an mma trainer to protect his identity
MMA,removed,lol oh please most of this is just mma theatre call me when shes drunk driving and hits a pregnant woman with her car and then maybe calling her the biggest ass in the sport is justified it seems like she has to fight angry always be in the zone and being friendly with people messes up that concentration
MMA,removed,jesus shut up dude are you
MMA,removed,well for what its worth i could never get into jacking off when this little shit was in a scene danny d is on the same track
MMA,removed,could this worthless little rapist please just die of aids already
MMA,removed,im the one who needs to get out more kindly fuck off with that shit youre right poor white people so incredibly oppressed

MMA,removed,are you dumb or something he had the chance to get his ts now that hes already trained and in shape and given his age if he keeps delaying it theres a big chance of this never happening his knee issue is probably some pr stunt to justify the reason why he isnt taking this fight it didnt bother him on his fight last saturday now he will be years old when if he fights for the belt cause he will have to fight either weidman or romero first
MMA,removed,not that dipshit im saying the reign as a whole its not about conors moment its about years of the same dude on top at least silva put flair on his reign with captivating fights

MMA,removed,shut up asshole its a song
MMA,removed,cerrone was still the last one to beat alvarez cerrone was also on a fight win streak before the rda fight okay but he still doesnt deserve a title shot imo for the reasons i already stated im pretty sure im in the majority for that as well that someone like ferguson deserves it a ton more my initial point was saying the khabib and cerrone situations and claims for title shots are very different like somebody claimed getting destroyed in your last fight in that division is a bit of a different situation than being undefeated i bet you also think jose aldo is trash now too after the mcgregor fight and doesnt deserve another chance fuck off just a stupid thing to say
MMA,removed,actually im the one who gave my opinion and he was making into a pointless ass argument dont reply again child
MMA,removed,thats because all the pothead losers now have something to chirp about from their parents basements

MMA,removed,you cunts will make any excuse for the diaz brothers
MMA,removed,for all we know this could be majorly fucking with mcgregors head but thats just it you dont know youre all biased psychological analysts as soon as mcgregor reacts to anything you dont know what is going on in his head so shut the fuck up about it
MMA,removed,i dont have a problem with it dipshit it becomes a problem when you apologise for someone who is detrimental not only to himself but the sport too when you support a fucking thug and think youre justified in abusing others because of it in the words of mcgregor get the fuck outta here
MMA,removed,are you staying kimo isnt world class gtfo
MMA,removed,they are a constant embarrassment to the sport a sport where people fight each other in a cage lmao fuck off your high horse
MMA,removed,so by your logic being a prostitute is a good example for kids as long as you dont do butt stuff are you slow
MMA,removed,how about you watch the video first or stfu
MMA,removed,he got hurt last time but he hid it well if youve even bothered to use your brain you could just as easily realise that a similar thing is going to happen this time around only to a more efficient degree
MMA,removed,nobody said he was losing the mental war with chad and nobody said he was losing it with aldo people said aldo won one single staredown thats it there was some ooh he clowned mcgregor with that pose stealing and then conor got a little mad but conor was winning the mental war against both for months just like diaz has been he also didnt have an injured knee in the mendes fight he had an injured knee in the fucking camp before the fight my god conor fans are so stupid
MMA,removed,absolutely hilarious how conor fans have switched from conor is in his head conor is a mental warfare expert nobody does it like him to well it doesent really matter its just words you are all a hilarious conor fans trump fans
MMA,removed,posts for the entire year of conor is in his head conor is a mental warfare master conor won the fight before they even stepped in the cage posts after nate tools mcgregor twice before their fights it doesent matter u even have a psychology degree
MMA,removed,fuck it those prices are so retarded im gonna illegally stream this shit
MMA,removed,typical stream or nothing then i guess
MMA,removed,i think the risk isnt the message itself which is pretty unimportant in the grande scheme of things but rather that having her fb screenname made public may open it up to people stalking her and harassing her her friends or her family just with a quick glance i am seeing images of her with her family in private get togethers or at home pictures of her with some kids old family pictures as well as her friends list which as i mentioned before includes members of her family if i can see this then so can crazy stalkers and neckbeard trolls too i wouldnt go as far as to say this is doxxing but it definitely isnt cool i think

MMA,removed,pics or gtfo
MMA,removed,im in full support of bonuses to healthcare guaranteed fighter income pensions minimum payments relative to gates etc what i am not in favour of allowing fighters out of their organisations contract fighters having mandated input into their opponents here is a bit of an explanation of the last comment im a huge boxing fan i love the sport but frankly its really really shitty right now its great if you are a great fighter you get paid insane amounts for beating up cans and then only taking a few risky fights in your entire career also im a boxing fan and i sometimes miss ppvs shows and results why because promoters are terrible no central organisation means you can have insanely good fights promoted by dipshits or insanely shit fights promoted by eddie hearn mma fighters like to talk the any person any time i just wanna fight game but look at the reality tyrone woodley avoids fighting for months then immediately starts talking about the money fights well who dictates that does woodley have a right to say or does woodley fight who earns a shot at the title mma orgs can still do this mvp in bellator they are sending him out against guys who cant stand against him letting fighters control their fights is dangerous too do you want to be a lower end guy in the ufc if you know that you are going to have to fight the world champion is that right should they be allowed to endanger their lives
MMA,removed,im a work in progress bot
MMA,removed,im rooting for him this weekend hes not my favorite fighter or anything and i certainly dont think he does no wrong unlike you with your love for conor if conor doesnt care about the belt he should be rightfully stripped calling aldo a coward makes you a legitimate down syndrome patient and there is no reason to continue talking to you its impossible to hear you with conors dick this deep down your throat
MMA,removed,hard thing to lose a child it can be like night and day everyone is happy and excited then she blames you and you blame her fighting all the time fuck you whore couldnt even have a child from your rancid womb you leave and she starts cutting herself and i pick up a bottle of vodka and driving in the traffic and the bottle is at my lips and i see two guys looking at me who i used to see in aa i dont pray anymore but my hope is with the sonnen family

MMA,removed,why the fuck are people commenting rip the guy was a fucking murderer fuck him
MMA,removed,great contribution fuckstick
MMA,removed,people nonstop shitting on conor and danis and jerking off nate in this thread its amazing how nate is the apparent goat in every aspect of mma all of a sudden to these people who never said a word about him not months
MMA,removed,if he wanted to stop the sweep he would have been doing something to stop it right how can you be this retarded if that was possible in every situation people wouldnt get swept he wasnt able to do anything to stop it it happened to fast and unexpectedly its not a common mma sweep thats the conclusion you should be coming to
MMA,removed,what you said is retarded you admit that nate wasnt able to do anything to stop the sweep yet you came to the conclusion that that was because he decided he wanted to be on his back getting punched in the face thats bonkers and the reason you think that is because your love of nate has made you delusional and unable to comprehend reality nate got swept because mcgregor did it to fast and out of nowhere nate didnt realise what was happening until it was too late i have trained primarily in judo but whats funnier is that youre disagreeing with a bjj black belt all over this thread thats how delusional your bizarre love of nate has made you nate himself could say mcgregor got the sweep and youd say he was just being humble
MMA,removed,and then gets punched in the face a few times you new nate nuthuggers are so delusional its insane control from his back is that what you call being pushed into the foetal position against the cage and punched
MMA,removed,im glad you can admit that youre dumb i notice youve been curiously silent about your own grappling credentials and i presume its because youre a fat neckbeard loser whose only concept of exercise is when your parents make you walk to the bathroom to piss in the toilet instead of a bucket in your room i looked in your post history to see if you ever posted on rbjj and instead discovered you genuinely do have a weird obsession with nate and a pathetic hatred of mcgregor and the irish in general go fuck yourself twat
MMA,removed,he comes back to rape and torture but he has good jits
MMA,removed,dick riding is strong in this subreddit please refrain from supporting the legitimate winner of the fight and stand for the loud mouthed piece of junk who calls himself the best fighter on the planet yet proceeds to get his ass handed to him by a dude who had days to train backs out of a rematch due to media obligations aka peds cycle aka fleeing from usada is easier when youre in iceland and not to mention hes a below average mma fighter peace
MMA,removed,the only thing i hate more than joanna jedlzozjzjzidfuck is the people who support her worst human being alive

MMA,removed,hey dipshitmma wrestling and actual wrestling are completely different things the distance stance weight distribution and timing are completely different how well did his second to none takedowns work against cain hunt has higher takedown defense than lesnar either hunt knocks him out or lesnar loses a decision you are retarded if u think brock is going to finish hunt in round
MMA,removed,oh shut the hell up man youre just arguing just yo argue if you cant see the difference between an ncaa champion in his prime and a glorified actor pushing then youre just an idiot besides brock did have a good chance of losing thats why he didnt start in the ufc and had to prove himself and he did prove himself lot of people were surprised with his skill punk is almost certainly not good enough to win against anybody in the top tier leagues thats why hes getting a cherry picked nobody to fight against
MMA,removed,bing bong
MMA,removed,when i was wed form a ring out of chairs in the corner of a classroom and force un athletic kids to box each other for entertainment

MMA,removed,stop throwing cans billy
MMA,removed,danas woodly
MMA,removed,everyone gets what they deserve this is so naive its laughable lets say alvarez starts talking all sorts of shit about the ufc calling for a fighters union etc you dont think the ufc would punish him by relegating him to fight pass cards from here on out you dont think fighters often take fights that they could have gotten more for because they need the money you dont think that the ufc with its market share doesnt abuse its power in some circumstances to its own advantage it must be nice to live in fantasy land
MMA,removed,because i havent come across you yet so you can say that to my face bitch i know you wont youre a pussy
MMA,removed,you have to remember reddit is super white and full of altright neonazi cunts
MMA,removed,fuck you you dont exist
MMA,removed,pss youre a delusional asshole of a person ð
MMA,removed,while that all sounds good what youre forgetting is that aldo and edgar had every right to turn down a short notice nontitle fight at a division above their fighting weight this cannot be held against them and now enough time has been spent on adventures outside his championship division that conor through unforseen circumstances has missed the opportunity and has to defend his belt hes holding up the division and has already cause there to be an interim belt despite still being active
MMA,removed,i i understand but its an interesting yet flawed theory imo conor was already paid what he was owed at he was obsessed with avenging that loss to nate that he refused to defend the belt and pulled from arguably conor pulling from was more egregious than any fight also has pulled out of as i see it conor is no longer owed anything he made the company lots of money and in return has already gotten many special favours that other fighters including aldos repeated requests to fight at were denied

MMA,removed,you little twerp
MMA,removed,i get your idea and think its cool but you gotta factor in a few things like the venue accommodations technology investment for streaming staff to work insurance keeping lawyers on retainer for when dana sues keeping doctors on payroll for after the fights and prefight testing etc while the ufc makes a ton of money there is a lot of overhead associated that is typically lost

MMA,removed,anybody know if there is any way to watch the prelims without fight pass
MMA,removed,i dont think one internet guy hurt that his selfentitled needs arent met arent gonna change how rmma works you have the free will not to click on a thread nobody has you at gunpoint by your logic we shouldnt have any gifs of conor koing eddie because that was essentially showcasing boxing or maia choking out condit because that was essentially showcasing bjj fuck off being a selfentitled child
MMA,removed,sorry you cant express yourself without people being assholes
MMA,removed,anyone know a free stream for prelims
MMA,removed,there have been some great fights this year ie leo santa cruzcarl frampton miurasalido thurmanporter etc not saying there hasnt been some absolute shitshows and mismatches but there is reason to be optimistic

MMA,removed,fuck stewart he said fuck him
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,were all sitting here patiently waiting for tyron to outline the racism he has suffered claims made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence
MMA,removed,the other potential main events is irrelevant she was the main event not sure why you even brought that up ufc was all about rousey because her star power is literally the amount of nunes it would be stupid and bad business for the ufc to not market rousey as much as possible for that fight and guess what ufc did well and nunes probably took home a lot of cash if nunes was the main attraction nobody would have given a fuck about that fight
MMA,removed,who gives a fuck if there wasnt any promotion her name is literally on two of the biggest ppvs in recent history
MMA,removed,he gassed early

MMA,removed,hope youre enjoying this utragically english
MMA,removed,floyd and ali were super polarizing and both drew visceral emotional reactions from boxing fans around the world some saw them as low lives and other saw them as the second coming i think its understood that that played into why they were able to draw so well outside of those two there really hasnt been a combat sports superstar aside from sugar ray robinson but he was more short lived a product of olympic hype nationalism and he eventually ended up sharing that emotional connection and attention with the rest of the horsemen duran hagler and hearns there is definitely a race thing there with combat sports i think it should be obvious when you see how deep nationalism plays into combat sports however its really hard to express how race plays into it without being accused of being a racebaiter or whatever
MMA,removed,wheres resident woodley nuthugger uwovagrovaflame to tell us all how much of a great guy woodley is and is not a racist at all
MMA,removed,itt white people telling black people how to feel about their own experiences
MMA,removed,cody no love mike perry conor fucking mcgregor those are some explosive whities and thats what people describe them as the explosive argument just makes it obvious that some people are so sensitive that theyll call anything racist
MMA,removed,you can tell theres mostly white people in these comments due to people dismissing the issues and racial undertones because they personally never experienced it therefore it doesnt exist
MMA,removed,are you white then not talking about race benifits you because you have the privledge to not care about it for people of color race is a daily part of life that affects every interaction
MMA,removed,he doesnt speak that well lolprobably the least articulate of the front desk analysts
MMA,removed,wishful thinking even if he wins itll almost certainly be by pitter pattering to a decision
MMA,removed,eh shes still hot she can leave mma behind

MMA,removed,maybe for your birthday edmond will get you some head mooooveeement
MMA,removed,we got white people was the early angle of the zuffa era but many feel any criticism of the ufc is criticism of them for liking the ufc
MMA,removed,fucking pieces of shit go jake
MMA,removed,whos a nazi the gay jew lol nice jake
MMA,removed,the tolerant left people
MMA,removed,he literally wouldnt name a single example when ariel politely asked him to give some kind of specifics as to why he feels race is a major part of his lack of likeability that alone says to me hes just trying to make headlines
MMA,removed,you find it weird that people are bothered by race baiting and victim complexes im sure that woodley has gotten been called racial slurs by ufc fans over social media a few times thats nothing special most ufc fighters have probably experienced something like that including white nonamerican fighters this sport attracts a lot of dumb middle school boys trying to be edgy the overwhelming majority of mma fans root for fighters they like regardless of race its a complete nonissue
MMA,removed,post them then or stfu
MMA,removed,the fact of the matter is that black dudes have to be objectively better than everyone else to get any respect what world do you live in
MMA,removed,no matter how much you want to like woodley you just cant because hes a whiny bitch
MMA,removed,not a great movie you shut your goddamn mouth

MMA,removed,which is nearly exactly what the crybaby brigade dresses like kind of weird
MMA,removed,this is the truth of whats going on if your not liberal progressive your either racist sexist ignorant altright or ofcourse nazi
MMA,removed,man fuck these extreme liberal pussies no wonder trump won they seemed to be scared of jake lol maybe they recognized him
MMA,removed,imagine youre an antifascist beating the shit out of some poor trump supporter and jake mother fucking shields shows up to wreck your shit they didnt even know who he was boy they had another thing coming
MMA,removed,its because cody is white tyrone woodley
MMA,removed,so who are the idiots with the bats and masks milo yiannopoulos trump supporters i assume

MMA,removed,the olympics is slowly transitioning from amateur to professional again in most sports historically the olympics were meant for the best of the best with winners receiving land vineyards and olive groves ancient olympics that is the concept of the olympics being for amateurs is only a recent one now they are transitioning back looking forwards i think you will find more and more so that olympic events will shift from pointless traditional amateur stuff sync swimming diving artistic gymnastics tramampolining to professional sports theres just too much commercial gain in having pro sports and competitors at the olympics compared to unknowns competing every years in sports that mostly nontelevised and people couldnt care less about

MMA,removed,why did he fuck your mother or your gf maybe what warrants such hate towards him
MMA,removed,dude youre opinion is still retarded if youre opinion is that jon is chairing which is a quality that literally anyone can have then why the fuck did you even bother typing and posting your comment
MMA,removed,i hope they knock each other out fucking fucke this fight shouldnt even be happening
MMA,removed,just ice it pussy
MMA,removed,do you pretty much have to buy ppv to see really good fights or are there other options in order of preference find a few friends to split a ppv with its a good time bullshitting with them and taking bets just for fun monetary or drinking go to a bar this is actually pretty hard in my area very few actually run ufc ppvs although buffalo wild wings always does but it gets really crowded on a fight night so not as preferable imo find an illegal stream im sure people get better at this but for me its a huge hassle to find one that works let alone has decent quality and you should pay for what youre supposed to etc and as a fairly new subscriber to fightpass i would highly recommend it take the free trial then maybe sub for a month maybe cancel for a bit and come back to it or you can get the reduced rate for longer commitments obviously theres some great fights and i enjoy watching the ultimate fighter especially older seasons where you see people that are great now be a nobody back then
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,lmao entitled much fuck off meathead no one gives a shit about your opinion
MMA,removed,tldr diaz fan doesnt want to admit that other factors mayve been involved in conor losing yawn
MMA,removed,no conor decided to not show up for his media obligations the fight is happening in days either way idk if you know that plus that doesnt answer the dos anjos fight nor why they let him fight at again dummy
MMA,removed,ecks dee
MMA,removed,well you obviously didnt read the rest of my post sure its a bit shit that you cant buy the ppv and thats it you need bt sport but were pretty lucky that bt have the deal and not sky because wed have to purchase a sky subppv cost
MMA,removed,douchebag comment from a douchebag with a douchebag username
MMA,removed,been hours let me get home in hours and ill make it as long as someone isnt quicker than me
MMA,removed,upvote this is a great example of top level coaching and strategy henri hooft and the blackzillians team noticed that allstars training center gym had a bad habit of throwing lazy front kicks and this was highlighted by guss training partner niklas bÃ¤ckstrÃ¶m getting blasted with an overhand right while spamming them against mike wilkinson months prior hooft heard this and called it out to johnson who did the exact same counter smashed gus with a right and possibly an unintentional head butt almost right after regardless it led to the ko
MMA,removed,u think i need a supid fuckwitt like u telling me to look good on the rowing machine
MMA,removed,holy shit you are very stupid read your post then come back here and write some more stupid shit about how your post was not about weed once again your talking about something that is as regular as the sun coming up and explaining it away as i am rude or any other lame female excuse shows how fucking stupid you are you spending your life watching nick diaz snapchat then posting uninformed posts on reddit then trying to explain away being stupid with a bunch of stupid excuses turn off the internet shut the fuck up because you are stupid and try to read a book you god damn moron
MMA,removed,you sound like a little bitch if you think that the above is acceptable behaviour from anyone reading your comment history this looks to be a fact good day mlady x
MMA,removed,yes i saw it he was not agressive but that doesnt mean you can assume he was scared gsp is not the aggressor many times but do any of us say he was scared find me anyone else in this sub that thinks silva was scared i want to see diaz fights but you dont need his nuts in your mouth to justify his losses
MMA,removed,downvoted for the truth fuck your facts bitch
MMA,removed,thats so stupid you literally just referred to your own phone as nightmarish while my piece of garbage works perfectly fine do you understand how stupid you sound
MMA,removed,oh the conor shills got some comment upvoted that is incredibly stupid honestly are conor fans only people with an extra chromosome i know conor kinda has the face of a downie but still what does he do that attracts all these retards
MMA,removed,i really hope that at the end of each of her vlogs she should show pat doing something embarrassing like taking a shit or something
MMA,removed,does pat enjoy the buzz or do you wear wigs in bed
MMA,removed,when do you poop asking for a friend
MMA,removed,would you touch a poop for
MMA,removed,if kowalkiewicz gets the title shot and wins against joanna will you ask for a rematch against kowalkiewicz or would you want to take a crack at joanna first and then go for title
MMA,removed,lelkek are you
MMA,removed,sorry brittany i may have been in a dickish mood when i replied beforehand rory was on the podcast saying this was true but here you are saying its debunked with no evidence to back it up put in the effort to prove your point or kindly fuck off
MMA,removed,does your fist fit in your asshole
MMA,removed,ok piss flap keep dreaming
MMA,removed,he should be cut for his last fight he does a poor job how about touching on any of my points dickhead
MMA,removed,how exactly am i being an asshole so many people keep acting like im calling them stupid acting like im saying im special and acting like im suggesting im better than the reddit community that im a part of just because i said reddit is reddit god forbid anyone say something actually offensive cause the people offended by me saying reddit is reddit are fragile as fuck it wasnt as insult it wasnt an implication that everyone sucks but me and it certainly wasnt of malicious intent it was simply a statement of reddit cant be chael sonnen cause reddit is a conglomerate of several individuals that share enough differences that theres no other way to define reddit other than of itself reddit is reddit remind me that the next time i leave a statement up for interpretation that several people are going to assume the most negative interpretation possible just because they want to be upset absolutely ridiculous
MMA,removed,biggest piece of shit not even that nazi guy and that one asian dude that gangraped some woman jon is a fuck up but honestly he seems to have done more damage to himself than any other innocent human being
MMA,removed,saying in mma history means it includes fighters from all time periods but that does not automatically determine criteria for judging who is a top welterweight also you can take that serious fan label and shove it up your ass i wrestle i kickbox i do jiu jitsu and i havent missed a single ufc event in years just because you dont agree with the list doesnt make me an amateur fan
MMA,removed,dat ass tho
MMA,removed,i guess if you are balls deep in the boyish orange is the new black type of chick
MMA,removed,no wonder so many people get shot in america he pulls a gun on someone and you lot defend him
MMA,removed,yeah his circumstances are maybe a little difference if he has had legitimate threats just not sure there are that many isis boots on the ground in the usa mind its more the attitude of anyone on my property would get the same that ive read
MMA,removed,iaxd babez if he likes me n he sai noe so i diedden he say i you
MMA,removed,just that you should shut the fuck up is all diaper baby
MMA,removed,damn i have had a blast reading your comments in this thread youre so delusional and you dont even know it
MMA,removed,quit acting like pa isnt full of ignorant redneck trash
MMA,removed,i mean he pretty clearly does tag him right on the jaw in this gif but conor is moving away from the punch so he doesent get hit with too much force
MMA,removed,no the top level guys pay a or a set amount to training partners gym camp crew nutritionist etc so the number would have to overcome what theyre getting paid now if conor makes mil per fight flat then just getting would be an instant the crew that back the biggest fighters would instead encourage them to not join there is no way a group bargaining deal would pay everyone in camp partners every fighter etc usd annually especially with the amount of money the ufc is generating in its current state partner hey conor why dont you join the union conor how about you shut the fuck up and hold mits for partner sounds good
MMA,removed,youre opinion is retarded and not warranted
MMA,removed,you obviously dont understand english if you read my comment you would see that i covered all components that make up size height reach weight nate diaz would have above average height reach as a ww he would have an average weight cut as a ww nate diaz is an averaged sized ww fighting at lw deal with it
MMA,removed,what a fucking aspie

MMA,removed,then you take the inverse of what if some asshole like gets in my way and keeps asking me a weird question not even saying this guy is an asshole but its in the eye of the beholder from one persons perspective this guy is literally recording me and asking me a random question also sorta getting in my way

MMA,removed,it would be great if there was a reliable ranking system and next in line gets the shot thats pretty much how it works if you keep winning fights you will eventually get a shot theres no reason for all these aspies complaining about money fights its good for sport and more entertaining
MMA,removed,you sound like an isis sympathizer correct that or fuck yourself
MMA,removed,lol douche
MMA,removed,i gave him an explanation instead of downvoting you new here motherfucker
MMA,removed,ah fanboys still ridin that gsp dick gsp needs to come back and get fedord so people move the fuck on
MMA,removed,the pass is referring to the critique hes receiving for his performance from whom i dont care if you dont agree about dc receiving the criticism and i dont give a shit we werent talking about whether or not i agree we were talking about whether or not your opinion actually matters enough to give the champion a pass it doesnt but he was denied that pass by whom the only people that really matter gave him a pass you do know that he won right dont act like you dont understand what im referring to i actually dont youre not really making any sense he did what he had to do against one of the most dangerous strikers ive ever seen you do what you have to do to win only a fucking idiot would risk their health or career to do otherwise and dont get it twisted im a on and off wrestling coach and love wrestling but i dislike when a wrestler carpets a guy in a mma fight im not twisting shit your credentials are irrelevant he won that fight and he won it fairly that is the fact of the matter and the way people like yourself feel about it is completely irrelevant especially when you consider how poorly thought out most of the arguments are
MMA,removed,you didnt have fatherson masturbation days jeez that was a time honored tradition when i was young
MMA,removed,crying lol
MMA,removed,stream it then
MMA,removed,nah he gets tagged clean and theres no debate about it youre all crazy people its been like hours and im still salty as fuck about that thread youre crazy
MMA,removed,actually its not that great well it can be if you prepare properly with great diet setting cover interior of sex place in plastic but this is not often the case as the lust for diarrhea fucking often comes spontaneous and unexpected
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,watch your legs joe
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,race issue shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,a host of moving violations wtf is that and you meanthe dui he didnt serve any jail time for i do not agree that you can say based off that one incident or a previous dui in that he recklessly endangers others nobody said he was the best role model in the world your comments about his personality and character are way out of line imo apparently everybody here hates jon jones now so ill take the downvotes but i think its bullshit how people attack his character in that moment of pressure it grinds my gears
MMA,removed,gonna let trump babysit you tween daughter
MMA,removed,way to try and put words in my mouth at no point did i mention anything about responsibility i was implying you cant speak to the thought process behind his decisions you dont know him or much about his life dropping rocks off an overpass seriously dumbest fucking argument ever what goal what gain is there in doing that you would never do that without the intent to hurt someone come the fuck off your high horse its clear youre butthurt because someone you know has been affected by driving under the influence which he wasnt proven to be btw
MMA,removed,as someone living in abq this was hilarious to watch i work at a bar that jones frequents so ive seen a lot my coworkers and i have all seen him cheating on his wife the last time being less than a month ago he gave a couple of my coworkers weed and cocaine about a month and a half ago its so weird having seen all of this with my own eyes and then watching how he acts in this interview jon jones has no soul lol
MMA,removed,you were clearly raised around it so its normalized behaviour for you most people and society at large see a dui as a serious thing one dui is considered very bad and can easily ruin your life depending on your profession eight duis is insanity not trying to be a dick here but you have a maladjusted view on the gravity of a dui
MMA,removed,it was between rounds you stupid fuck
MMA,removed,you can also use the code word rogan that is rogan save yourself off the fleshlight
MMA,removed,you have to be a troll no one is this stupid
MMA,removed,leprechaun
MMA,removed,im reinforcing shitty famousperson behavior the ufc is a goddamn business you troglodyte the only way they grow and the only way even the lowest guy on the totem gets better pay is based entirely on famous people you know like every major sport now cry about being called names and talked mean to
MMA,removed,lol shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,who you are kallebo shut your ass up
MMA,removed,you apparently have a great grasp of logic considering none of your above posts have any whatsoever
MMA,removed,he knows mm would fuck him and his betamale existence into the ground hes got that littlejournalist syndrome
MMA,removed,this is number one bullshit
MMA,removed,u misconstrued what i actually said next time read the actual comment its short too
MMA,removed,youre actually an idiot i dont think you understand that mayweather is around stronger than rose as well as having some of the quickest hands in the world some of the best footwork in the world as well as an incredible reaction time he would also knock her clean out in punch considering he punches astronomically harder anyone who rose has fought it would be incredibly dangerous for rose to fight mayweather and would likely end up receiving serious long lasting damage also if rose was buttscooting she becomes a practically immobile target for one of the most accurate punchers in the history of boxing although it would be better than trying to fight standing up she would still have chance of winning
MMA,removed,are you expecting conor fanboys to have any knowledge on athletes from different sports
MMA,removed,

MMA,removed,and you must be an idiot because youre so wrong
MMA,removed,these are the words of vince gilligan youre being directed by the words of a vince gilligan interview im giving evidence in the show breaking bad by vince gilligan as am i the literal words of the creator himself are a pretty fucking good supplement to that though i have a feeling he might have an idea of what hes talking about and most adults agree that meth should be illegal either way walts crime was cooking meth because its illegal which is by your explanation defensible because the law is morally questionable which should in turn apply to the people addicted to meth his plans failed all the fucking time he constantly had to kill threaten and manipulate to accomplish his goals not only did his plans not fail ending up happy with skyler and his family in episode with million but walt never took sauls advice to leave skyler or murder hank and he never took skylers advice to murder jesse nor did he escape to an exotic location with his millionsmaking a new life surrounded by young attractive women and this was his downfall to the very last scene walter sacrificed his own life to provide for his children avenge his brotherinlaw hank and rescue his friend jesse so because he occasionally made a morally upright decision it erases all of the awful things hes done youre conveniently ignoring all of the times he willingly participated in the meth trade ive given you a shit ton of answers already all you do is name characters name someone innocent and then claim what walt did to them directly in breaking bad not some crazy butterfly effect that youre imagining because you read walt is a bad guy in some magazine holy fuck dude its not some crazy butterfly effect these arent spirals of tangential relationships that disconnect walt from the people whose lives hes ruined all of this shit all of these people would have been infinitely better off if walt just died of his cancer none of them would have been dragged into a hell of walts making had he not foisted it upon them i didnt read about this in a magazine you childish prick stop with this absurd condescension its quite possibly the least warranted ive ever seen in my life i came to these conclusions on my own long before discussing this or reading about it with anyone but my friends and in little detail even then youre still falling into the narrative trap the creator himself said he set up and you have the fucking gall to call me biased clearly theres nothing more to be said here you simply refuse to acknowledge this characters complicity in his own world you act like things are just happening to him and that some external force pushed him into it frankly it speaks to your character that you cant see that
MMA,removed,go back to school please
MMA,removed,i wish i could down vote you again
MMA,removed,the shit you people come out with aldo will never ever get another shot at conor and rightfully so the reason people think aldo was treated so poorly by the ufc is because on a professional level as a pure business aldo has zero respect he fucked conor over the promotion over thousands of fans over when he didnt show up to and all you cum guzzlers will be on here saying he had a bruised rib or whatever the president of the ufc was saying he was full of shit he was checked out and is fine the promotion was furious with him who knows better a dude sitting in his cum stained boxers after watching diaz v mcgregor i or the dude who paid the doctors to check him out got the results and publically stated them that was the day he burned his bridges after pulling out of or title fights previosly he had about a show up rate imagine mcgregor didnt show up to one title fightnever mind half of them aldo is also a juicer there is zero reasonable explanation for why piss was being spilled the gym lost its shit when he was tested they got cops involved the crooked as shit brazilian authorities again the ufc stepped in asking what the fuck was going on dana going only as far as saying the testing procedure was completely normal it was aldo and his gyms reaction that was completely abmornal he left very very thinly unsaid between the lines stuff then after fucking over the ufc a few times but he was a champ so what but the major fuck over of aldo had a chance to redeem himself ufc after aldo tweeted any time any place prior to the event rda pulls the only fight that could maintain the hype and keep the ppv sales up was aldo so the ufc turned to him and he turns down the fight so he ran from the biggest fight and ruined the biggest fight the first time then refused to show up and save the biggest fight the second time this is why dana the ufc and conor dont respect aldo and dont want to deal with him conor should be made defend his beltyou think theyre going to ever trust aldo to show up to a conor card aldo on a conor card and a nyc card he will never be trusted with a big main event again and every conor card is a big main event even the whole thing of fighting nate outside the division twice really only time counts as aldo was offered the first fight and his refusal was in part how the second fight came about outside the division by conor losing there was always the risk of a rematch if that happened from aldos pov and conor holding up belts he has more fucking ufc fights than aldo every single scheduled fight since mendes has been a title fight with the exception of diaz ii mcgregor has never pulled from a fight or not shown up he has offered to come in on short notice several times for fights even ufc he offered to come in when they lost their headliner and when there wasnt even a specific oppoenent or weight class that is the kind of guy who gets respect in the fight game the type of guy who earns a fight outside his division instead of defending a belt the type of guy who is a real champion aldo is a fucking juiced up pussy bum who hides under the octagon fuck aldo even when he did show up he let every down by getting smoked in seconds hes a bitch and hell never ever get another shot

MMA,removed,look i get it you hate cyborg maybe she did something to you personally and now you are against her like i said im a mma fan and i know better all the woman at walk around heavier than if this was strike force most those woman would compete at and you do give a fuck what she looks like if she was a pretty lady youll be up her ass arguing the opposite like i said im a mma fan so yes i want to see the best female fighter in the world fight and on a regular bases until shit calls it quits you ufc dana fanboys who suck up to anything piece of bullshit dana puts out there are some of the worst fans in all off sports and ever my only hope is rizin takes over the mma world because you guys suck with your little holier than thou opinions
MMA,removed,it should be an even playing field if he gets fights that he doesnt deserve merited only by the fact that he is drawing in more ppvs than it lessens his accomplishments he is struggling less than any other fighter because the ufc is pushing more deserving fighters backwards for his chance at greatness might as well let him do steroids and fake weigh ins if its all about making money he shouldnt get special treatment no matter how much money he is bringing in and saying its okay is only fucking up the future of this sport
MMA,removed,a motivated bj penn was incredible i still think he beat gsp the first time around

MMA,removed,of course ill watch it i watch every ufc fight im even going to this one live because its in my area but im pissed off because this is a crap show with a bunch of the ufcs manufactured stars that i dont give a shit about paige sage gall these are joke fighters the ufc is trying to package and sell to the mainstream as top talents its an insult to the sport some dipshits on this sub told me you should be grateful it could be has fucking dcrumble and makdessivannata a title fight and an actual top lw prospect going against a super tough opponent oh but i should be happy i got the fucking mousketeers instead what a treat

MMA,removed,i legitimately would not purchase it i would still watch it though via internet stream i may be the only one on this sub that is vocally saying it but there is a lot of other people out there who arent going to consider paying for a dc fight again because that was garbage that is where dc is hurting himself and his fellow fighters truth is dc isnt going to be bringing in big bucks unless they throw him a bone and give him a fight on a mcgregor card as for the jon jones shit you could absolutely be right but to assume you are for sure right is a little naive as of right now in the ufc that fight still counts as a loss for dc until they change that hes always going to have that loss wether he likes it or not you too have a nice weekend man weather is nice out there

MMA,removed,are you actually dumb enough to not understand dc needs to make money he just spent money preparing for the fight he doesnt get to live in moms basement like you he has bills to pay
MMA,removed,it was something like your nickname should be jew because you always get gassed
MMA,removed,so your argument is that dc shouldnt have bothered training because jon jones likely wouldnt fight hahaha man the schools you went to in life were terrible your critical thinking skills are literally worse than an average year old

MMA,removed,conor and a mexican cleaning lady vs dana and trump
MMA,removed,she said it because dana is openly a trump supporter not because its not a diverse sport
MMA,removed,ok i looked it up where in the muhammad ali boxing reform act does in state that anyone already in contract will be released from said contract to fight under another promotion currently this act does not apply to mma fighters it was scheduled for hearing by a subcommittee soon but the swearing in of trump has put that on the back burner while mcgregor is under contract to the ufc he will not fight anywhere else period this includes mayweather

MMA,removed,fake and gay
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,q
MMA,removed,a it is undoubtedly fake and gay b this isnt a wwe subreddit yet you are all upvoting a staged wrestling promo rsquaredcircle seems like a much more appropriate venue for this video
MMA,removed,sure but they dont do them in pro wrestling events and videos of them doing it isnt reposted on rsquaredcircle every so often for years
MMA,removed,i dont care that wwe is fake that is obvious i am saying this staged stand off was meant as a promotion to a wrestling event and it has no business in a mma forum and yes still fake and gay
MMA,removed,i would not be able to fall asleep at i would lay awake until the event started i go to sleep after the events are over for a few hours and i would end up doing the same thing at some point if i got four hours sleep and woke up at this isnt a job its not a regular shift in time zones and a professional engagement people get paid for its a or times a month thing that fucks with a normal sleep schedule you cant compare this to your job the world doesnt revolve around you do you not see how youre a condescending prick for telling people how to watch ufc events on a bad schedule when youve never had to seems like youre an asshole who likes telling other people what to do
MMA,removed,looks like a roast beef sub
MMA,removed,jesus christ shes got a meaty moose knuckle on her i wonder if this picture had anything to do with her getting tested what was it times in week

MMA,removed,the diaz brothers are punks i dont understand why anyone wouldull for white trash thugs
MMA,removed,a relevant comment in this thread was deleted you can read it below i dont think its that clear cut the only absolute advantage i give conor is straight power remember that until he beat mendes conor had a number of very favorable matchups thrown his way remember he was granted a title shot after beating denis siver he has proven his legitmacy as a member of the featherweight elite since but i wouldnt say he has been tested the way frankie has conor getting in early knockouts is impressive but consider their last ten opponents and the ridiculous experience frankie has the username of the original author has been hidden for their own privacy if you are the original author of this comment and want it removed please
MMA,removed,i remember learning that mac danzig was a vegan on the ultimate fighter and being very surprised
MMA,removed,any stream for fedors fight on fight pass really hoping to watch it live
MMA,removed,sensei seagal hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha wait am i in rmma or rtma of all the action stars he is probably the least relevant to mma with his pants shitting fake aikido slinging bad music making ass his aikido shit is faker than pro wrestling httpiimgurcomaxjmngif yes i do understand that interaction was staged or at least that is what i have been led to believe and it seems more likely than not which is why i myself used the words staged promo originally its something that mma fighters and boxers do all the time or are you the kind of mark that knows pro wrestling is fake wow welcome to but thinks the mma hype trains are real and not designed to make money i am sure most mma trash talking is pure hype in fact i am certain of it but i dont go to wwe forums to circlejerk about it for years im more of an mma fan than a pro wrestling fan and i dont like brock lesnar and think he is mediocre as an aussie ive spent most of my time on squared circle educating idiots as to why mark hunt is going to wreck lesnars shit at good try though i genuinely dont know if he will beat mark or not and i think his coming back is good for the sport as it will certainly bring a lot of eyes to it i am not complaining about t in fact let me be real for a second i dont understand pro wrestling and i think it is pretty bizarre as an outsider who didnt grow up watching it it just seems weird but it is entertainment if people like it who am i to say they arent allowed to i like a lot of weird things too like shitty b horror movies cheesy kung fu movies and sci fi in the pantheon of things that are cool my interest in dune probably ranks a lot lower than wwe i do like ribbing wwe fans though specifically the ones that come to talk about pro wrestling in an mma forum i wouldnt think too much about wrestling at all if not for the fact that pro wrestling fans circlejerk about it here brock coming back to the ufc is undoubtedly good for the undercard fighters and i can appreciate that but it comes at the cost of really dumb fans not talking about you who then come to forums i like like the underground rmma and in social media accounts of actual legit mma fighters to talk shit to professional fighters and talk about how so and so pro wrestling would beat them that is super disrespectful and to continue with the analogy i used before jean claude van damme fans would never come here and start posting bs about him being able to beat gsp or whatever and if they did theyd be laughed out of the place the quote i posted before yeah i know it wasnt you who said it but it illustrates my point wwe fans have been clogging up our forums ever since brock got signed and honestly theyre pretty fucking unbearable trolling them by saying fake and gay is pretty fun cause it rustles their jimmies and gets them super defensive but my point has always been rsquaredcircle is a more appropriate venue to talk about wrestling promos the mods are all wwe fans and tolerateencourage this sort of wwe circlejerking but theyre hypocrites cause if i were to post stuff about jet li all day id be banned

MMA,removed,what are you even trying to say here nationally
MMA,removed,thanks armchair pussy im sure youve dodged lots of strikes and know how to throw a proper punch
MMA,removed,no i always didnt like claudia i have been saying claudia is a manipulative bitch for a while i hate pre fight antics both forced and unforced but joannas antics are better than a bitch in flower girls clothing like claudia ref stops fight then she hits after the bell saying shes the real champ as soon as joanna won the belt etc she is just a ho
MMA,removed,dem titties
MMA,removed,safer sport while they beat each others brains out get your head out of your ass safety is an afterthought in this sport and if you want to change that then go watch some karate tournaments with their point fighting bullshit
MMA,removed,this could be legit actually people laughing about a topical cream with shit in it not being detectable need to look up fucking androgel more couch potatoes thinking theyre experts about health and fitness touch a fucking weight
MMA,removed,how did it make you feel when he destroyed aldo did you cry
MMA,removed,oh shit i didnt know that thank you i would have been so upset if i read about how he lostwon on a thread rather than illegally watching a live stream
MMA,removed,how about you lick my furry nuts bloodyelbow is blocked where im at right now
MMA,removed,i was ready to judge you as another idiot with an awful take on usada and then read your first paragraphs you clearly know what youre talking about then i read the last two paragraphs and your solution is just beyond retarded advice quit it with the hot takes and just wait and see if that usada shit will improve over time

MMA,removed,this takes the cake for most autistic
MMA,removed,she already forgot about the entire encounter and it had little to no impact in her life outside of that moment in all reality your daughter wont be some champion fighter lots of kids take karate neither you or your daughter are unique or special there is no happiness or fun in life only suffering the odds of your daughter dying in a car accident overwhelmingly outweigh the odds of her ever doing something noteworthy
MMA,removed,shut your filthy whorish mouth susan
MMA,removed,look at the pay for bottom fighters in bellator now look at bottom pay for the ufc the pay isnt even close
MMA,removed,lol no one said he is hes a young prospect young prospects arent top fighters give it time hes fucking years old
MMA,removed,ummmmm its pretty popular everywhere sans the uk and ireland
MMA,removed,dont be delusional and please have a well rounded view when coming to the table please sir i was planning in engaging in a conversation but if youre going to be condescending you can fuck off
MMA,removed,take out that sweaty hog of yours and let me get a suck on it detective
MMA,removed,calm down either conor or nate would be a completely justified title shot khabib has one win in years and ferguson almost got kod by a noob nate is ranked with a win over the fw champ and conor is the fw champ who just kod the best fighter all of them have an argument
MMA,removed,no they arent conor is a fw seeing as how hes champ there nate is a very large lw hes even missed weight to get there conor has never missed weight nate is a full weight class larger than conor at least
MMA,removed,when did they ever
MMA,removed,hcg prevents none of the stuff you listed if anything taking hcg can cause everything you listedit spikes your estrogen extremely high the only correct statement you made is the restart process clomidaromasinarimidex all killblock estrogen preventing the sides you listed not hcg they also already mentioned it was clomid making your statement even more incorrect
MMA,removed,against rda
MMA,removed,the only person who deserves a shot in that division is ferguson and he almost got kod by an undersized no name khabib being ranked is a joke seeing how he has only fought once in two years against a complete no name dariush got gifted a win against johnson who nate beat the brakes off of plus he lost to chiesa chiesas has yet to beat anyone in the top same with poirier whom conor completely destroyed conor is the lw champ and would have a win over nate which is completely justified title shot nate would have a win over johnson and the fighter in the ufc which is completely justified for a title shot not to mention conor and nate would sell way more but thats a different conversation
MMA,removed,he was doing blow off strippers assholes in abq before it was cool
MMA,removed,a cheating brazilian accusing someone else of cheating nothing new here move on folks
MMA,removed,he is brazilian its a given brasil is just as bad with doping as russia they just lack the sophistication

MMA,removed,waiting for ufc rousey vs trump
MMA,removed,wtf is up with this golden shower
MMA,removed,first they came for the socialists and i did not speak outâ because i was not a socialist then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak outâ because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews and i did not speak outâ because i was not a jew then they came for meâand there was no one left to speak for me i suggest you get familiar with that quote one day these companies will be in your back yard instead of the back yard of someone else and you may want others to care then in that situation i doubt you will be championing the get americans back to work catchphrase that you have been told to embrace if americans need work education can help you get higher paying jobs in industries that dont destroy the natural beauty and notyet contaminated landsfoodwater of the united states i think true patriots would want to preserve that rather than the jobs that help destroy american landsfoodwater but hey republicans hate democrats and if that means they have to back the oil companies no matter what i understand they will do it i wish you good luck that no oil company finds anything they want in your back yard because many americans have suffered from that scenario and if you dont care about them dont expect them to care about you

MMA,removed,i would pay for a celebrity judo match where ronda uchimatas trump into tropicana
MMA,removed,the ass was fat
MMA,removed,ronda is so gullible and narrow minded when it comes to researching things she is as easily duped by the nodapl bullshit as she is by edmund she fell for the white guilt bait ew nodapl has always been a money grab by all kinds of fraudsters from the tribal leader to corporations to individual natives and wannabe hippies its gross well trump will put an end to this soon and the violent protesters will have to go back to begging for money at antitrump rallies and doing whatever they do yelling and attacking people breaking stuff while smelling bad then crying when they get their asses kicked
MMA,removed,yes there was a typo it happens when you type on a small cellphone keyboard sometimes im glad you got your grammar nazi fix

MMA,removed,whats your favourite submission move in mma or grappling
MMA,removed,not pinoy but i found channel stream to try to watch this live found out it was going tape delay a week later now you dont get to see the card and the title fight on the top of the card never happened as well it sucks visibility of of most importance thus acb having youtube streams mirr on commentary and legit top rankings really set it aside from others
MMA,removed,here in south africa all ufc main event cards is available for as low as about a month on fox sports httpstarsatcoza for anybody in sa interested but im a cord cutter so im stuck with fightpass for prelims and illegal streams for main events
MMA,removed,then its not an ama is it its ask what we tell you you can ask fuck off with that shite
MMA,removed,what are the first three things that you think of when i say ubereem

MMA,removed,dat ass tho
MMA,removed,chael sonnen really is the donald trump of mma
MMA,removed,heres what she said first dumb thing ive heard chael say its like stating the sky is blue and expecting that to be a revelation stop paraphrasing
MMA,removed,wow now we know how trump felt in moscow
MMA,removed,he called the cops hopefully the kid is getting questioned right now shows you how stupid this kid must be thousands of people globally now know his identity and are going to spam his family and friends with shit also the cops are going to keep him on some list of potential sex predators if theres any sexual offence in the area they are going to come knocking
MMA,removed,so marketable
MMA,removed,so many hot russians getting into mma recently including the goat candidate hottie anastasia yankova
MMA,removed,shes a little late after trump signed that executive order sorry ronda
MMA,removed,is nobody looking at that ass goth blessth
MMA,removed,is nobody looking at that ass goth blessth
MMA,removed,fuck off michael
MMA,removed,its about the delivery dipshit lol the irony of not knowing the delivery is most of a the humor in a joke and then calling others dumb garry recently has been going on the cringe world tour with his terrible preplanned and ripped off jokes with no charisma
MMA,removed,in fairness real bartenders probably dont use michael bispings ejaculate either
MMA,removed,id titty fuck you
MMA,removed,id say so he super heavyweight httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvnfltcxewk

MMA,removed,lol op has in the past submitted to rwhiterights link archives
MMA,removed,fire away
MMA,removed,i clicked on the comment section to see one asshole get downvoted to oblivion im glad to see that justice has already been served
MMA,removed,i had the biggest man crush on ronaldo with hair dude was a stud credit to uallelbows aka esther lin for the pic
MMA,removed,its a shame that when i watch fights on fight pass its fps but on some other streams its the same resolution but
MMA,removed,is your goal to be the most obnoxious and annoying fight in the ufc
MMA,removed,damn youre really butthurt huh i couldve said i was going to play video games instead of arguing instead of weed why the hell would you care unless you just like being an asshole cody won and was better he destroyed cruz and deserved that win that credit enough the cody fanboy who couldnt even acknowledge that he was clearly dropped is calling me a fanboy because i have dissenting opinion of a rematch you got me dying im also watching tv and on other websites while high am i still a loser even though other days im with family friends or working and just enjoy time chilling by myself youre just an asshole man and your attitude makes me doubt your training or at least how often you train most of the deadliest grapplers in most gyms are some of the most chill humble people prove me wrong lets spar you trying to meet up
MMA,removed,you make rmma gay
MMA,removed,i know this video has been posted a lot but are there more videos like this where celebrities react to a ufc fight live
MMA,removed,no he is fucking like that all the time nowhow many times did he cry and mention mental illness
MMA,removed,i didnt hear anything i read it you uneducated mouth breather georges took advantage of a fatigued lazy takedown from a wrestling dependent fighter who knew he was beat halfway through the shot this exact scramble happens almost every fight night i love gsp but to say godlike just grow up and learn the sport
MMA,removed,against the same opposition but if i beat bums in shitty parking lot fights have i had a better year than mcgregor you are so retarded whenever mcgregor is being talked about it is actually embarrassing
MMA,removed,anyone know any good live streams for australia
MMA,removed,i think youll need to find a stream last bellator was shown on a week later
MMA,removed,best get a stream then because bellator doesnt give a flying fuck about uk fans
MMA,removed,as in torrent old replays or live streams either way can you send me the link
MMA,removed,arent their good streams on the mma streams reddit or do they not bother cause its free in the us
MMA,removed,you seem slightly tarded
MMA,removed,so edgy
MMA,removed,yes you are lol pure being a whinge and you think typing in that tone makes you sound smart suffer through is many language he post was announcing a free weekend of service which represents a positive thing to mps t people but your comment is clearly complaining get your head out of your ass if you feel entitled to a free month of fightpass contact them directly stop moaning on here nobody gives a fuck
MMA,removed,the original question makes no mention of fights that are mindboggling in retrospect though an upset like michael bisping in knocking out champ luke rockhold on a week notice is quite a bit different than solid gatekeepersjourneymen in pickett and palaszewski beating two new and untested fighters in johnson and pettis while certainly interesting results to look back on theyre by very definition not even close to being upsets maybe its you who has a problem with reading comprehension
MMA,removed,but then they wouldnt get to try and tell someone they are wrong
MMA,removed,haha i was wondering how youd watch mma there regularly i went for a few months doing charity work and had to stream the mcgregor diaz fight in on a phone screen and it cost me a tenner ððð
MMA,removed,but thats dumb thats like saying rumble johnson vs koscheck was a massive upset in retrospect when it wasnt even close to an upset at the time koscheck was a topranked welterweight and rumble johnson wasnt an especially good welterweight at all went back and forth with kevin burns in their first matchup ignoring the late eyepoke rich clementi vs rumble being another example
MMA,removed,look at gleesons upper body and look at khabibs
MMA,removed,just stream them on the internet thats how i fight the power
MMA,removed,this would have been a perfect opportunity to show some cleavage downvoted
MMA,removed,damn you autistic its cool this is a safe space
MMA,removed,its a shame that he is left out the question of the best pound for pound fighter cue conor mcgregor fans
MMA,removed,i bet chael can he has beaten all of them
MMA,removed,great youve got the link go find it for me now
MMA,removed,get fucked cunt
MMA,removed,lol the cucks are down voting us bravo good sir for the link this will russell their jimmies
MMA,removed,haha i dont need to do anything the r a g i n g p o v e r t y in colombia will kill you sooner or later anyway ð
MMA,removed,good thing your shit pick for goat dosent matter at all
MMA,removed,tell him this to his face
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my page then you peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,how respectful of you towards wmmas biggest figure in its history
MMA,removed,shane carwin during his cycle
MMA,removed,youre talking out of your ass if you did follow brendan you would know he defends shane vehemently all the time all the time this was taken out of context and presented in a different way than what he meant maybe follow up more get off a mms fighters dick before speaking and trying to get attention
MMA,removed,i just dont get this guys way of thinking look at what he wrote for bisping im gonna replace bisping with woodley you tell me if this checks out it is surreal to call woodley the no welterweight on the planet and see a ufc title around his waist but there can be no denying him after a firstround knockout over robbie lawler this is a crazy unpredictable sport ladies and gentlemen this writer is either an idiot or salty towards woodley or riding wonderboys dick could be all
MMA,removed,carwin injected in the wrong spot again darn it i hate it when that happens
MMA,removed,uhomer is probably some thirteenyearold dipshit who drinks mountain dew for breakfast and thinks fruit rollups count as a food group
MMA,removed,sounds like something my girlfriend would say during a cuck sesh
MMA,removed,ive always kinda thought that was what happened with chelsea manning
MMA,removed,are you negrodaumus
MMA,removed,well mcgregor fans look eeeeeeeeeeeeexactly how i thought they would
MMA,removed,being raped
MMA,removed,sir i dont recall saying any of this horseshit youre talking about put some respect on my opinion and shut the fuck up if hes using rest assured ill suck my own dick and you can watch

MMA,removed,youre a moron stop sucking his dick hes already admitting to using steroids on this very forum though this was after he said he never knowingly used them get a grip dude
MMA,removed,oh ffs stop sucking his dick hes already admitting to using steroids on this very forum though this was after he said he never knowingly used them get a grip dude
MMA,removed,that would be pretty fucken cool actually get that stick out of your ass and enjoy mmas popularity
MMA,removed,hahaha you proper scrawny little virgin getting mad about that theyll make more money in one night than you will in your entire shit life keep hating motherfucker
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my page then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,shut up science bitch
MMA,removed,you cant even post a readable and comprehensive reddit comment go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,so because hes taunted you unprovoked and youre too much of a pussy bitch to actually speak face to face and clear the air you try drag his name through the dirt in your special brand of sleazy shitty media ugh youre so distasteful just stop everything
MMA,removed,what kind of an asshole cares about animal rights
MMA,removed,ufc is not a european country i think you are lucky to have anything at all
MMA,removed,hey fuck off guys i love them

MMA,removed,down vote for fam are you years old
MMA,removed,id fuck that ass if i were you
MMA,removed,fuck no she has more testosterone in her than any man ive ever met if you went down on her you would test positive from usada for months after she would tighten every lid in the kitchen just to fuck with you she would punk your dad out of the last hamburger on of july shane carwin is scared of her she ripped the head off a pygmy and justin wren just pretended it didnt happen she killed kimbo slice she pinned triple h shes a god damned shaved sasquatch it should be criminal to actually teach her proper striking technique
MMA,removed,bitch needs to get off the steroids so she is the size of a regular woman then she might have some opponents
MMA,removed,youre worse than than people that say mcgregor almost won yea ferguson didnt lose and won with a darce choke which is impressive hey arm chair warrior train some mma i know you never been in a fight in your life
MMA,removed,and i want pvz to sit on my face but sometimes in life things dont go the way you want
MMA,removed,sullivan you chode i owe you a shot to the nuts
MMA,removed,i like eddie but idk he doesnt interest me this kids philadelphia you dumb motherfucker
MMA,removed,yea i have i put my money where my mouth is unlike you arm chair warrior
MMA,removed,thugs is too glamorous of a term for them they are non athletes that dont know dick about the sport they are ruling on they are spoiled brats that likely got their jobs based off of nepotism or retardation
MMA,removed,nick and nate are not the same size you realize height and reach doesnt equal size right not to mention nick has a longer reach than nate you think george roop is bigger than daniel cormier
MMA,removed,get a job dork
MMA,removed,id pee in her butt
MMA,removed,month is one thing taking almost all of his pay is something else fucking thugs i dont understand either why the death threats stopped they should be under pressure until they resign from their position thugs need to be treated with their own medicine post their numbers on twitter find out their home addresses lets go
MMA,removed,gtfo
MMA,removed,and is the best i can do
MMA,removed,this isnt your safe space gtfo out of here with your blatant lies
MMA,removed,write it in your diary i deleted it you over sensitive dorks who couldnt get laid to save their fucking life
MMA,removed,get a grip it was picture no one died here you fucking bible camp chaperone
MMA,removed,this is how you spot a whitey if you dont know aldos background dont even comment having a tough upbringing defines you gives you character and discipline its not victimization of course it can seem that way to you since youve had the privilege to be white and not grow up poor in brazil no wonder woodley and angela is fed up with your kind
MMA,removed,you chose to make a comment about being sick of poverty stricken people being able to do something with their lives because its a clichÃ© to you its a clichÃ© for you because cant relate and you feel alienated hearing about it its always white people who says that never heard anyone from other races thats why i brought it up
MMA,removed,oh a puppet decides to speak up for the man hope theyll treat you well when it comes down to it
MMA,removed,who cares you freak
MMA,removed,and be the king of manlets
MMA,removed,people following fighting seem to have more brain damage than the actual fighters what a bellend
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up you are also not allowed to pump yourself full of banned illegal chemicals and defraud banks and blah blah blah blah
MMA,removed,hmmmm lets look at your post history to see if youve said anything else about aldo kid was born fell on a grill won some fights lost a fight retired story the numbers assigned by the ufc are meaningless id rather him have fought max even me a staunch believer in the get off aldos dick movement believe only a fucking idiot thought edgar could best aldo and i like edgar but common sense didnt have edgar winning and reality like common sense is a mysterious bitch to people who cant stop riding dicks so please rmma get off your fighters dick just look at things from an off of dick perspective and stop jerking off over who did what years ago and how many fedors it takes to chop down a werdum because yesterday is gone and tomorrow will be a glorious day i know im just hoping to break awareness to my newest movement getoffaldosdick i think getting off aldos dick would bring a lot to the sport in general and i for one hope he does indeed gtfo and go somewhere else because hes constantly injured and a whiny bitch i hope one day soon you too can get off aldos dick nah aldo is constantly whining about how he got his shit pushed in like a prison wife the day of the instant rematch needs to have died a long time ago and if you really want to fight someone you need to bend to make it happen not them im tired of aldo being a whiny bitch and im even more tired of his fucking nut hugger fans retire aldo get the fuck out of here and go to bellator the rmmatards will miss you but the buy rate from ppv will show you didnt matter yeah but i think that kind of stuff is bullshit anyways i dont care who you are or how impressive your reigning dick thingy or we is you got shut the fuck down back of the top line win or and and earn a title shot nobody should get a title shot because they held the title before they fucking lost it because someone better came and took it from them aldo is a pussy ass bitch if he wants to fight conor so bad grow a fucking sack and fight him fighters are way to prissy these days this isnt interpretive dance man the fuck up aldo or shut the fuck up well would you look at that paragraph after paragraph of you being obnoxious while trying to shit on aldo half the stuff you post getting removed the rest is you hugging mcgregors nuts while insisting that youre not a nuthugger i pretty much never use this word but i believe youre what the kids call a hater
MMA,removed,check out some excerpts from his post history dude is a certified hater and i normally dont even use that word
MMA,removed,because people would figure out that youre an insecure short fuck yourself and conor almost always had a decent size advantage over his opponents at featherweight
MMA,removed,kid was born made retarded comments on reddit got downvoted learned to stop making retarded comments
MMA,removed,you cant find porn lol
MMA,removed,stupid fuck he wasnt the champ for years
MMA,removed,you might be a little slow so ill spell it out nice and easy for you from aldos first title defense till his last successful title defense there have been months he defended the title times within that time period that means he defended a title on average every months which is twice a year now sit down and shut the fuck up about aldo taking years in between fights and barely ever fighting fighting and beating number contenders twice a year on average for that long is not something most fighters can do sit down
MMA,removed,aw fuck off thats high adrenaline and losing your composure for a few secondsa few seconds where schaub coulve just as easily put ben away after having him on queer street i bet your head movement would have been spot on and youd have finished him with a flying kimura though right champ fuckin dolt
MMA,removed,damn you conor nuthuggers dont stop
MMA,removed,general discussion thread

MMA,removed,dude stfu christ you sound as whiney as fucking aldo mcgregor wont get a rematch with eddie if he loses
MMA,removed,thats only pounds more than wanderlei silva in a wig
MMA,removed,he had the ufc belt for years and defended it times you need to get back to primary school
MMA,removed,not particularly but i like fucking with the kids here when im bored shit reasonable and well thought out responses get downvoted too so whats the point here everyone here is an edgy angsty child might as well enjoy it as a non politically correct society
MMA,removed,your mom
MMA,removed,shut your fookin mooth
MMA,removed,good job on ruining the ufc and making every other fighter realize they need to move on to a different sport got to love people celebrating the effective doom of mma as a sport and welcome boxing format fucking idiots
MMA,removed,how do you compare a guy who is arguably the greatest boxer of all time with a perfect record of to a guy with fights in the ufc and a record of gtfo
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,leprechaun
MMA,removed,man just shut the fuck up about it
MMA,removed,mendes stands orthodox and took mcgreggor down easily
MMA,removed,dunno why people are downvoting you i agree conor thrives on bullying his opponents like firas zahabi has said and its exactly how that fight would go frankie would either stand and get his face busted up and knocked out or try to shoot over and over like against aldo and get stuffed every time
MMA,removed,sad cunt get on with your life and stop wasting it hating
MMA,removed,shitpost
MMA,removed,that is a scaaaaaaary douchebag
MMA,removed,you werent thats why everyone thinks youre a twat
MMA,removed,shut your bitch ass up your comment has downvotes youre the epitemy of a internet loser trying to be a tough guy lol
MMA,removed,it means youre a faggot
MMA,removed,stfu its perfect
MMA,removed,but you are throwing out old insults based on his appearance same difference really
MMA,removed,training with a guy who would be in the little boy belt division is waaay different than what hell encounter facing top tier lws in the ufc im nervous for conor
MMA,removed,peaked piqued you have a liberal arts degree the least you could do is get your spelling grammar right
MMA,removed,who da fook is dis
MMA,removed,was it a hard decision going in to cagefighting when you knew you had a promising career in food services
MMA,removed,getting punched in the face is sounds a lot better than majoring in those fields
MMA,removed,will you marry me mahalo
MMA,removed,holy shit are you employed by someone to come here and shit on conor in every fucking post here i see your comments holy shit get a life man so much hate is not good for you
MMA,removed,dry your eyes little one
MMA,removed,but you ride his dick as much as his most loyal fans do
MMA,removed,not a fighter the coaches that were calling his wife a diseased whore so how about you stop trying to make everything seem black and white and gtfo with your nonsense
MMA,removed,no im not wrong everyone apparently just cant read saying that rockhold should not be a huge favorite over dan henderson does not mean that henderson should be the favorite go back to school and learn english because you didnt do well enough the first time
MMA,removed,if youre aware then why the fuck are you asking its exactly the same thing if conor suddenly decided he wants to fight for rizin he would be breaking the contract and would be penalizedsued in the jurisdiction they chose for the amount they agreed
MMA,removed,do you support hillary and her plan to fight isis
MMA,removed,you actually dont know what the fuck you are talking about stop reading instagram and facebook posts and figure it out on your own dipshit
MMA,removed,hands down one of the worst things about mma at the moment is douchebag mcgregor fans not the real mma fans who like him im on about the ones who got into mma through a couple of memes on facebook and the ones who disrespect fighters etc because of him i think hes a an amazing fighter but he makes so many people act like assholes because hes got a attitude of a asshole i dont care about things like yeh hes hyping the fight or hes using it to get into peoples heads imo the dudes still a asshole the way he talks shit on fighters because of his money etc just rubs me the wrong way and a big portion of his fans are making mma a joke whatever rant over
MMA,removed,maybe you should make a new subreddit called rmmafags where you go to circle jerk about the same opinions and cry cause your feelings were too overwhelming
MMA,removed,are we talking about the same conor who never planned to retire and got exactly what he wanted and the same conor who made aldo cry and leave the ufc with his massive shlong that i would suck if he asked
MMA,removed,well arent you just a sanctimonious cunt
MMA,removed,this is reddit you can find out exactly what the person who i called a nerdknight is interested in in this case umertonjdingle is even more pathetic than you his first page post history is literally nothing but gushing about ronda rousey and attacking others for insulting her honor his damsel has called cyborg an it who is merely mocking hondas weight in turn she has bragged about domestic abuse against her exboyfriend called all housewives stay at home moms models do nothing bitches she is up there with the most disgusting mma fighters in character infact she should and could have domestic violence charges and a jail history given her bragging he seems exactly like a don quoxite nerd knight to me maybe he has fantasies e honda housey will beat him up and give him a blowjob with enough time put in defending her nonexistent internet honor you live in the wilderness with no computer and internet yet you have a reddit account full of recent posts only to rmma sounds like you are making up bs this is reddit with a subreddit system of thousands of separate forums and not a mma only forum if someone like you is only posting to the rmma it is because you are only interested in mma keep trying to mask that you really are pathetic enough that mma and is the be all and end all of your interests
MMA,removed,i am an adult with adult interests that is why i have more interests than just rmma obnoxious lulzkid also i didnt look at that guys post history to prove anything to such a onedimensional loser as you hours ago i looked at his profile after he made another reply as he made yet another groveling i must defend hondas honor post i already told you when people write stuff really stupid or really learned i look at their histories to know where they are coming from how exactly does someone without a computer or cable allegedly living in the remove wilderness reply within a few minutes also
MMA,removed,fuck off he can thank whoever he wants
MMA,removed,that is even worse giving serious adult replies to adult discussions over the twitter limit is difficult on a shitty smartphone using a fake onscreen keyboard and one finger tisk tisk mr big adult
MMA,removed,have you literally never worked out and gotten a pump before fuck youre posting dumb shit here wouldnt surprise me plus two entirely different pictures in literally every fashion from filter to angle to lighting to just smashed someone in a cage verse standing on a scale
MMA,removed,he beat the baby out of her thats why shes not pregnant
MMA,removed,nice now eat each others pussies
MMA,removed,lesbian porn is all i jerk off to tho
MMA,removed,i think you are perhaps the most pathetic creature i have encountered on reddit which is saying on alot you think defending the honor of fair rousey who is one of the worst characters in a sport that is just glorified human cock fighting is some noble pursuit get over yourself tone policing feminized male
MMA,removed,jew meshed
MMA,removed,i once find a free stream of a korean porn channel there are music channels here that are far more raunchy

MMA,removed,go fuck yourself with your bullshit he should not have to fight any more of the top guys to prove anything there are plenty of people he could go in against to keep him busy and earn some money while he waits for his shot there is plenty of fucking precedent for matches like that to be made dont be an asshole

MMA,removed,stfu nerd
MMA,removed,tim elliot wins
MMA,removed,both our comments got deleted but im gonna respond anyways why are you trying to act like such a dominant billy bada in such a trivial argument over the internet have they taught you in college what a hypocrite is because it seems like that concept is lost on you you accuse me of trying to act like a bada in such a trivial argument over the internet and then proceed to try to act in the same manner you just described im guessing youre a trump supporter too get over yourself nerd youre probably some teenaged couch potato obsessed with mma because of mcgregor in fact you probably have never thrown a punch in your life nor know what it feels like to get punched scale back your alpha attitude you meager headed dt youre only acting tough because youre anonymous on the internet look here kid ive been watching mma before your balls dropped since youre such a bada lets make a mans bet pretend to be a man for this ok if cowboys injury is fake you change your sub flair to say im mikeymayhems bitch if his injury is real ill change my flair to say im vinnythehammers bitch and the person who loses has to keep that flair for a year so step or stfu its up to you
MMA,removed,hes doing it for attention and its working
MMA,removed,there has been a lot of the discussion on this sub about why he did this you can google all about it and i bet hitler didnt mean to do what he did but the complains made it worse
MMA,removed,if elliot loses to dj i would love to see him call out cejudo
MMA,removed,im not pretending ronda said she wont fight cyborg at any other weight than and cyborg said she cant make but can make thats what is stopping the fight from happening i just see no reason that the fight cant happen at a different weight than when both fighters have regularly competed at much higher weight classes cyborg has never fought below in her entire career rousey competed in judo at and mma at i want to see the money fight happen ronda has judo matches at ronda competed times in judo at from ronda fought times at in mma from ronda has mma fights at from cyborg has fought at twice recently once early in her career times total all of her other fights are at rousey has twice the amount of fights at higher weights than cyborgs when you account for judo ronda has talked about her issues with making weight she has an eating disorder and mental issues that can exacerbate her condition i am curious as to how she is going to make the upcoming cut when she has been inactive and gained weight but thats besides the point as far as cyborg needs to lose muscle mass youre asking someone to do something to their body that has never done it before asking for cyborg to make her late career debut at a lower weight class i dont understand it and i try but cant make sense of that viewpoint i feel as though by losing muscle mass people seem to insinuate that cyborg needs to stop taking steroids shes bad because of that for some reason ive never really seen a fighter lose muscle to make weight shes getting usada tested out the ass so shes trying to play fair its not strikeforce i say fuck it let juiced up cyborg snusnu fight her it would be akin to nate diaz demanding lawler or woodley to fight at instead of people have bitched about titles and catchweights on the forums for so long and it has always annoyed me i want to see good fights cyborg vs rousey is a good fight just bleed just look at her cut to that documentary really gives insight i remember a video of her coach handing her a plate of food and she had this look on her face like she was scared and said something like i can eat this it really showed how much she suffers to cut and lastly i want to see rousey and other women fight cyborg not a dehydrated near death cyborg it seems so simple to me i think holm said she would do it whether they make it i dont care cyborg said shell do it ive never seen cyborg fight at she may not be the same fighter but shes a good fighter at she has been there her entire career she has shown how hard it is for her to move down a for effort let the fight happen
MMA,removed,yeah he doesnt get many finishes so theres no amazing highlight reel of kos to get people excited for his fights hes finished out of his last fights saying he doesnt finish fights at this point would be as silly as still calling dan henderson decision dan yeah hendo had a stretch in his career where he had a lot of decisions and so did dj but that shit isnt fucking current at all like not even a little bit current you guys are holding onto a decision spree that ended in the last time dj had back to back decision victories kobe bryant was still years away from retiring im not gonna bother to try to diagnose why dj hasnt been terribly popular in the ufc lately but for anyone to say that the problem is that he doesnt finish fights i have to just flat out counter that youre completely fucking wrong like as wrong as you possibly could be jon jones has finished out of his last dj has finished out of his last and you fucking idiots are still sitting here saying the problem is that dj doesnt finish fights fuck off youre all idiots
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here

MMA,removed,holy fuck the level of retarded you and this guy are exhibiting is infuriating i would think about me yes but i would also think about the people i have hit not because i am a person on the internet but because i would care put all of that aside i would have enough sense to mention that i was worried about the person and her unborn child
MMA,removed,its bullshit that you can claim he clearly wanted to transition when every time conor opened his mouth on the subject his reiterated time and time again he would and could be an active weight champion you can claim that he might not have gone down to again you can claim a lot of shit but to say clearly fuck off

MMA,removed,i know this reddit is largely against piracy but you are paying and have these problems at least when a free stream goes offline you dont feel that dissapointed because it was suppose to happen eventually when its a good ppv i have three streams running all seconds behind each other so if one goes down i simply switch over to the next one thats a minute behind and if all three go down i have a list of links i can click on to bring up new ones its not perfect from ethics and quality standpoint but it works at least it works and its consistent

MMA,removed,german here this pains me to no end i want my money going to fighters so i like to pay i bought all ppvs until now every single time there were problems with ranfighting and the worst even when it worked the pirate stream had higher bitrate and higher fps so it looked waaaay better than the official one so i started watching the pirate stream even though i had paid for the event after the problems with ufc i am demanding my money back since it didnt work and i will not pay for ranfighting again this in and in times of and streams is ridiculous
MMA,removed,same in france ppv and fight pass cards well all events in fact are blacked out and you have to pay for a tv channel that you can only have with one single isp plus i want to heard joe rogan etc i want the original not a french guy that i know from nowhere talking instead and i cant buy ppv i would but yep only america matters i guess

MMA,removed,check his flair youre wasting your time if you think conor fanboys will make any coherent or meaningful posts
MMA,removed,hopefully if they do make a movie they point out how conor hasnt defended a single belt a single time leapfrogged deserving contenders and for some reason wasnt required to vacate his fw belt when moving to lw like dana demanded aldo do when aldo wanted to do that very thing but no it will just be a another knobjob for conor sucking his dick like all you people are doing
MMA,removed,it was the same with the euros on rte player or players just such useless quality for live games firstrowsport streams were far better quality and thats saying something

MMA,removed,you are typical hater
MMA,removed,well i would say it depends on what you want your striking to accomplish a fact in mma is that pure wrestling gets you fucked up see mousasi vs king mo king mo lost that fight regardless what decision said in mma you need to learn how to strike to use wrestling striking is simply a tool and used to reach an end goal whether that be getting a knockout or getting to grappling and if we want to talk what gets the job done id say khabib has sufficent striking to dominate other strikers or even grapplers mma requires a total package and a good strategy and as much as i hate muslim russian terrorists i cant discredit this russian terrorists skill i really want to see his shit pushed in so people need to step up their mma games when he was chanting his allah shit on the mic post fight in msg that was a fuckin shit show i was absolutley disgusted with his allah chanting shit on the mic someone needs to beat this terrorist

MMA,removed,annnd hereÂ´s the homophobe
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,upset lol what the fuck are you talking about you must be one of those idiots that get super flustered everytime you see something that goes against what you think so you project that salty type of trash onto the person youre responding to then you went on an idiotic rant proving exactly what i was talking about seriously kid
MMA,removed,how long before someones get triggered by his comment and writes an entire paragraph on how werdum is anti lbgt and is a bigot
MMA,removed,yes thats exactly what im telling you lol why the fuck did you think i wrote that comment because i saw it happen already
MMA,removed,act like a moron and you get put into the ditch like a moron there are many people out there walking around packing heat you start shit with a dude on his bad day you might end up with a bullet in your head
MMA,removed,jiu jitsu world champ calling out a young kid with obvious loop holes in his ground game isnt cowardly to you lol
MMA,removed,fuck dude you think youre pretty rad dont you or did you just not get enough attention as a child
MMA,removed,cody on that silence of the lambspsychopath shit probably wears a conor mask and jack off into a mirror
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,she was the problem with not wanting to fight for the belt she was the problem she complained for near a decade for not having a division and when the ufc created one just for her she declined how far do you have cyroids cock up your ass for you to be this blind
MMA,removed,yea convinent how i just proved that mcgregor prob gets max of what he brings in mcgregor and the ufc combined not that difficult to understand and i asked you how you being a true fan gives you any more credence than anyone else that is a tunes into watch ufc fights because i actually care about the direction of the sport i actually watch fights other than just mcgregors you help build it from the ground up you took care of their lawyer fees you an mma fighter trying to hype to the sport you hosting events you making sure all these events can see the light day with all the government regulations in place thats what true fans do not your pretentious grade bs what the fuck are you talking about why are you bringing up lawyer fees yeah i do my small little part in trying to help build up the sport i reach out to people in my social circle and get them to watch events beyond just the major ones i produce and disseminate mma related content on social media its not much but i do what i can from my current position to help the sport i love mma and i hope to work in the industry one day im not saying people have to follow the sport as closely as i do but theres a huge difference between people who only watch one fighter and those who try even a little to learn about mma
MMA,removed,manlets when will they ever learn
MMA,removed,we what you were trying to do but it didnt work
MMA,removed,questions how does she go from trying tapping out to a choke to breaking free and koing him with a kick how does this douche find a training partner after this what kind of noodles was he hoping for
MMA,removed,and we all called him an asshole and then some reddit cux told us he was actually a good dude now this fuck him what a fucking idiot
MMA,removed,bahhaha he got beat up by a girl
MMA,removed,correct fuck the wwe mentality of creating drama ill watch a fight if the fighters are talented people like conor need to shut the fuck up and fight
MMA,removed,sounds like none of you understand the frustration of being bought the wrong noodles
MMA,removed,what a pos hope he rots in prison how could you do this to the women who just brought you food should be charged with attempted murder and never get out again
MMA,removed,how do you like them noodles
MMA,removed,its just that he always has that real smug look on his facehe looks like he would eat out of his own asshole while wearing nothing except satisfaction and that weird ass costume shop beard
MMA,removed,he will always consider england his home are you from clitheroe clit heroe
MMA,removed,other than your dad what are you talking about his dad is an asshole s p
MMA,removed,fuck off dickhead
MMA,removed,your mum is a milf mate
MMA,removed,so which noodles was she supposed to get
MMA,removed,sucks but i can empathize with the guy i once beat my gf into a coma when she got me a plain mcchicken instead of a buffalo ranch mcchicken these things happen
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,i put my gf in chokes alltid time and i teep and legkick her all the time too now i dont do this hard but it could easily be spun that way
MMA,removed,she probably got glass or egg noodle instead of shirataki i understand his frustration
MMA,removed,i dont think we should rush to judgement until we know what kind of noodles they actually were
MMA,removed,no its about new content audios or videos or both content not posted in rmma in any way before that are being removedprohibited
MMA,removed,autist
MMA,removed,its more or less that exactly i understood to be like this if that day chael or robbie lawer make an interview in which they talk about gspsilva thats allowed but if they do another interview like with different host or interviewer or whatever and the topic include gspsilva then mods wont allow that to be posted and removeban it
MMA,removed,it was not same content thats your opinion and thats the whole point of the thread to discuss about thats not it at all its exactly that
MMA,removed,man every word i said its true he saying not representative but he did told me he operated that way if you want i can post he history for you to see and the removal of a chael interview indeed happened which was not a duplicate
MMA,removed,i had no wish to discuss with the mod team you wanted that you said to me that the procedure was to first modmail it and i did it but you all kept insisting on exactly what i am saying in the thread and i didnt see that to be right so if you really are convinced of that and gonna keep using that removal logic why the sub community cant know about it let people decide or approve
MMA,removed,hey rmma i have a serious question for you lets say a user notice that legit threads are getting removed threads that have nothing against the rules what that user should do do the sub have a right to know should mod let the discussion take place andor remove anything that even remotely nods to it like this comment
MMA,removed,thats because even if you hate michael bisping you are still a fan because he entertains you i love that nigga though i hate fights where i dont want anyone to lose
MMA,removed,nope buzz told me before a thread can be posted as it must be first submitted to the modmail and that we mods discuss about these stuff in the back all the time i never wanted to waste your time by sending it to modmail and opinions are the thing here like you said why cant we have users opinions as well and its not complaining its friendly discussing
MMA,removed,dude went from roiding then to heroin and you are planning to give him a heros welcome what the fuck kind of white privilege shit is this dude
MMA,removed,im from preston and have always hated it when the say your dad is from manchester its a bit of a drive to mancester from clithero
MMA,removed,tuna cassarole begins to swing
MMA,removed,gtfo
MMA,removed,you can tell from this post that she is also probably a toxic and unstable person probably two pieces of trash that deserved each other
MMA,removed,just shut up obvs i know
MMA,removed,you actually just disproved your own point if ufc didnt have the money then it would have been destroyed a long time ago was it running on sunshine and unicorn farts this whole time youre going to have to put a bit more effort into fashioning an actual thought your stream of conscious doesnt even address my argument which might sound like im encouraging you to continue typing but i assure you id rather have type diabetes then continue arguing with someone for whom capital letters and full stops are luxury items
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,im saying that its their job aldo lived in the favelas through fighting he is living a much better life now what the fuck are you doing on rmma anyway
MMA,removed,your mom must of done heroin when she was pregnant
MMA,removed,i swear shes the female
MMA,removed,i guess this is part of the gender fluid whatever its called going on in society right now that lil dude is going around in a bikini and no one is gawking good for him to be so confident
MMA,removed,here we are to save the day
MMA,removed,the one big difference is that nobody gives a shit about what you have to say
MMA,removed,you need to chiiiiillll man all signs pointed to heroin for reasons i have stated i was wrong apparently but wont be losing any sleep about it you sound upset that people were speculating
MMA,removed,projecting fuck off dude just look at how many women they have headlining cards its rare to see a headliner that isnt a title fight because men are simply more consistent draws i dont care at all about your anecdotal evidence and its weird for you to assume that im not personally interested in wmma for no reason other than my comment on the publics general interest level
MMA,removed,bisping is so weak it hurts it must suck dick to be british
MMA,removed,i am a huge conor fan
MMA,removed,its simple minded people like you that dont understand the difference between arrogance and a great entertainer
MMA,removed,youre legitimately one of the worst posters on this subreddit youre always looking to start an argument and be a prick i think youre the one who needs to watch out for all that edge
MMA,removed,i say dillweed by ko as everything alvarez throws at him will go straight over his head
MMA,removed,girl bye
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,ahahahahahah your post history ahahahaha rcringe
MMA,removed,whats up with these fat titty azn girls first tracy lee now her
MMA,removed,goats are anderson silva gsp might mouse aldo are goats too but they will never get that honor from the public these are guys who won fight after fight in convincing fashion while having to show their skills in stand up on the ground and in the clinch they defended their belts time and time again and got their fame from their skills in the octagon not from their antics outside of it conor mcgregor could become a goat its not impossible but he needs to prove himself on the ground and in the clinch he also needs to go on a big defense run to be considered these guys have risked it all over times and have proven themselves each time conor only proved himself once aldo defended the belt for years and wasnt given a shot at lw mcgregor has never defended it and is getting a shot its fabricated
MMA,removed,seems like ur more butthurted than he is
MMA,removed,for a brilliant nerd youre pretty fucking stupid
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,are you
MMA,removed,phew i cant wait for gsp to defend his belt against this paper champion johny hendricks robbie lawler
MMA,removed,if you had a threesome with these chicks your dick would be bleeding
MMA,removed,fucking mma hipsters they were here before mcgregor unlike all us casuals waaaaaaah ð© fuck off
MMA,removed,ive been seing this clowns face everywhere rmma is the place i come to forget about what we have done by electing him please keep him off of her at least
MMA,removed,well he is potus remember the first obama days
MMA,removed,check you privilege cracker
MMA,removed,one is a criminal and the other said mean things stop whining already

MMA,removed,for real cant turn on the tv without seeing this guy maybe because he is the fucking presidentelect of the united states
MMA,removed,maybe he grabs arianny by the pussy because he can do that
MMA,removed,yes based trump great man
MMA,removed,karolina is getting tuned up by joanna in there she just needs to grab her by the pussy
MMA,removed,ive watched zero wwe the only thing that looked staged was conors hold me back bro after his lil tantrum with the chair great work backing up your ridiculous claim with an insult though youll fit in with the rest of the shit posters on here
MMA,removed,no she got investigated because republicans brought charges against her and they failed to convict her because there was no case you have bought right into the lies of people like rudy guiliani chris christie sarah palin many more be aware be educated
MMA,removed,its so easy to point out the jackass that hasnt actually watched jon fight
MMA,removed,hahahahahah are you actually serious like honestly you try to play the racist card hahahaha youre absolutely ridiculous then tonight in the press conference he was like okay lets make a beat boo tiss boo boo boo tss if you dont find that shit cringey on top of all the other cringey shit hes done you are clearly either riding his dick or just plain stupid racism hahah get to fuck you moron
MMA,removed,damn poland produces a lot of beauties

MMA,removed,have a bad week little buddy
MMA,removed,ah i see you dont have eir broadband by any chance failing that getting a vpn is probably your best bet or watch an illegal stream
MMA,removed,this article is so funny because you know this is supposed to be mma and not a fucking talk show nobody should give two fucks about how a fighter talks or if the press conference was entertaining and yet with the rise of conormania now we get indepth analysis of interviews and press conferences people who wouldnt know a jab from a hook now suddenly have qualified opinions about mma based not on the fighting but on the shit fighters say why is the act so important maybe because conor looked like shit in both diaz fights and his fighting skills seem to be going downhill fast anyone downvoting or replying with a defense of conor or any of this bullshit stfu and gtfo good night
MMA,removed,one legit fighter dude you are a clown stop writing to me
MMA,removed,he was controlling his remotecontrolled dildo stuck up his asshole common affairs business as usual
MMA,removed,i feel like im watching an autistic man trying to understand what social skills are
MMA,removed,newbie check yourself he has never cared about contact up to this point or even made a point of saying what he did to after that happened maybe you should pull your head out of your ass and pay more attention
MMA,removed,it is the jewish controlled media of americans trust that is dead their falling revenues have nothing to do with people yearning for sports insights
MMA,removed,if there is literally nothing to back up what you are saying whatsoever and all numbers point to the other direction you should usually shut your fucking mouth all im asking if for people just to acknowledge when they are talking out of their ass
MMA,removed,this was pretty endearing
MMA,removed,thats because you are tired and predictable you fuckin smeglord
MMA,removed,you counted your comment too man i forget how many people on this subreddit fit on the spectrum
MMA,removed,captain jack sparrow i am a bot i have corrected people
MMA,removed,if i want to legally buy the ufc here in the uk i would have to change my internet provider to bt then get a tv package installed which i dont currently have with virgin as i dont watch tv so it would be a waste apart from the bt sport for ufc oh but bt isnt available in my area so i cant legally buy the fights unless i move house to an area that bt is available so i think ill stick to my illegal streams
MMA,removed,dont stream the fights illegally hahaha no chance
MMA,removed,oh fuck off
MMA,removed,how do you figure eddie looks bad conors keyboard warriors out in full effect

MMA,removed,that sucks means im going to have to stream it cant afford any subscriptions
MMA,removed,mate shut the fuck up skinny fat is probably what your ex looks like not chris weidman

MMA,removed,lol posting entirely offtopic to tell me that youve tagged me with such and such digging up posts from hundreds of pages back in my posting history i said maybe you have too much time on your hands now there is no maybe you need to get a lifeor in the very least stay on topic nobody cares who or what you have tagged
MMA,removed,loud noises
MMA,removed,but whats the real cost this kind of shit puts off the genuine fans of the sport and brings in people that are only interested in conor not the sport i dont think hes doing anything positive for the other fighters because he constantly talks them down not just the people he is going to fight and the fans he brings in and its proven by the stats he brags about dont care about the sport in general just him in my opinion thats hurting the sport i just cant imagine loving one particular person you dont know so much if a chess player was throwing this much shit chat would you become an avid chess fan or would you just tune in to watch a dickhead talk shit to me thats the equivalent of whats happening here it seems people are just cheering a troll but i guess thats why donald trump is president the world is allowing itself to be run by trolls
MMA,removed,his beard would rough up his asshole black man beards are scratchy as fuck
MMA,removed,fuck

MMA,removed,i love seeing that twat turn into a stammering child im hoping eddie beats the shit out of him at then he has some sort of mental breakdown and retires from fighting altogether conor his stupid fucking fans dana and the new owners have turned the ufc into a fucking clown show this is now the wwufc
MMA,removed,he was talking about nate fucking casuals
MMA,removed,that doesnt make a lick of sense ive never once seen anyone even suggest such a thing youre just projecting shit
MMA,removed,even more so with conor fans judging by the brigading going on
MMA,removed,itt trump supporters with economics degrees
MMA,removed,lmao so i should pay for other peoples children because of their bad life choices fuck off you beta lol
MMA,removed,thank god his career has nothing to do with talking
MMA,removed,some people have an unshakable drive and do what they have to do to succeed its what separates someone incredibly successful like mcgregor from someone who spends six hours a day arguing with strangers on the internet like yourself

MMA,removed,this thread is fucking hillarious everyone thinks theyre an expert on conors personal life he played video games he quit his job to play call of duty all night because thats what he said in a video where he was promoting the new call of duty game all the while dee was out working to support him reeee reeeeeee twerps who know nothing conor took a gamble backed himself and made something of himself i love all these salty twats desperate to shoot him down and desperate for losers like alvarez to be a good shit talker when hes just a fool it actually gets me hard reading all the shit you desperate clowns spout conor walked all over featherweight exposed that fraud juice head aldo for the pussy and coward that he is and hes going to raise a second gold when he smokes alvarez and theres literally fucking nothing you can do about it except sit there triggered with the rage bursting out onto reddit threads downvoting on your sticky keyboards desperate pathetic but ill enjoy every damn second of it watching your world burn
MMA,removed,id love to see a blackedcom rendition of this

MMA,removed,im in mieshas underwear drawer
MMA,removed,there is a difference between being able to work and not being able to find work at the time the country was being nailed hard by recession and everyone felt shitty because of it the guy obviously had very little options as many people do and instead of staying in a rut he wanted to go do his own thing hey it can easily be said that he only went on the dole because he couldnt stand the thoughts of being a plumber for the rest of his life maybe he should have worked along with training anyone can look at the past with vision and he wanted to at least try to grab hold of something and see where it goes and get a job later to pay it back my dad always sayshe is a tradesman ive been paying taxes through the nose all of my life and i work for myself and what do i get back from the government shitty roads shitty health care more taxes to pay off the governments mistakes and whole lot of debt to go along with it son if you ever get the chance to get money from the government to help make life easier take it because i probably paid it twice over

MMA,removed,fatty
MMA,removed,actually its a pretty weak response to a valid point that cruz last few performances could be bottled and prescribed as a sleep aide how exactly does lol ur fat detracts from that observation the thing is anyone with a followingsoapbox cant really lose because their cuck fanboys eat up everything they say and post lul rekt no matter what its like a comedian vs a heckler the one with the microphone is going to win no matter what just because they have the audience on their side dominic couldve said you know what youre right im going to work on training to fight more aggressively and find finishes and some of you would be reacting like he dickslapped the guys whole family
MMA,removed,good i would also wish a moratorium on threads everytime mcgregor posts anything or responds to anything until an actual fight is announced i am no longer interested in mcgregors antics at staying in the spotlight reminds me too much of trump

MMA,removed,your welcome its good to see other people cant stand him either so much of this sub seems to love him i think its because he seems like a nerd or talks like hes halfway smart so all the neckbeards here think theyre like him or something hes just a dickhead who personally insults people and fights like a bitch best fighter at avoiding the fight
MMA,removed,i would pay good money to crawl through ushanecarwin actual shit
MMA,removed,its not a game dickhead thats how immature you are your only response is that you have to have the last word fuck off
MMA,removed,lmao go watch those fights again because youre either trolling or youre honestly an idiot she didnt just toss davis she caught her with a beautiful combo then threw her down and finished the fight her striking was very clean and brutal against mcmann and her fight with a bethe consisted of precise combos with led to a knockout im not saying that shes an amazing striker but calling her striking sloppy is fucking ignorant and stupid tbh

MMA,removed,i cant believe how stupid you are its an easy cut he also got rocked by dos anjos so not likely he makes the move again dos anjos already called him out for the problem is that the fight makes no money and its not worth it for nate conor fights are obviously worth more money because of all the dinguses that downvoted michael rapaports comedic gold
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,oh ok so just by adding thats just my opinion youre automatically not being rude and nasty admit it youre a douche

MMA,removed,man what the fuck are you talking about so holly was going to win the fight with her suddenly sublime grappling skills this was her best chance to win the fight and she just wasnt the better striker tonight

MMA,removed,isnt he also going through a divorce
MMA,removed,so youre suggesting that rory just up and quit because he had enough and not because lawler had turned his nose into tenderized meat over the course of rounds and making groundless accusations that he was on peds at that wow you just continue to make your ignorance more apparent to me you think rondas loss was a fluke lesnars physique is because he is a freak and not because of decades of ped abuse and now you think rory is on roids jesus crist will you fuck off back to the wwe subreddit already
MMA,removed,piss off ya fuckin drop kick
MMA,removed,sport based around ultimate forms of combat using leverage is illegal lol why even have the cage why not just have a clear plastic fucking wall at that point oh i know why because a cage gives off an aura of excitement draws more retards in
MMA,removed,maybe if you had someone cheat against you essentially get away with all the reward money and had jsut fought cheaters in a row plus have people bombarding your just outrage with stop whining you would say shit like that too but oh wait you have less empathy than a autistic child so you side with little dipshits that are trolling a pro fighter man some people are retards
MMA,removed,what an absolute random fighter to have as your favorite lmaooo
MMA,removed,this guy saw this pic and thought it would make a good quality post on rmma let that sink in guys
MMA,removed,pro wrestling yes they are professionals their profession is entertainment i hope you enjoyed your english lesson retard
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my page then you peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,makes me think of that bondage porn where the actress is literally beating the shit out of the balls with her fist watching once was enough to make me cringe for all eternity
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,goddamn i remember that time you couldnt enter a single thread without seeing hughied sucking off conor
MMA,removed,as an american i agree on top of that everyone assumes nfl players would dominate any sport they choose to enter but what makes them elite football players it would hurt their fighting ability cardio the average nfl play is seconds nfl players train for that there is a reason you see football players on the sidelines with oxygen masks on their face their cardio is terrible if they decide to work on their cardio then that would take away from their explosiveness which everyone loves to point to as evidence that theyd be elite fighters chin like you said chin is a big one as well as taking a punch lebron james had to be carried to the locker room because he had a cramp he got hard fouled during game and could barely stand up big and athletic doesnt equate to toughness mental toughness being able to take a punch is wonderful but being able to starve yourself for a week cutting lbs of water weight going hard for minutes while your lungs are on fire no standing around nothing that takes a different kind of toughness which isnt for everyone
MMA,removed,i love youtube comments hours ago edited you aint getting the title cause you aint beating joanna and when the day comes when a young girl finally beats joanna well guess what you aint beating that young girl either just be cute and sexy so omar can jack off to youï»¿

MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my page then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,where are you connor fan boys now are you gonna argue with the pros the people in this video have actually fought at the highest level for decades who knows more you or them
MMA,removed,stfu and stop commenting on something you know nothing about conor made it less than rounds in a round fight he got waffle stomped in the round after gassing he didnt even make it half way before gassing due to losing boxing exchanges with a better and more skilled boxer so what if it looked like conor was doing slightly better at round he wasnt actually based on significant strikes he had to use everything he had to even hang like that until round where he got stomped out if you are ahead at start of a foot race because you are sprinting your ass off but unconscious on the side of the road at the first quarter mile mark of a mile race were you winning
MMA,removed,i see no reason why they cant allow each fighter say sponsors they keep the reebok shorts and other clothing shoes underwear shirts and hats if you like however the fighter still gets to wear a noncompetitive sponsored hat and shirt to the ring and they should be able to add one sponsor to their shorts sponsor must provide a patch with set dimensions then reebok can apply it to the shorts that way you still get a cleaned up uniform except each fighter can make extra money with an extra sponsors if a fighter cant get sponsors he still gets his reebok check
MMA,removed,yep kinda like deadlifting or squatting with a belt sure it helps but that belt masks thing you should work on core strength is vital for a straight back you arent making it stronger while wearing a belt
MMA,removed,fuck off manlet
MMA,removed,hey bobs bitch tits can you stop commenting all over this subreddit you come off as dumb as mark hunt

MMA,removed,if this gets removed rmmacirclejerk i think im gonna try to reboot it i understand rmma is being more closely moderated and im down for that its a clear news aggregate and character limit and i love the general discussion thread but a place where any and everything that has some semblance or relation to mma goes and stays and we can talk about it and joke about random shit that only people that talk about mma online would get thats a bit of a dream its like ronepiececirclejerk
MMA,removed,yell ok nobody was talking to you fuck off
MMA,removed,i honestly hope bisping ends him within the first two minutes so we can get this stupid shit over and done with good fucking riddance
MMA,removed,surprise you have a hendo flair lmao beat it you freak
MMA,removed,dude fuck off you made it seem like ufc wouldnt let them fight for the title because somehow that has anything to do with hendobisping hendo isnt going to have trouble making weight and never fight in that weight class again hes retiring leaving the title vacant has no lasting effect they just will have another title match to crown a new champion
MMA,removed,idk suicide seems like the only option

MMA,removed,it depends for me if it was a tainted supplement who else is jones going to fight besides dc i think this process will get drawn out long enough for rumble and dc to fight then when jones gets back he gets the shot if it was the supplement issue or another thing that points to jones innocence in reality even in that scenario there is a huge chance jones fucks up before then but a man can dream

MMA,removed,if you translate his portuguese in the most triggerseeking way possible he was joking saying that jds has a crush on him and that while he has no problem with gay people hes married in reference to jds calling him out and talking about him all the time while thats not really clever it also doesnt come off as homophobic in any way unless simply referring to homosexuals is considered homophobic now

MMA,removed,reddit doctor over here whered you get your phd from diagnosing people on reddit was it the rama
MMA,removed,khabib fans are disgusting
MMA,removed,lol okay buddy which is more likely aldo was injured and couldnt fight he healed up and then fought on the next available date aldo was scared of conor and faked an injury but then fought him anyways if aldos goal was to get a conor pay day why the fuck did he fake an injury to cowardly run away your own delusional logic doesnt follow man do the tiniest bit of research on the subject forget your massive raging hate boner for aldo for five seconds and consider the facts it might help if you got off conors balls for a few minutes as well im done trying to argue this all of the stuff you are saying is false common knowledge false everyone who knows anything about mma and has done any sort of unbiased thinking or research knows it theres no point in trying to cure your mental illness over the internet

MMA,removed,gimme yer belt
MMA,removed,amazing not a word about the dagestani assailants being muslims as usual no islam here nothing to do with islam no muslims involved

MMA,removed,this is a completely unacceptable response there is a reddit prohibition against breaking rules and the approved users are exempt from that structure you have personally expressed frustration that people dont understand that now you are saying thats the lack of reports of spamming for something exempt from spamming rules is a sign there is no problem the moderation team has an entirely misplaced set of concerns over granting approved user status and is so muttled about the role of approved users in the community that it ends up saying nonsensical things when users express legitimate concerns
MMA,removed,say that to his face pussy

MMA,removed,its not in all caps the name was taken so i had to opt to using a zero in place of an o the caps are to keep the character heights similar but seriously do you have a learning disability because your post was one of the dumber ones ive read on here and thats saying something i dont want to clown on some kid or someone with a learning disability youre suggesting that im being judgmental about fighters when youre the one arguing that theyre animals and need to have people in the cage to physically restrain them boxing has been around way longer and has way more concussions than mma do you see them needing giant refs you seem to suggest that you fight yourself if so do you fly into rages when you get brain damaged holy shit
MMA,removed,manlet with a journalism degree criticising someone with the testicular fortitute to actually get in the cage and do his best righto
MMA,removed,no asshole you make it sound like all of glendale is filled with dipshits like edmond and the majority of people who infest this board already believe that anyway so you cosign that bullshit because you want to fucking fit in with these dweebs when anyone who lives in glendale knows the vast majority of armenians are nothing like that piece of shit edmond then in addition to that you use a term you know is a racial slur towards armenians the fuck is wrong with you kid
MMA,removed,exactly the delusion of this guy is only matched by the unwillingness of the people here not to see it
MMA,removed,punk did get mauled is a white belt and delusional for believing he could have a successful career in the ufc at the age of and youre comparing aldo and glovers flash ko losses to punk straight getting out classed how about starting with aldo being undefeated since wec and glover going rounds with jones lol why should cm punk instantly have our respect gtfo wwe fanboy
MMA,removed,stfu ronda
MMA,removed,god this is so fucking ridiculous you think this was honestly werdums train of thought oh i got knocked the fuck out by doing this in my last fight but lets not adjust anything because my next opponent has less of a chance of doing that never mind the fact that ill probably never get a title shot again if i get kod in the same way never mind my long term health brown sucks lol xd so lets expose my chindo you realise how ridiculous you sound get werdums nuts out of your mouth maybe if you had any knowledge of boxing whatsoever you wouldnt be making such retarded comments
MMA,removed,so he is rawdogging that disgusting hippo while his career goes to shit training with tarderyan not the wisest move

MMA,removed,you either cant read or are severely retarded were not talking about trained athlete vs trained athlete no fucking shit a male ufc fighter would crush a female ufc fighter were talking about an untrained large male vs ronda rousey do you think serena williams would get destroyed by someone who has no clue how to play tennis no chance no way someone bigger than rousey stands a chance in a fight just cause hes big and fit
MMA,removed,youre an idiot if you think you can step into the highest of the sport is it your dream to become a professional fighter is this your new career cause theres an actual path he couldve taken to do that are you going to really claim cm punk is now a professional level fighter after seeing that but he would have been a fool to turn that deal down right again is your goal money or to actually become a pro fighter no theyre not mutually exclusive but when your independently wealthy it would have been even more commendable if he turned down the offer
MMA,removed,not true your mom likes a hot load on the chest every once in a while and im happy to take her up on it
MMA,removed,im born and raised canadian i dont walk around saying im irish german well let me tell you something my krautmick friend im gonna make so much trouble for you you won t know what hit you

MMA,removed,i mean the only footage of him in competition is him knocking someone out and theyre clearly in a gymnasium but yeah whatever you say random dickhead
MMA,removed,diaz incoherent screaming was awesome why nothing he said made any sense as usual its the same stupid shit he always says at one point he says where are you now conor mcgregor when he is preparing to fight nate schaub is at least knowledgable about the sport most of what he says about mma i agree on but yeah having some fat idiot screaming is awesome instead of a former ufc fighter lmao
MMA,removed,the two hosts of this show are such cucks
MMA,removed,no they arent related hes just her coach and good friend and she is a very clever and great mother also and of course a heart of gold x
MMA,removed,fuck you pussy you havent accomplished nearly as much shit as i have in my life
MMA,removed,depends on the person and on the school different lineages seem to have different philosophies about when you should receive each belt a lot of the schools with rickson lineage are known for average blue belt time of years where as like firas zahabi talks about going off helios definition of a blue belt being able to consistently beat bigger stronger but untrained opponents and says that the average blue belt who comes to class frequently at tristar a world class mma gym is about months as you progress into higher belt levels it will normally start to average out between schools more but there are still some lineages that take a notoriously long time to get belt rank within for example the school i train at tends to promote quite slowly and we have a year white belt who sometimes teaches the fundamentals class hes an absolute beast and since we dont do stripes for white belts he might appear to an outsider as a no stripe white belt but ive seen him tap more blues than i can count and ive seen him have fairly even rolls with some purples so belt rank can be deceiving especially if the person is primarily a no gi grappler which happens to be the case for my year no stripe white training partner
MMA,removed,i seriously had no idea what i had just seen until i watched the replay and i train bjjsubmission wrestling it still doesnt make total sense to me ive reconciled it as high level judomagic

MMA,removed,as far as dropping the sample and producing another one i think its a nonissue if anything having less fluid in his body makes it more likely for something to show up i dont think there is going to be a huge difference between samples taken minutes apart thats not true like the opposite of how it works basically the body produce a fixed number of doping residual in time and amount so if you drink alot of water and piss alot and trash first pee after a while you will piss clean water almost im more inclined to believe the cops were trying to shake down the sample collector for a bribe and it got out of hand but they called the whole mess before the sample was taken if what you said were true they would have allowed the sample first and then asked for a bribe which they didnt they wanted no sample taken
MMA,removed,better torrent it if youre gonna steal it its of far better quality
MMA,removed,that doent make any sense if what you said was true aldo could have let the inspector bring his sample along even in jail which they didnt let him do the sample was trashed plus they were people of aldo team so really they would only help him not the opposite
MMA,removed,no it would the same maybe even worse from me why you people assume something like that it baffles me
MMA,removed,hmmm not sure chael is telling one of his stories there but anyway he could have easily called the central commission and asked them hey there is a guy here called xxxx did you sent him to random test me can you talk to him alittle and confirm and thats it to confirm it was a real thing
MMA,removed,the gracie family are the best in bjj are you arguing that
MMA,removed,you aldo fans so scared its unbelivable you reacting so bad means you think nate gonna destroy aldo which is funny
MMA,removed,you think aldo doesnt stand a chance dont you
MMA,removed,it didnt make sense with conor either but it was one of the most entertaining and fun fight of the whole ufc history
MMA,removed,the concept that you aldo fans are so against him fighting nate is not something i did create and i didnt expect that i didnt expect that aldo fans want him to have easy fights want him to win by any means necessary you are the kind of guys that dont mind your pref fighter doping up if that makes him win i would never condone that
MMA,removed,weird since when conor is the topic you say or is the same that conor fighting at is no disadvantage but if it is for your man jose you are totally against it also you are forgetting it was jose that wanted to go up to at one time so him and nate could and could have been a fight but you are right at nobody want to see their fight if even you aldo fans think aldo is too weak for that figure the others

MMA,removed,these guys promise to have a free stream available
MMA,removed,im not gay or anything hut he is kinda handsome perry
MMA,removed,he is going for the belt not for the specific fighter hand picking is meant as avoiding certain fighters while picking the easiest ones how can you accuse mcgregor of that when he had to fight aldo and he pulled out he accepted to fight any fighter that would come in mendes at the time he even did it again later with the rda fight in short notice he accepted a fight basically vs anyone at any weight anyone that later became nate diaz at almost higher weight classes lbs
MMA,removed,i just stated facts i dont hate aldo at all if you facts about mcgregor you wanted to share i would be most interested to hear them
MMA,removed,if conor were to duck aldo his fans me included would be the first to outrage about it problem is i dont see it that way at the moment first aldo made conor go through hell with all his late pull outs and late timing to make a fight what if he pull out again last minute on the rematch fighting him is not the safest move businessside second conor has moved up to and he is probably not coming back so the only issue would be the belt given that ufc is gonna make conor drop his belt after the next fight doesnt seem a big deal to me theyufc need the publicity of belts champion third aldo had never fought so often when he was champ but now he is willing to fight months after his last fight uhm finally not even a year has passed since aldomcgregor if we wanted fair the rematch should happen after the same has passed
MMA,removed,for women that take steroids does the effects last forever because in the men if you take steroids you gain mass immediately but if you stop taking steroids you lost that mass as easily kinda wonder what change for women the problem of men is the testicles production reduced but women dont have that disadvantage
MMA,removed,conor is absolute trash and you are a fox noob and no nothing about high level mma ur sad

MMA,removed,michael j fox on camera was flinching like mother fucker
MMA,removed,usually thats when i get harder
MMA,removed,reddit mma streams
MMA,removed,untrue yes if you bulk past your natty limit youll deflate back down to that limit if you dont go to ubereem levels you can retain much of your gains i guess what you say is true but its hardly the case people take steroids only and i say only after they cant make progress in the gym without so basically when they already got to their limit or close
MMA,removed,yeah it seems like a lot of his wins were like that
MMA,removed,uhhh autism alert your comment reeks of tribal bandanna sweat
MMA,removed,i would like them both too but aldo has some characteristics i dont like he could have been using ped in the past because brazil is a place with easy access to pedsbrazil is a corrupted place and most brazilian fighters have been caught up already using and because of the incident with the nsac inspector if that was true that he used in the past his accomplishments would become null to me some people dont care about the doping thing but i do i would never support a cheat fighter even worse a cheat that got away aldo also has way too much of an ego thinks he has nothing left to prove and whines too much about anything and everything and doesnt back it up

MMA,removed,this is the best tldr i could make reduced by im a bot the ufc has enlisted an unlikely animated duo in its quest to turn ufc payperview event into its most popular ever king of the hank hill and george liquor from the ren stimpy show intrigued white began researching the demoadult swim has been no among to for the past decade and white said a large portion of that male audience is africanamericanand realized it was an ideal fit for ufc quotthe way the payperview market works for us we give them a spot and then they circulate it through all the cable channels but our spots are never on adult swimquot said white the spots took more than a year to create due to the red tape required to clear the rights to use hank hill and george liquor and getting adult swim on board version tldrs so far pms and comment replies are read by the bot admin constructive feedback is welcome top keywords

MMA,removed,you literally said that jones not cheating is a fact not an opinion this shows me you dont understand what facts and opinions are let me explain to you there are things called rules and these are to be interpreted therefore the interpretation of these rules is called an opinion also actual experts have gone on record and says he cheats all the time basically you need to shut the fuck up and realize youre of below average intelligence have a nice day loser
MMA,removed,your country is irrelevant
MMA,removed,go to a fucking gym you donk
MMA,removed,all because vpns use common standards like and openvpn but not all are good of course theres no saying which one is good most people dont have frames of reference many vpn services offer trials so try them out yourself if you are money conscious and if you dont want a vpn for netflix for example then you could go by the free vpn route httpwwwvpngateneten so far you are able to buy a ppv with a vpn for a low price and then just switch to your own connection that way you dont have any problems with internet speeds a problem with the free vpns at that point you are still gonna have to deal with and fox broadcasts and its illegal in the end too you might as well just pirate a stream if youre a cordcutter then youre using kodi already i assume theres many plugins that offer live sports tv every now and then theres someone who offers access to his private streams for a small sum
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off then u piece of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt ilke u telling me about being butthurt who the fuck are u take your advice and get the fuck out of here

MMA,removed,so basically you can see that he is a dumb shallow cocky asshole but you have a crush on him so he must be different off camera lmao youll figure it out luke is a real douche bag you can see it on his face classic narcissist if you doubt me watch all of his interviews and notice how he never laughs at jokes about himself or jokes that could be about him quit worshiping celebrities

MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,steroids cheaters poop chute cheaters pussy boi case closed your loss
MMA,removed,bellator offered more than the ufc felt rory was worth simple as that no need to go full retard with conspiracy theories
MMA,removed,that is the road they chose to follow though fighters most of them rely on making it to a belt so they can earn that super cash some rare fighters decide to build their name and brand before signing with the ufc or another promotion as to get a better contracts because they are known and will bring in more butts to seats as a promotion the ufc and any other loves this this is what it is its promotion no name fighters no matter how hard they work in the gym have only done themselves a disservice in this new era by relying on their work ethic to get paid thats not how it works they need to focus on their brand and making it sellable take king mo for example he built his brand and gets better contracts than comparable fighters because he is a name that in return brings in cash for his employers if every no name fighter making their debut got paid per fight there would be no reason to fight for the win would there we would see people giving up and tapping very early we cant have or want this as real mma fans punk brings awareness to the sport where other no name fighters who complain dont because nobody gives a fuck about them why people dont care about them is that fighters personal problem whether its because they dont fight how the fans want to pay to see or whether they didnt train hard enough to make it to the higher paying levels of mma etc etc but it is on those fighters nobody is stealing anything from them they werent getting paid anyways how does punk steal a spot from somebody who never had it or doesnt currently hold it lol
MMA,removed,you got a remember theres over people in the sub now many of them are morons that are ride or die with dumb fucks like jones and mcgregor some of us are oldschool dudes who like mma as a sport but i think we are an endangered species

MMA,removed,saved by the bell lol can you even breath with nates nuts that far down your throat
MMA,removed,your douchey wait am i misremembering i remember nate getting knocked down not knocked out literally no one said nate got knocked out
MMA,removed,nevermind the fact that hes been retired for years and hes a fucking engineer yeah theres no fucking way he could lose any muscle mass in years of inactivity working a desk job i understand steroid accusations thrown at fighters lately but were talking about a dude whose hands are so big they had to make custom gloves for him in order for him to be able to fight hes not a normal dude beyond that carwin retired what years before usada even became a thing fuck off with your accusations honestly the dude is years old and you expected to stay in fighting shape during a year retirement what the fuck goes on in your guys head
MMA,removed,an it with a dick have they been wrong yet
MMA,removed,i certainly would advocate for permanent bans for men its ridiculous that people still get away with it today like brock but men in the ufc already have a lot of testosterone im not a doctor but i doubt mens bone density would permanently increase with such drastic percanteges as women so yea fuck off ye twat
MMA,removed,and you gave him hours of slave labor before he could make you money again dip shit
MMA,removed,you shut your fucking mouth
MMA,removed,okay mr douchebag canadian have fun with your shitty card

MMA,removed,what hunt and people on his side are upset about is the lack of recourse if you fail a test in the olympics you get stripped of your win medals potentially past medals and you get suspended then your own governing body could fine you ban you etc theres clearly none of that here what the fucking hell are you talking about youre purposely distorting the truth the punishments for cheating in the ufc are the same as as the olympics a fine and a ban brock will get both mark hunt is crying because he thinks the fine should go to him he wants a cut of brocks purse and thats ridiculous no other sport in the world works like that

MMA,removed,just looking at a video of rockhold throwing one that seems about right but it looks like two mini pivots before you throw the question mark kick i think ive seen dodson or another flyweight fighter throw one but it didnt seem as pretty since he wasnt as long as rockhold lol it looks a little different to me when he practices it but the one he uses against bisping in the end of this video has him turn his heel so it faces forward and he does a little skip with it as well
MMA,removed,breaking and entering lol anthony johnson fucking attacked and assaulted a defenseless girl youre an asshole and a piece of shit human being forever if you do something like that and imo if youre still a fan him than fuck you too but fuck platinum for making a dumb harmless mistake years ago what an unforgivable dickhead

MMA,removed,you stupid piece of fuck should always start sentences with i think because you never know when you might show just how fucking stupid you are like this i think it trains your heartliterally or cardiovascular system imagine when you are fighting you arent just using your arms or legs so this basically increases overall ability helps you be able to push more out of yourself when necessary
MMA,removed,hey shit for brain ive got this puzzle for you how do you any fucking thing about his workouts by watching this second video are you really like really really this stupid chad

MMA,removed,someone else brought up conor stop it pussy lol
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up nate at like somehow he has better stamina when he starves himself that was just an extremely highpaced fight so if you say conor doesnt have good cardio then at the same time you need to say nate doesnt either because he got tired too
MMA,removed,well arent you a little bitch
MMA,removed,wanting to fuck her aside has she any background in any art if so great look forward to her debut we have the internet we dont need to jack off to female fighters i want to see fighters who are actually good

MMA,removed,running for president for instance
MMA,removed,hahahahahahahahahahaha you could clone bisping and have weidman fight him two times in a night and the bispings would still lose
MMA,removed,hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahhaa a shot against weidman are you joking in what possible way could bisping beat chris granite chin weidman is he going to mount and savage him like rockhold did err no weidman is a very high level black belt who would toy with bisping on the ground is he going to knock him out on the feet err no weidman eats the shot that put luke down for breakfast theres actually no possible way for bisping to beat weidman maybe he can outlast him in a cardio battle thats his best shot and that gives him a fuck all chance
MMA,removed,shut your bitch ass up
MMA,removed,i want the karate hottie to beat that ass
MMA,removed,im saying that because the story isnt about what he did in the hotel room or what you would have done differently personally i dont need all the fighters on the ufc roster to succumb to my idea of common sense or respect i simply want to be entertained and see the fighters make good money ufc decides what to do in your example based on its company policy so get off your high horse dipshit i swear some people here judge fighters for every single thing theyve done even when its off topic
MMA,removed,are you
MMA,removed,hope they decide to fight naked
MMA,removed,no its not the fuck is this nonsense its probably unsportsmanlike and grounds for suspension but its not illegal the fuck is that

MMA,removed,i bet you got a bunch of ass posts to rmmababes
MMA,removed,i am not even kidding i head the name dave sholler first time in this thread virtually literally identical
MMA,removed,long term value vs short term
MMA,removed,yeah i said as much aldo is also a huge fw most of conors career fights are at fw and he has never once missed the cut even making the championship weight when he didnt need to conor is as much a fw as anyone and diaz and eddie call it the little boy belt for the same reason any fighter in their situation would its an easy and obvious half criticism of him conor is significantly smaller than eddie and nate because he is a big fw but a titchy lw honestly this is the dumbest criticism of conor ever
MMA,removed,paige shines in the clinch and top position on the ground but her spacing is really shitty if you look at her striking as much as everyone was sucking her clit over that flashy head kick tko in her last performance if you actually watch the fight it was a lucky shot in all reality she threw like flashy kicks from the next fucking county statistically she was bound to land at least one and was lucky it was enough to do the job because rawlings was fucking her up you saw it before when she fought rose she was jabbing out in space presenting no threat because she didnt seem to actually know how to work her way in just throwing shots and hoping her opponent runs into them
MMA,removed,youre fucking stupid no offense
MMA,removed,you shut your whore mouth
MMA,removed,they do their fighters they pay their fighters more than every other mma organization combined
MMA,removed,thanks for your valuable contribution to the conversation go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,take the water out and the leprechaun will appear
MMA,removed,you have no idea what youre talking about and are simply talking out of your ass shut the fuck up idiot
MMA,removed,that doesnt matter you fucking idiot even if it did hold the weight you think it does he wouldnt be stupid enough to throw it in the exact same way he mentioned if he switches it up then thats that how would you prove he didnt just succumb to exhaustionmental break etc you cant stop being an imbecile
MMA,removed,bet you would like conor to break your asshole into pieces
MMA,removed,i guess he plowed chandella powell tons of times then
MMA,removed,lol if the margin of error is percent then why even bother having the test then dickhead
MMA,removed,i dont want to lick any butt it was simpler times back then
MMA,removed,dis
MMA,removed,how about the most recent gem of conor having a child on the way started because dana said he had a big announcement after his next fight this sub basically pulled that rumour out of its ass and its being taken seriously now

MMA,removed,fuck off douche nozzle
MMA,removed,fuck you guy
MMA,removed,rough to watch these downsyndrom tmz reporters with less social skills then a pen
MMA,removed,yes its a percentage this sub is just full of ignorant teens
MMA,removed,i never said i didnt understand why dana has connors dick in his mouth i totally get that money is more important than the integrity of the sport doesnt mean i have to like it or be a connor fanboy like the rest of rmma
MMA,removed,streams are not illegal to watch
MMA,removed,i hear akhmat fight club has a wonderful youth program
MMA,removed,guess that makes him a bad person right stfu
MMA,removed,for a water bottle video shows him throwing multiple objects into a packed crowed including a can youre a minimizer liar and moron based on your comment
MMA,removed,seriously today i went to my dentist whos also a woman but anyway thats not the point i had to deal with her receptionist said receptionist is hot but she always has a resting bitch face with her nose in the air she always appears stuck up i mean smile ffs i notice this with attractive women they always seem in bad moods and stuck up maybe because i behave beta around women but i dont know i just always like to smile and be friendly with everyone so maybe they view it as weakness but i dont have time for all that bs of having alpha frame why cant attractive girls be friendly and smile for once its like theyre all pms and stuck up give me a smile baby why angry face presented without comment
MMA,removed,yeah mil is so much more money than conor makes dipshit
MMA,removed,top top
MMA,removed,youre the idiotic asshole here
MMA,removed,you have no idea says the guy speaking in meaningless generalities and throwing out but they have to pay other staff too as a counterargument stfu
MMA,removed,honestly i looked the fuckboy manbun he was rocking in the poirier fight it was a good look for him
MMA,removed,lmao delusional and retarded god bless your soul

MMA,removed,thats what you get for being a dumb asshole
MMA,removed,this belongs in the general discussion sticky
MMA,removed,wow youre really hacking the system bro lol shut the fuck up already
MMA,removed,ive watched every ufc card since most of the tuf seasons and gone back and watched all the cards as well ive also watched every pride event every post strikeforce card and a good chunk of wsof and precoker bellator cards i want to see conoralvarez much more than an aldo rematch conor has had the belt less than a year and aldo has had win since getting knocked out in seconds aldo should be fighting holloway and the winner of that fight should fight conor next if conor avoids the aldoholloway winner then i can see an argument for people being pissed off but until that point sit down and shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,little boy youre a fucking asshole incapable of even considering opposing points of view worst type of mma fan there is
MMA,removed,guilty as charged
MMA,removed,ever heard of hyperbole look it up you insufferable dipshit
MMA,removed,usada year around testing came days after the fight they already improved their testing with jeff novitzy in the beginning of nice try but you must have rode the short bus to school
MMA,removed,is it raciat that this is the first thing i was reminded of
MMA,removed,pee in her butt
MMA,removed,this mentality is only applied selectively everyone complains about fighter pay when someone they like is getting shorted they blame it on the ufc and say its their job to promote their fighters better but when someone they hate like the two new champs that just scored first round kos of this subs darlings starts trying to get a piece of the action its disgraceful because they havent earned it as if its so easy to just go out and talk some shit and sell hundreds of thousands of ppvs in a niche sport without any significant backing from your company i think i read that of the money the ufc makes makes it back to the fighters and theyre i mean the fighters everyone is hating on right now not the guys who do things to deserve big money fights like you know finish championship fights in the first round the ones who are getting the hate if youre gonna be a douchebag at least be fucking consistent
MMA,removed,stfu
MMA,removed,new
MMA,removed,browne was a grade a bitch about it especially when he later intimidated a reporter after those eye rapes he gave out i dont get it browne is repeatedly disrespectful to everyone except arlovski but the moment someone disrespects him he grows panties just to tie them in a knot and get his bitch on
MMA,removed,shit up idiot u dont know shit wats the point if testing wen there isnt really any harsh penalties years ban is bullshit if the guy cheating had killed his oponent would u still think years was a good enough penalty your a moron shut your mouth dummy they should lose all the money be banned for life and go criminal court
MMA,removed,he was taking private classes few times its nothing he has like months of training combined if i was training boxing when i was for few weeks then quit and decided to start an mma career at it would be dishonest to say that i have years of boxing experience
MMA,removed,the boy better have some girth or shes bouncing luke rockhold probably snorts cocaine off demi lovatos herpes infested asshole
MMA,removed,lol yeah man every time i chill with her shes such a bitch
MMA,removed,httpiimgurcomzzaqkunjpg
MMA,removed,you got it bro
MMA,removed,for the good of the sub you need to be stocktonshamrock slapped let me just header this with the fact that im not a fan of unicecoldbud and i never have been now lets be honest with ourselves for the good of the subreddit you should be slapped the fuck up before you post again youre making a career out of shit posting im proud of unicecoldbud for having the bollex to post such shit but sometime soon he needs to be slapped back into reality
MMA,removed,probably a lot of assholes tagging chael and ruining the moment
MMA,removed,points after minutes thats got to be a record even for rmma im actually kind of excited to see how many downvotes this can get from you cum guzzling rent boys
MMA,removed,youre so obviously a troll that noone will argue with you try harder to make it less obvious
MMA,removed,yeah im not into the rest of bethes look but
MMA,removed,this is a perfect example of regulating bodies fucking shit up and making people not want to do business in states
MMA,removed,well that is a foregone conclusion but tons of people have fought on steroids without looking like a female gorilla with pms like that
MMA,removed,mcgregor makes you salty
MMA,removed,yep youre an idiot lol
MMA,removed,im not saying its a problem its how things work and why your idea is stupid youre either a troll or an idiot either way im done with this nonsense
MMA,removed,yes youre the adult here smh

MMA,removed,no but i want a proper argument you pussy
MMA,removed,what a loser
MMA,removed,youre pretty pathetic bro youre gonna say i am too but i just want you to know that you are
MMA,removed,the vigor with which i jerk off
MMA,removed,i think you answered your own question he can possibly achieve his belt goal with fight instead of every fight brings a chance of losing better to fight to keep the belt and fight at than to have to chance a year or set back with a loss in either division
MMA,removed,redditor for years started posting to rmma days after got ourselves a butt hurt nut hugger here
MMA,removed,what did it say

MMA,removed,hey there remember calling me clueless last week for saying brock lesnar was exempt from being tested for steroids well fuck you motherfucker turns out that queer cunt was juiced up check this out jam this up your ass you clueless cunt along with lesnars dirty needles
MMA,removed,mountain jew
MMA,removed,lmfao wwe fanboys casuals brock didnt do that to mark hunt at allthe man was just holding him down trying not to do anything that would risk hunt getting back up he was using his roided out sizestrength on hunt
MMA,removed,httpiimgurcomgkzlqlugifv
MMA,removed,the discourse here is rough and the circle jerk is furious in these parts it almost feels like itnis more difficult to get a decent mma conversation here without someone trying very hard to prove that you are a casual and they know more than you also everybody trains even if they dont the downvote brigade will come if you dont agree with the opinion of the moment and then the guy they all swore was the second coming will have a bad night and everyone knew he was shit all along fuck ronda pettis never was good travis browne beat his wife silva juiced his entire career jon jones never beat anyone of consequence and all these motherfuckers have been nate diaz fans since he was in grade school just bleed fuck me fuck you fuck everyone dana white is the antichrist
MMA,removed,vinny fagalhaes
MMA,removed,nah theyre criminals and should be erased it would help over populations as well lets face it there isnt a single person that streams illegally that does anything of value on the planet
MMA,removed,white privilege
MMA,removed,inferences as to why they existed are just that inferences estrogen blockers can be used outside of coming down from a doping cycle your armchair intellectual approach is very brave im sure your parents are very proud mr intellectual scientist
MMA,removed,i too listened to the chael sonnen podcast on jre congrats enlightened one dont get it twisted rumble wouldve gotten absolutely murked by jones
MMA,removed,who gives a fatty tit fuck
MMA,removed,cause it isnt a sport and im sooo fucking happy will now have to stfu about the wwe wellness program as if it isnt some stupid wrestling storyline prop fuck wrestling
MMA,removed,oh fuck off with this give him easy fights shit if he feels he is the best in the world he should be able to fight the best
MMA,removed,mouth breathers and overweight man children
MMA,removed,i like the kosher version mountain jew
MMA,removed,its pronounced jew
MMA,removed,its seen as a painkiller going into a fight while you dont feel pain is a benefit
MMA,removed,he popped before usada came into play
MMA,removed,lance armstrong was an absolute asshole that destroyed careers and lives with his lies brock hasnt
MMA,removed,hey people didnt think jones could have been juicing until after he popped so dont be a retard and count out every scenario
MMA,removed,im gonna test you here in a minute bub
MMA,removed,im gonna slap you and your mama buddy and then make you choke on some exotic bat meat
MMA,removed,the puzzle will be pieced together after i help you make sense of my fists mister
MMA,removed,anderson silva is an incredible wrestler too but dc fucked his asshole because of the size difference
MMA,removed,just an idiot
MMA,removed,why would beat by fans matter dude is the best fighter in the world with or without drugs rich and famous losers sitting behind computers dont matter
MMA,removed,its medically prescribed as a painkiller also its ironic how stoners are the first to champion the benefits of marijuana how it relieves pain opiates are a illegal to take anxiety xanax is illegal to take helps focus adderall is illegal to take etc but when its brought up in regards to nick diaz they seem to forget all about those benefits
MMA,removed,in america youre guilty when proven black
MMA,removed,nice already know where to stream that channel in hd no bullshit russian illegal stream for me
MMA,removed,anyone got any streams for it their website doesnt work in my region
MMA,removed,ok pot is prescribed as a painkiller by doctors its also prescribed to help anxiety xanax and opiates are also banned tell me how isnt marijuana a pain reliever are you ignoring modern medicine that labels it as such
MMA,removed,who else thinks this is is a shitpost
MMA,removed,i think youre discounting the benefits of marijuana to try and prove your point obviously its not as powerful as vicodin but it is a legitimate pain reliever that will benefit a fighter yes youll still feel a punch but its still going to take away some of the sting walking around on a leg thats been brutalized by leg kicks will be more painful sober than if that fighter was high
MMA,removed,glad he is marrying a white girl she smart enough not to get with no white boi
MMA,removed,fess up to what the person asked why marijuana is banned i said its prescribed as a painkiller when i said dont feel pain you knew exactly what i meant unless youre on the spectrum and take everything literal than i apologize for confusing you there are very few things that will remove all pain dont feel pain was obviously implied to mean its not going to hurt as much as if you were sober
MMA,removed,haha fuck off
MMA,removed,probably because holly fought the imma eye poke you fight she also after said we hid all my real talent so when we fight for the title i can show the butterfly that i really am
MMA,removed,top comment that fingers prob bigger than lesnars cock kind of annoys me because lesnars massive fucking bulge was so big in that fight it was distracting every time he was bending over and the camera was looking at it ass it httpsiimgurcomloarktejpg seminsfw
MMA,removed,best friend is a girl lol what a poof
MMA,removed,rmmastreams
MMA,removed,if you have an adblocker and arent concerned about hd will have a live stream
MMA,removed,ikr she is not the champion anymore couldnt defend the title why do i still need to see her roided clit on reddit still
MMA,removed,pm me if you find a stream
MMA,removed,a bunch of angry nerds
MMA,removed,you clearly are uneducated on every single fighter yet you downplay who they are fuck off either educate yourself or dont spread you bias opinion
MMA,removed,you dont come across as smart work on that
MMA,removed,you seem dumb
MMA,removed,i dont think you can buy it i would just look for a spike tv stream somewhere that character rule is extremely stupid
MMA,removed,how does a diaz reference make them haters youre just a diaz hater mcgregor nuthugger
MMA,removed,easy very easy not sure what you want me to tell you im giving my opinion and my opinion was that i wished he did a more calculated job of insulting lesnar besides asking for money and this fb post you say we cant say anything unless we go through it and thats never going to happen just seemed like a cheap way to end the conversation so i responded like a dick
MMA,removed,exactly i love all the little kiddies that watch ufc nonstop but jump at every chance to call them greedy dictators people choose to fight theyre not forced to
MMA,removed,oh wow you fucking think you should open up a gym youll be the next zahabi i bet
MMA,removed,the man with the username pmmeyourpsncodes is giving people shit on the internet you absolute glue eater
MMA,removed,you are fucking stupid
MMA,removed,beat it nerd were here to see fights and if steroids are what it takes to make those fights happen so be it
MMA,removed,why dont you get off his dick then its real easy to not listenreadwatch shit you dont like
MMA,removed,well mvp just got a great jumping knee ko that was fantastic but i cant see him succeeding in the ufc
MMA,removed,fuck off we always have to get shitty ufc cards because the ufc wont do a tape delay or anything so finally we getting some love
MMA,removed,im not pathetic enough to go through your comment history nor do i fucking care what you say on completely different subjects that are irrelevant to what we are talking about now i love you pathetic weak fucks that need to dig for ammo lol
MMA,removed,oh look a summer reddit kid who doesnt even know what communism means right because you have to be a communist to think a crowd pleasing ko artist like hunt should be compensated fairly for fighting an overrated cheater whos jacked to the gills with roids apparently you stopped watching mma when lesnar retired get a fucking clue casual
MMA,removed,i drink only the finest bull semen
MMA,removed,go back to watching wwe
MMA,removed,if you think taking the cheater to task on twitter is more unprofessional than being roided to the gills in whats supposed to be a clean sport then go back to watching wwe
MMA,removed,go back to watching wwe
MMA,removed,one fight back and this sub is overrun with pro wrestling fan lesnar apologists who think hunt taking lesnar to task on twitter for cheating is more unprofessional than lesnar actually fucking cheating kindly gtfo casuals hunt doesnt give a fuck what you think of his social media presence
MMA,removed,go back to watching wwe
MMA,removed,hunt took his defeat with class and didnt complain once until lesnar got popped now you want to act like theyre both unprofessional how about you go pay serious for a grueling mma training camp on short notice to lose to cheater who couldnt even get clean with a month testing exemption yet still got paid more than you for being a walking syringe in what is supposed to be a clean sport you dont even begin to comprehend how much more unprofessional lesnar is in this scenario the consensus fighter in the entire sport was supposed to challenge for the lhw title on the same card he got popped so they threw his ass off the card and hes facing a year suspension for the same offense oh but hunt is being soooo unprofessional these guys only get to opportunities a year on a good year to make money fighting so yes when you get fucked over by a cheater on one of those opportunities its a big deal so once again gtfo and go back to watching wwe
MMA,removed,assholes
MMA,removed,sorry remind me which reporters and political opponents obama had assassinated
MMA,removed,but do you agree she male in female what i get out of it i dont know i guess i dont like people who take peds in contact sports and literally endanger peoples lives fuck her yoel silva chael jones mendes etc etc calling her the greatest female fighter is an insult to every athlete who fights clean
MMA,removed,though i agree with you you can say it at least a tad more diplomatically i feel for the kid and especially his close family parents but hes and had cancer three times sometimes you just get a shit roll of the dice genetically and dont get your fair chance in a world where all medical care is free id say hell yeah keep trying but its not and i imagine this family is thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt already its always easier to have a realistic view on the situation when its not your situation though and im sure most people here would do anything to try and keep their child alive myself included life just isnt fair
MMA,removed,can a get a pic of you please
MMA,removed,stfu
MMA,removed,holy fuck did i say obama was some kind of perfect angel i said youre making a false equivalency which it absolutely is
MMA,removed,ah yes the typical edgy teenager who is woke and thinks he suddenly understands deep government conspiracies that have never gained traction argument
MMA,removed,if you think kadyrov and obama are even in the same ballpark its no longer ignorance its genuine stupidity literally no one but altright extremists would agree with that
MMA,removed,cris bulge is bigger than most dudes
MMA,removed,holy fuck youre so colossally full of shit its not even funny tell me where can i find obamas private security force that went around raping and killing people on a whim
MMA,removed,with her giant dick that im sure he has
MMA,removed,wow i can smell your ignorance from threads away you cant possibly write that whole rant and not think to yourself maybe i am a little batshit crazy
MMA,removed,no i dont because though i find americas foreign interventionism unnecessary and poorly handled its at least conducted in a way that minimizes the human misery it generates its bad but comparing it to the wholesale rape torture and murder of civilians that kadyrov doesnt just allow but encourages and participates in himself is a steaming pile of dogshit the two arent even remotely equivalent or comparable and your insistence that they are is either offensively disingenuous or repugnantly ignorant
MMA,removed,your arguments of bush and obama illegally bombing and droning multiple countries are bafflingly outrageous let me guess you saw some stories about obamas illegal bombings on brietbart conservative weekly the blaze and do you know why neither bush nor obama were charged for war crimes because the united nations isnt affected by altright propaganda and only charge for war crimes based on facts and evidence while youre talking about the war crimes of obama and bush can you at least disavow trump as well for killing civilians an american soldier and an year old girl in his first military raid just want to make sure it is a level argument
MMA,removed,its almost like is a womens and the other is a mens
MMA,removed,is that factoring in the male genitalia or no
MMA,removed,i think shes really hot for some reason
MMA,removed,fucking youre
MMA,removed,let me guess you voted for trump because he will bring world peace

MMA,removed,i hope she doesnt get cocky about it
MMA,removed,stop pushing that shit sub
MMA,removed,its funny because most people here are probably fierce proabortion advocates and yet they think they have the moral high ground to criticize werdum all the atlethes who supported the democratic party in are all much worse than werdum morally speaking like the sociopath called lebron james
MMA,removed,i bet ngannou has a hammerhead shark for a dick
MMA,removed,expect nothing more from a person who think trump will bring world peace and obama is satan
MMA,removed,her clitvagina bulge is nuts
MMA,removed,god damn dude thats someones child dying of brain cancer and you want to make a joke
MMA,removed,oh nice question edgy reddit guy coz you have to donate funds to charities to be able to find that comment inappropriate eh
MMA,removed,how about hanging out with war criminal presidents and prime ministers just because their murdered enemies are in third world countries oit of sight ou of mind youre comfortable with it obama killed hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians with unrestricted drone warfare pretty sure athletes and celebrities hung out with him all the time bush killed even more people i dont recall any protests when he hosted anyone also the west benefits from blood money by far the most thats why it contains the wealthiest countries on earth
MMA,removed,shes kinda jawy but felice can get it
MMA,removed,the virtue signalling is strong with you
MMA,removed,shes fuckin bangin id eat her cunt
MMA,removed,especially in america america is by far as equal as it gets stfu with the bitching america has a black president affirmative action to give failing minorities a leg up lots are in law enforcement plenty in entertainment and sports yeah we are such a racist society you want to see what true racist society is look at saudi arabia were they still sell slaves before you say especially america

MMA,removed,id expect a felice herrig media scrum to he half an hour of her sitting naked sucking on a popsicle while twerking

MMA,removed,on the other hand people seem to shit on trump or obama etc
MMA,removed,you need to look up what morals are dipshit because nothing you described is an immoral action its not even in the realm of ethics let alone morals not even principles even its barely a standard the reason they seem immoral to you is because you dont understand the definition of morals

MMA,removed,psh fuck em
MMA,removed,trump youve been in office min and youve already manage to screw with americans in more ways than one
MMA,removed,when you say casual i assume you mean that these are the people that will watch the event for the fighters and not necessarily for the sport cases in point pacquaio vs mayweather and conor in the ufc so the only way you can draw the casuals in from that perspective is to market the fighters and not necessarily the sport has been poorly marketed and the promos dont get anyone invested into the womens fw title fight holly is the girl who koed ronda and they havent talked much about germaines achievements being an undefeated kickboxing world champ is an even better example the main event is a rematch between tyron and wonderboy and the comain is an interim lw title fight between an undefeated khabib and tony ferguson on a fight winning streak and what do we get as a fight poster for those amazing fight look at httpstwittercombosslogic posters for and now those make me want to watch those fights and i havent even gone into promotion yet theres so much that can be done to market these fighters wonderboy has a degree black belt in karate has an undefeated kickboxing record of and has some amazing knockouts in the octagon woodley is a time division allamerican wrestler also with some vicious power and some insane kos in the octagon add to that the drama of their first fight how wonderboy didnt give up how tyron practically gave everything he had and it wasnt enough and thats a mustsee fight to the casual for khabib not much really needs to be said the man is a combat sambo world champion and he is a relentless grappler he cannot be stopped he will take you down and at this point it seems like no one can beat him however tony ferguson might prove to be the one fighter that can figure out the puzzle that is khabib nurmagomedov he has a wrestling background but hes been submitting people left right and centre in the ufc with multiple darce and rnc finishes he even has an upkick ko on tuf which could be used as a promo tool as an offence of the ground another thing to add on with the promos joe rogan has a minimal impact if any impact at all with how he hypes up fighters its so cookie cutter that it doesnt have any impact when he does it for big fighters httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxnovadagslq hyped up khabib this is how you do a promo imagine the work he could do if he could use videos as well tldr promote the fighters not the sport to casuals make them seem larger than life because of their achievements and create proper posters and promos for them
MMA,removed,oh hey thanks trump what a tool
MMA,removed,i was told this belongs in the current discussion thread its really long but has some well thought out responses
MMA,removed,they dont deserve this but im not going to pretend for a minute that i dont understand why its happened donald trump youre taking everything we worked for motherfucker we gon fight your fuckin ass usa wrestling
MMA,removed,if you say so
MMA,removed,or nations bar citizens from entering their borders when sanctions are applied to them
MMA,removed,yeah so cool how iran stood up for themselves after violating that unsc resolution put in place after the iran deal truly cool
MMA,removed,itself a government being butt hurt is not standing up for itself on either side
MMA,removed,this is an eye for an eye thing but for those who think politics has no place in sports are blind as fuck if politics has no place why are you doing national anthems before every games why does ufc frame their fight cards as usa vs canada or usa vs brazil and fighters come out with flags as well you bet your fucking ass theres a political message olympics is nothing more than commercialized spectacle of whos country has the biggest dick how was hitlers olympics film anything more than political how were black athletes making gestures of civil rights during podium ceremonies anything but political you bet your ass theres a platform in sports for politics look at the great one ali ffs and those of you who are like shame on iran the athletes are innocent like lmao and everyone from different countries are guilty of what this is a shame but wake the fuck up to those who think this is just some sort of nuisance for the poor american wrestlers
MMA,removed,lets me clear about prostitution that involves sucking strange peoples cocks and fucking for money usually in small increments being greedy or daring to take risks for money is not prostitution quite the contrary even making an analogous statement would have to compare trading ones dignity or self respect for trivial sums of cash even if he were taking it in the ass for million that would not make him a prostitute he would be a perverted genius
MMA,removed,yeah real cool httpsenwikipediaorgwikideathtoamerica
MMA,removed,better this then more trucks being driven into crowds and night clubs being shot up by terrorists
MMA,removed,oh yeah totally now shut up the national anthem is coming on
MMA,removed,i wrestled division one and have been part of the wrestling community for years this news is incredibly saddening the wrestling mat though an area of innate combat is an area where these two cultures come together and appreciate one another wrestling has been an area of diplomacy brotherhood and appreciation i know that our athletes love wrestling in front of the iranian fans whose passion adds a huge element of excitement to our sport the events leading up to this response were so unnecessary and president trump has been a major factor in penalizing our own athletes and country from taking part in such a wonderful event
MMA,removed,you can be upset with both but there needs to be an understanding that what precipitated this was completely unnecessary and the fault of donald trump i am saddened iran took this path in response but i am not surprised based on how he has talked about their nation and how he has acted toward its people
MMA,removed,this is somehow gonna be trumps fault i just know it should be ashamed of themselves im pretty sure trumps ban doesnt effect athletes so well done iran youve played yourself
MMA,removed,butthe afro is gone
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,well everyone has their opinion but i sure as hell blame trump over iran if this same tournament was held in usa iran most likely wouldnt even be competing then whos to blame trump or usa wrestling
MMA,removed,ahh so there is no evidence is what you are saying photos of athletes with muscles and your own personal guesswork you dont think this is flimsy second thoughts yeah you are so right ban him for life that photo is conclusive evidence like you say he is muscular it is stone cold dunker case closed your honour
MMA,removed,if so many terrorists didnt come from their countries they could indonesia has a population of muslims and they dont have a terrorism problem how come somalia syria iran etc have such a problem maybe its because obama has been arming them for the past years maybe once we clean up those shit hole countries take away their bombs and assault rifles and stop enforcing sharia law maybe they can join the fucking century google sharia law and tell me you want those goons in america if you do you are a god damn retard
MMA,removed,they kidnap us sailors and ransom them off they charge attack boats at us navy ships in international waters they routinely talk about nuking israel and genociding jews relations were never improving the people are okay but their government is run by theological psychopaths of the highest order
MMA,removed,their dreams are in hold for months drama queen
MMA,removed,not only do they ban jews they also talk publicly about nuking israel
MMA,removed,boo hoo if america hadnt stuck their nose in where it didnt belong in none of this would be an issue
MMA,removed,its a shame a certain political leader is so inflammatory towards muslims that we cant see people compete
MMA,removed,looks like trans cody garbrandt
MMA,removed,everything youre saying is right but why punish the citizens that are victims of these despots just the same
MMA,removed,thanks obama was so much more fun than thanks trump

MMA,removed,dammit meryl streep
MMA,removed,i dont agree with it but i cant blame them at the same time they ban terrorist sponsors yet are best pals with saudi arabia created isis and alqaeda they call the people fighting them terrorists what a fucking joke iran takes no shit and i respect that my family was fucking ruined by the islamic revolution and i hate mullahs but right wing america just want to bomb the shit out of them and take their resources again

MMA,removed,found the crack Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°
MMA,removed,Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°
MMA,removed,how is this a duplicate did someone else post the same video
MMA,removed,what part of american government feels religiously neutral to you im pretty sure every american thing has under god practically written all over it and a lot of people wanted obama out because they automatically deemed him a muslim even though he was a practicing christian nearly every single social issue case where people are antiprogression is because they believe its not gods way and politicians often sight their religious beliefs as motivation for how they run their respective offices and vote the way they do america is a christian nation just because we allow other religions to operate within our country doesnt mean we arent constantly fighting religion to allow freedom for others if we truly had separation of church and state how do you explain the issue of gay marriage and why its even an issue in a truly religiously neutral country there would be no issue if the state recognizes marriage then it shouldnt be gender locked as anyone should have the same opportunity to get married unless marriage was strictly for the government to support families that plan to bare children there is absolutely no reason outside of religious reasons to ban marriage between any two consenting adults
MMA,removed,i wonder how many of them voted for trump
MMA,removed,then whats with your stupid comment that iranian wrestlers werent ready to compete against the americans

MMA,removed,not only the sport but completely ignorant about trump and what the facts are she gets her news from highlight reels created by big news and friends who also saw those same reels she has no real idea what shes talking about everything she said against trump was completely out of context and exactly how the mainstream spun those issues shes a dunce plain and simple weird though how rogan was bashing a comedian for doing an anti trump rant at a comedy show because people are there to see comedy but doesnt say shit about an actor doing an rant when people arent at the golden globes to hear politics joe is just another millionaire afraid trump will take all his money so he stays quiet about his political affiliations while obviously being just another out of touch celebrity from california
MMA,removed,youre not worth the effort its like arguing with a wet towel gtfo
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up lol i hope youve had a great day and continue to have a wonderful year

MMA,removed,i dont even particularly like tyson you just try so hard to shit on him and mcgregor that its actually cringe worthy if someone tries to argue against what youre saying you just respond with the typical lol nutthuger u mad bro etc etc that makes me think youre an edgy year old you shit on conor for losing one fight in the ufc but if someone points out your boy lennox lewis got knocked the fuck out youll say yeah but he won the rematch so it doesnt count
MMA,removed,hes still a total dildo your opinion doesnt change that in the slightest actually you made yourself out to be a jerseyshore dildo nut hugger by whiteknighting on behalf of this douchebag he has diminished the efforts of every worthy name you just mentioned by jumping into the fray himself trying to tap into the team vs team marketability that was briefly advertised before ufc he should be focused on training his fighters and staying the fuck off the internet the only thing he does by trash talking kavanaugh is bring himself into the limelight while he may or may not deserve that attention is irrelevant the way he has conducted himself is dishonorable and shameful and in no way reflects what a proper sensei coach or fucking yoga instructor should do until he alters his public opinion hes a fistpumping dudebro whos about to have his two best fighters on a losing streak
MMA,removed,i literally liked him until this thread hahahaha fuck off mate if you were an actual fan you wouldnt stop liking someone because one of their fans called you out on your shit stop lying

MMA,removed,ill tell you what delusional is conor fans thinking that conor actually won the fight it is obvious who won fight especially when you look at the stats they are in clear favour of nate winning it should be obviously the judges are going to pick conor so there is a third fight also delusional is conor fans saying that conor didnt run away in the fight and posting videos of nate running away when its quite clear that nate was not running away in the michael johnson fight
MMA,removed,vitor vs tito if i recall ill check it again
MMA,removed,plenty of very well informedknowledgeable people said the fight could have gone either way or flat out said diaz won this includes demetrious johnson chael sonnen joe rogan and one of the three fucking judges of the fight lol guess theyre all a bunch of delusional diaz fans who dont know what theyre talking about conor fans are amongst the most bitter people in the world if everyone doesnt suck his dick all the time they apparently are delusionaldont know what theyre talking about

MMA,removed,damn son you shitpost with dat ass Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°
MMA,removed,i never said zero chance there is always a chance of anything happening in mma the odds would just be slim and some people acted like conor would be a favorite to win there are weight classes for a reason i guess technically conor would have a chance against jon jones too but i wouldnt bet any money on it i technically have a chance to tongue punch jennifer lawrences fart box but its probably not going to happen
MMA,removed,so he scheduled to fight rafael dos fucking anjos to dodge frankie thats logical you absolute moron
MMA,removed,most things man been listening to joe rogan for years and they often bring it up about how brian embellishes stories and lies if youre a regular listener then youve heard the accounts

MMA,removed,i will downvote you thats my rating for the little thought you put into your post shitcunt
MMA,removed,you think this is about bjorn but for me this is about people who ask questions then choose to remain wilfully ignorant if youre not interested in actually knowing wtf is happening then stfu the world is full of people who ask with no intention of listening to an answer ignoring evidence and claiming ignorance isnt the same thing as staying neutral you can read up on a topic without interjecting with stupidity so yes please stop replying in general if youre going to be like that itll be better for everyone
MMA,removed,any streams i dont have fightpass
MMA,removed,d e s i g n a t e d
MMA,removed,why is he being so dudded for being an asshole king connor can be the biggest dick on the planet and he gets plenty of love leave the fighting and the banter to the men in the cage and dont judge them for what they say in the heat of the moment
MMA,removed,i need streams please i cant get fightpass
MMA,removed,interracial relationship you mean the very worst most reprehensible form of cultural appropriation imaginable
MMA,removed,bro jon jones obviously would not feel bad if he killed a baby jon jones probably thinks rape is a good thing jon jones probably hates jews jon jones voted for the opposite of the person that you supported
MMA,removed,or you know you have no idea what the fuck you are talking about and should do a little research before you open your mouth next time
MMA,removed,poor bryan hes just quietly having a drink until ronda and her huge clit come bounding over he seems like stu from
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,like i said provide evidence that all these wrestling based fighters passed their college degrees and have a bonafide career awaiting them of course you cant do that because you have edited your statement now to make it look like you said something else entirely for instance jon jones was studying criminal justicelol and then dropped out so doesnt have a college degree that would grant him a career outside of mma daniel cormier graduated in years ago with a degree in socioloogy how does that give him the opportunity to chase a legitimate job with a shitbox degree that he got years ago people arent misreading what you said you said one thing edited it acted like ou said another and are now saying it would be a minimal effort to back it up i have you tagged as full of shit and never seen the inside of a gym appropriate tag for anyone wondering his original comment was people forget that most of these guys have legitimate college degrees that could guarantee them careers in other lines of work besides mma
MMA,removed,floyds manager says mayweather would beat your ass second pause fuck floyds manager millions of irish goons erupt screaming this is top bant lads

MMA,removed,oh conor you leprechaun you
MMA,removed,i mean among us mma fans who checked social media and browsed certain mma sites that promoted that stream it was easy i guess the casuals missed out though
MMA,removed,youre dumb
MMA,removed,fucking strawmans man mcgrzgor fans get triggered so easily
MMA,removed,the mentality behind that is because its so fucking funny to fuck with mcgregors fanbase no other fan in the ufc would think that mcgregor would have a chance vs brock except for one of them mcgregor nuthuggers
MMA,removed,we can hope get rid of that fat lying douchebag
MMA,removed,quit selling us wolf tickets uarbane you dumb motherfucker
MMA,removed,he did not say that he would take a leak but make a leak implying he would fuck her hard and make her wet not sure why you would think he said how he would piss on her

MMA,removed,are you drunk or just not reading no the perfect reason to be a fan is because he is an amazing fighter as a life long martial artist that is what i appreciate really please go back to wwe
MMA,removed,its no more beautiful then silvas the main difference is conor can push the pace if his opponent refuses to lead that being said stfu about conor this is an anderson silva thread
MMA,removed,mystic mac was outboxed by diaz when he was supposed to be in his prime also stfu about mcgregor when its in a thread that has nothing to do with him there are plenty of other posts out there to talk about mcgregor if thats what you want to do
MMA,removed,really theres a difference oh my god everyone gather round this guy has something interesting and relevant to say its technically a knockout im technically correct i know the difference along with everyone else you brave keyboard warrior who points out technicalities to try and feel smart youre technically a dipshit

MMA,removed,its not like the bar has to be high when your core audience has down syndrome
MMA,removed,hes the only person on the embeddeds to not have any friends appear in them and said he pretty much only hangs out with his dog since his injury and he doesnt have any friends or a partner anymore because they all ditched him so i know stuff hes said about his own life are you going to contradict what he said himself

MMA,removed,all of the ufc streaming ive ever done that was lessthanlegit has come from bt sport streams so it seems like its been available for a while
MMA,removed,im now going to pirate their ppvs instead of paying for them like ive been doing all year what a bizarre fucking situation
MMA,removed,get a vpn tunnel bear works good change your countrylocation to hong kong price for ufc ppv is usd buy it on your account close vpn and watch ppv when it is airing it will be linked to your account so you will be able to watch it on anything that has a ufc app or straight from your computer
MMA,removed,i dont want no mothafuckin blue belt with my gi you cocksuckas what like i owe to a bookkeeper downstairs go fuck your motha im into that real shit no fuckin shesquahanna jitz with fuckin uncle joey welcome to my house mothafuckas
MMA,removed,why is this shit allowed literally has zero to do with mma fuck off over to rpoormegivemeattention
MMA,removed,yeah and thats gay for right now
MMA,removed,just stream the channel bro free
MMA,removed,another one for the pirate
MMA,removed,switch your bb to eir and youll get bt sport free
MMA,removed,just watch for free it is such a bullshit model of making money the fact that i have to buy ppv and fightpass to watch an event that starts at am in the morning is just stupid now you get no money at all
MMA,removed,uthelynxer please take a seat its not easy for me to say this it never is but youve got a severe case of being a year old girl there are treatments available to help you manage this but unfortunately there is no cure im afraid youll always think that douchebags like scoggins are hilarious and youre going to have to come to terms with that on your own
MMA,removed,if you wanna support the business model of fight pass my suggestion is to pay for fight pass but pirate everything else cancelling fight pass just gives more power to bt sports or whatever this is my personal view anyway there are many other valid perspectives on the issue
MMA,removed,use a vpn to another country that doesnt have a tv deal such as an asian country youll even only have to pay usd for the ppv when your ip originates from one of those countries like south korea japan or hong kong germany might work also
MMA,removed,have fightpass and thought this would be my get out of jail card after signing onto another year long contract with virgin media in may looks like its back to illegally stream it to watch it live
MMA,removed,yeah i was thinking that but honestly im not going to go so far out of my way to use a vpn so i can trick the ufc into letting me pay them if they dont want me to have a direct line to their product thats fine by me there are plenty of great streamers on the internet id be more than happy to donate to
MMA,removed,i want to pay you for this but you wont let me because bt pay them way more specifically to stop you from being able to buy it directly from the ufc they are paying for the exclusivity and they are paying a lot more for it than the money ufc made off selling ppv streams directly theyre cunts though everyone should pirate
MMA,removed,yeah i know the feeling man dont worry theres plenty of good streamers who run them for free if theres no other alternative
MMA,removed,just stream the fights on your computer
MMA,removed,theres always hd streams available for free
MMA,removed,because it will be geoblocked for his location he will need a vpn to bypass it its better to just get a vpn and use a country with cheaper ppv cost i bought for hd doing this
MMA,removed,i have a purple belt under rafael dias in florida shut the fuck up already you lost take a walk
MMA,removed,rmmastreams
MMA,removed,you just deleted a bunch of comments that were getting downvoted into oblivion to preserve your karma dont be scared homie you delete from your history regularly im taking it easy on you and giving you odds its good that you backpeddled and are acknowledging how much your years of dedication to attain that karma means to you which is why you posted about karma in response to a silly comment of mine karma has infected your mind and youve dedicated a significant portion of your time to it for years so when you want to talk shit but your just a dork thats been chasing sweet sweet karma for years aint nobody gonna take shit from the likes of you step the fuck up or step the fuck off homie odds on an account deletion bet dont be scared
MMA,removed,firestickkodisports devil
MMA,removed,i would buy it if they would let me pay them can fuck right off if they think im getting subscription tv torrent the next day or illegal stream works out cheaper quicker and more convenient
MMA,removed,there are tons of ways mate just google it or go to rmmastreams
MMA,removed,perhaps try using a vpn to get it through ufctv ppv i usually use it to get the cheaper rates for ppv i usually pretend im in germany
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,lmfao what the fuck are you on about no one said shit about anything about that hes just a boring bland ass dude thats it now youve just confirmed to everyone youre likely a gay liberal feminist who was never accepted by society and is now bitter and sad dead serious
MMA,removed,entertainment is the name of the game here if you want insightful go back to your moms basement and read insightful books while you jerk off to anime

MMA,removed,try rboxingstreams the websites are mostly the same tbh
MMA,removed,you can always say that your vpn was on for other whatever reasons and that you forgot to turn it off when buying not sure where you are from but i never heard of someone being caught for this not even canceled banned from fightpass subscription because of this but if you are still paranoid simply do not do it problem solved
MMA,removed,except to dat ass
MMA,removed,liberal hipster spotted
MMA,removed,go on ill indulge you what is it about the service provider eir using their backbone eircom network to provide internet in the same technological manner as vodafone and others that you find shit if you say customer service that will be a valid claim if you say speed or any other shit youre talking bollocks
MMA,removed,legal yes ethical probably not but realistically if it was a massive problem for them theyd just do what netflix did and crack down on all major vpns so i dont see a problem
MMA,removed,regarding the vpn option that people are advising people to do isnt there a strong chance you could get caught doing that for instance i imagine when you sign up for the ppv youre a debitcredit card to pay for that with a billing address now i guess for a one off you could pretend youre on holidayvacation but if your billing address is listed as ireland and all your ppv purchases look like theyre occurring from somewhere in asia dont you think the people who work for the ufc trying to counter piracy are going to pick up on those anomalies eventually
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my page then you peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,people were complaining that lawlerwoodley was a shit matchup and cried about condit not getting a rematch and then forgot about it when woodley knocked lawlers ass out the ufc is a promoted product where they are pitching to the public constantly boxing is not an organized sport its made up of individuals
MMA,removed,dad looks like a mexican neil degrasse tyson

MMA,removed,you idiot the only way conor fights mayweather is thru dana and they didnt strike a deal in weeks after his bout with diaz so fucking dumb
MMA,removed,stfu nut clinger
MMA,removed,unpopular opinion i think that stoppage was bullshit there were seconds left in the round and it didnt look like daley had stopped defending himself diaz was in a similar situation like seconds before this and it wasnt stopped true diaz had much more control than daley had when he was down but i still think big john shouldve let him get out of the round
MMA,removed,interim champion cries internally
MMA,removed,i didnt spread false information at all also reading your comment history youre clearly made an account to make a false claim on rlegaladvise and then to just go around being an asshole on other subs

MMA,removed,thats hilarious thanks for sharing
MMA,removed,what the guy youre responding to isnt an asshole at all the sparring partner is obviously doing nothing to give back to his teammate op hes using him to get out pent up aggression and bully on a noobie its pathetic
MMA,removed,already been posted so go get your clicks somewhere else
MMA,removed,op said bendo might have the most splitdecision wins in ufc history then said jake shields would be a close second jake has split decision wins in ufc title fights so obviously he was replying to the second half of the op so following the natural progression of the thread i listed how many split decisions total they had in the ufc including the gleison tibau who has the most does that make sense moron
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,if someone told you its their opinion the world is flat would you accept that its just their opinion no you might ignore them but you know they are an idiot and wrong same goes for this situation and i dont like to call you an idiot or anything because its not necessary but if you cant figure out when things are matter of opinions and when they are matter of facts then you leave me with no choice you sir are an idiot lets hope we never cross paths again
MMA,removed,id love you to take a big shit on my chest while a vagrant beats me off with his unwashed hand
MMA,removed,hes a conor nut hugger has only ever posted about conor and he knows nothing about the sport
MMA,removed,another idiot putting the ufc ahead of the fighters probably jacking off to conor pictures
MMA,removed,tainted supplements im going to hell i know
MMA,removed,at least you will get the reddit karma associated with talking about it even though you cant really talk about it
MMA,removed,but then how do they get retweets and hits to their webpage
MMA,removed,not sure if you facebook or not but when someone dies the natural grieving process is to pretend you care way more than you do most importantly you need to make it look like you were a huge fan well before you knew they were sick or dying
MMA,removed,if you look at off shore markets you can easily pull a dollar for every upvotes american redditors make up of reddit but hold of the karma because of that here in the states the value drops significantly
MMA,removed,i think its absolutely fair and should be expected as long as those who know exactly what happened are intentionally keeping everyone out of the loop hopefully they are honest with us sooner rather than later to keep speculation to a minimum
MMA,removed,or it could be drug abuse
MMA,removed,nice try pablo but its happened shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,if he can break someones doctor patient confidentiality over twitter for his own personal gain he can fill us in with the info
MMA,removed,what a fucking jerk off
MMA,removed,same reason i can call trump an idiot despite never running for president
MMA,removed,yeah you definitely fit right in with them seriously man take a look in the mirror theres a reason youve been getting bombarded with downvotes and called a douchebag in several places on this sub also its really obvious that youre the one downvoting all my posts youre not fooling anyone one more thing jfc
MMA,removed,so what are you trying to prove here i said you are coming across as an asshole with your comments and your response is that im not a fan of his sorry dont really get what youre trying to doprove by being an asshole on reddit because people are sad about a fighter being in critical condition it comes across like you saw people upset about a potential tragedy and you thought it would be enjoyable to spend your friday afternoon egging them on
MMA,removed,well your original point was to call into question reporters motives for tweeting about josh but not the news so you are being disingenuous there you clearly had a point to make and sent many posts to make it an untimely accidental death of someone is a tragedy regardless of circumstances also given that joshs struggles were widely documented and drug abuse is widely considered a disease i think dying of an overdose is a tragedy you may have a more pessimistic view toward it then i do and thats fine but thats your illness to overcome my point was to inform you that you are coming off as an asshole for all i know and from what you have more or less proven is that you werent aware you came off this way its not that your opinion is different its the fact that you made a lot of shitty comments about josh reporters many of whom are personal friends of his drug addicts and basically went out of your way to disagree with everyone clearly for your own joy i get thinking differently and all but wouldnt you perceive the insane amount of down votes and backlash as proof you are potentially in the wrong here
MMA,removed,what part of my comment are you laughing at and im so more like average guy
MMA,removed,dont think you should be insulting anyones large proportions when youve gotten all upset on the subreddit after admitting you have giant man boobs
MMA,removed,its unethical to speak in any form on the medical condition of someone regardless of your profession period his wife just had a baby both her and the child are doing fine mcgregors ankle was just a high sprain should be good for uswaggymcswagsabunch has had the dick removed from his forehead and looks like hes going to pull through
MMA,removed,yea i dont know why people like you think you have the right to tell businesses how to run their show you people love acting like the ufc is run by hitler from behind the scenes bellator is worse but youre still going to watch ufc right and hes disrespected too bad quit acting like a high schooler why would i give up a good employee for a lousy one pulls out constantly and doesnt do pressers
MMA,removed,my boy conor is gonna rape him

MMA,removed,rednecks are annoying but brazilians are just out of control thugs
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up he was talking to the officials around him and was aware enough at that point to at least acknowledge stipe and from all his post fight interviews he thinks he is a better fighter overall he snubbed him watch it
MMA,removed,oh i thought it was ignorance but youre just an idiot my bad
MMA,removed,asking a question on an mma show in an mma subreddit really not that weird jackass

MMA,removed,hey guy we get it youre an ass
MMA,removed,or youre just really short
MMA,removed,nope khabib will get the next shot stfu period
MMA,removed,no now shut the fuck up about it
MMA,removed,ive literally made it clear i know what youre saying and im trying to explain to you that im saying hes known more from striking which is why people refer to him as a striker everyone in the ufc can grapple so youre claiming that not one person can be known as a striker as well as nobody can be known as a grappler if they know how to strike as well im trying to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume youre not an idiot but you just dont seem to be reading or giving any effort into understanding what im saying and then you continue to call me a moron or say that i dont comprehend what youre saying when im literally letting you know i get what youre saying youre saying hes more than a striker and shouldnt be labeled as such which is like saying you cant label any ufc fighter as anything other than an mma fighter since everyone in the ufc is capable of grappling and striking ive really laid it out for you here so if you still dont get what im saying then there truly is no hope
MMA,removed,fuck off troll
MMA,removed,the fuck you on about dude are you crying in a bathtub somewhere

MMA,removed,if a random man in denver offers to check your oil he doesnt mean your car unless youre attracted to him you should be aware that the dipstick he slyly refers to is code for his penis and the oil i believe is your asshole or his semen but this i didnt have time to clarify as i was in a hurry to escape this interaction
MMA,removed,i would just watch a stream
MMA,removed,youre the only little twerp bragging about how much karma you have like it will actually get you somewhere outside of the internet
MMA,removed,someone should have called the police because that was rape
MMA,removed,yup joe b said it on ufc tonight
MMA,removed,no it doesnt itll never happen anyone who thinks it might happen is an idiot your shit posting is ruining this sub leave
MMA,removed,this guy understandsthere is so much marketing behind conor its no wonder people tuned in mcgregor fans will do anything to put him on a pedestal
MMA,removed,new anderson silva hoping to see him in the ufc soon
MMA,removed,im korean as well and when the comment was made lim did look chinked out to the max i laughed pretty hard but mostly due to the red neck accent

MMA,removed,lol then they fall back to the typical pc culture straw man response that theyre somehow fighting for equality you arent fighting for equality youre going on a witch hunt over a corner man who made a racist comment because you dont like the person and want to feel morally superior mcgregor called a german a nazi and mocked the oppression that brazilians in favelas face and you didnt say anything because you like him get off your high horse you pathetic little bitch

MMA,removed,youre the dumbest thing ive ever heard sorry bruh i dont know if you are new to sports or just dense but what was stated is a simple fact the point of what was said doesnt mean you treat rm like some bum off the street and completely erase any memory of his past accomplishments it means that you base his pay on what you think he can bring you in the future youll find very few cases of athletes being paid more money to make up for over performing on his previous contract

MMA,removed,i dont believe he thinks wrestling is for the weak or something like that he probably just wanted to make a point about daniel not trying to put on a show on the biggest card etc something along those lines and just chose his words very poorly genuinely curious when donald cerrone said that he fought like a fag what did he mean then what was he equating to homosexuality even if he truly didnt mean it as youre suggesting what was he saying a boring fight wouldnt be compared to gay guys neither would watching a guy you dont like win the only thing that makes sense is that it was a wrestling match with a lot of grappling now if youre so sure donald isnt a homophobe i wont suggest that he was comparing wrestling to being gay but since youre obviously way more informed than me what was he saying

MMA,removed,because youre saying dumb shit on a public forum its really no surprise that youre so stupid as to think that youre having a private conversation on reddit though exactly what id expect based on your previous comment haha
MMA,removed,like a pack of hungry wolves who have smelt blood there is a sense of unity and self belief in their eyes bolstered by meishas win and new status as a champion i never used to meisha particularly but now im starting to recognise her as a she godess powerful spiritual women would bury my nose so far in that ass
MMA,removed,what an ass
MMA,removed,stfu the master lock is no joke
MMA,removed,oh fuck carlos hes a motherfucker
MMA,removed,lets be honest here i would say that on average black people are more racist than white people sure there is alot more white people in total but i you often see widely accepted movements like blacklivesmatter which in reality are incredibly racist looking for race superiority rather than equality just like the neofeminist bullshitters want gender superiority
MMA,removed,staying true to your name i see you should change it to selfishdumbliberal
MMA,removed,blacklivesmatter
MMA,removed,white people are always so quick to play the race card
MMA,removed,youre why your dad needed a rubber
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,most democrats are not black supremacists but most black supremacists are democrats just one of the gems from ops recent posting history
MMA,removed,only a pussy pass
MMA,removed,no you just randomly calling it bullshit that op pulled out of his ass is not the same thing you are just being an asshole for no reason what so ever if you disagree thats fine but dont go around claiming peoples posts are bullshit if you cant prove it youre just a douche bag asshole
MMA,removed,yep call a spade a spade fuck the bullshit
MMA,removed,you are a racist bitch
MMA,removed,affirmative please step right this way sir rredpill
MMA,removed,yeah every time i see a dolt parrot this line my response is hanlons razor isnt very sharp
MMA,removed,and she will continue to do it too for the same reasons that this thread keeps getting reported to the mods black people are not allowed to be called racist unfortunately

MMA,removed,if the bj that showed up for the edgar fight showed up to the sanchez fight diego would have tore that ass up
MMA,removed,id tear ur asshole
MMA,removed,how do i feel i feel like telling people to shut the fuck up about it these are grown ass men signing contracts knowing full well what the consequences are you crying about a fighter having brain damage is like crying for a hooker thats hiv positive
MMA,removed,i appreciate your effort now fuck off

MMA,removed,the irish cock he chokes on

MMA,removed,time ramadan place pork processing plant see you there khabib
MMA,removed,nope tagged as illiterate fucktard no going back now
MMA,removed,your wig is a freak show stfu
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,copying from one of my other comments per meltzer the fighters made of revenue in the ufc in made million gross profit on million revenue or of revenue reported thus if the fighters received of revenue the ufc would be operating at a loss in the ufcs profit margin was only not particularly healthy and we could easily foresee a year like that again considering how much profit is attributable to specific individuals if the fighters percentage of revenue was roughly the same in as it was in pure speculationi do not have any figures then them getting of revenue means a loss for the ufc it seems to me that there is simply not as much room for negotiation here as people would like unless the ufc can cut costs elsewhere sure dana white could take a million dollar pay cut if his million dollar salary is correct but the percentage of fighter revenue would go up by a percentage point or so in general cutting operating expenses means less money spent on more extraneous things like growing the sport expanding into new markets lobbying for regulative change and so forth in terms of comparing this to other sports there are a wide range of costs that the ufc has that the sports leagues they are being compared to do not and the ufc does not get any and furthermore there is no mention on the pfa website that the mlb nhl and nfl are nonprofit leagues which drastically changes the percentage of revenue available for players the other thing that needs to be considered when we look at redistributing profit to fighters is that a large chunk of the ufcs profit is swallowed up by things like taxes and interest payments these were substantial for zuffa but they are even higher for the new owners see according to meltzer the ufc paid million in interest payments in on i think around million in debt wme borrowed to purchase the ufc and is expected to be paying around million per year in interest that is more than the ufc profited in million for comparison
MMA,removed,what youre being pedantic fuck off with that shit
MMA,removed,httpsmybuketpwzvjyyrlyjpg code on httpsgithubcombagmandmbot
MMA,removed,tf are you talking about more than half of his wins have been against ufc caliber competition of whom he has completely dominated khabib cant even say that he finished tibau and a lot of people actually have tibau winning against khabib
MMA,removed,take your salty tears elsewhere no one cares
MMA,removed,im not broke but for nosebleeds is ridiculous i would rather watch it on hd screen at home and scratch my balls at my own leisure
MMA,removed,being roided up and looking like you are roided up are not always mutually inclusive
MMA,removed,and the one before that was against the last lw champ so how about you stfu
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,get the fuck out of here dickhead
MMA,removed,is this the best we can do
MMA,removed,i remeber an article about a japanese mother who jerked her son off so he can concentrate on studying childhood in contemporary japan although somewhat more western than that of other eastern nations still includes masturbation by mothers to put them to sleep parents often have intercourse with their children in bed with them and cosleeping with parents physically embracing the child often continues until the child is ten or fifteen one recent japanese study found daughters sleeping with their fathers over percent of the time after age recent sex surveys report memories of sexual abuse even higher than comparable american studies and hot lines of sexual abuse report motherson incest in almost a third of the calls the mother saying to her teenage son its not good to do it alone your iq becomes lower i will help you or you cannot study if you cannot have sex you may use my body or i dont want you to get into trouble with a girl have sex with me instead historically japan has been one of the most endogamous societies in the world with incestuous marriages in court circles being approved even in historical times and preferred sibling cousin uncleniece and auntnephew marriages having been so extensive that genetics experts have discovered that the incestuous inbreeding has affected the size and health of the japanese even today there are rural areas in japan where fathers marry their daughters when the mother has died or is incapacitated in accordance with feudal family traditions
MMA,removed,what shit oh just the tiny matter of getting knocked the fuck out in seconds you deluded cunt you that alone makes him kind of not the greatest featherweight of all time go wipe up aldos ped tainted piss silly cunt that you are
MMA,removed,oh fuck off
MMA,removed,to be fair he never got his first unjustified attempt
MMA,removed,who
MMA,removed,reminds me of httpsyoutubeiqnlxuolzew nsfw
MMA,removed,yes bitch he has the interim
MMA,removed,get them berries out of your mouth
MMA,removed,and wow huge surprise youre a neckbeard donald trump supporter who calls muslims subhuman pieces of shit nice
MMA,removed,so is rda isnt he jesus youre not very bright
MMA,removed,try not to let your inbreeding and years of being bullied as a kid inform your opinions as an adult
MMA,removed,your emotions are getting the best of you is that your defense mechanism so you can remain in denial about your neckbeardism its funny that you choose that route when you spend half your time on reddit posting about how much you hate muslims and poor people on rthedonald
MMA,removed,conor physically cant make anymore due to x or y reason meanwhile its complete bollocks made up for maximum pr positivity
MMA,removed,conservatives with little empathy who are ignorant to the social and economic conditions of other demographic groups in the blue corner liberals with bleeding hearts and a propensity to excuse and coddle the sometimes reprehensible actions of members of a minority group in the red corner here we go
MMA,removed,so youre saying that conors only reputable wins are aldo holloway and nate is that correct can you answer the question instead of trying to dodge it
MMA,removed,are you sure youre irish
MMA,removed,youre not that bright the referee is untouchable in any sport period there is nothing probable that could ever happen in the cage ring or on the field than laying hands on a ref get out of your basement and do something any kind of sport before commenting
MMA,removed,it was a joke since this thread will be a shit show from all sides not above it i just feel that like many things its a nuanced situation it brings out people with really passionate opinions one way or the other who generally just yell at each other and go nowhere theres no discourse just virtue signalling from both sides the parent comment in this thread implies the people of ferguson just burned down their town for the hell of it which is a gross misrepresentation of a century of systematic mistreatment by black people and the enforcement arm of the state the police at the same time the people who are smashing up stores and burning cars are acting as individuals and they are responsible as individuals for their own actions getting a bad hand in terms of economic and sociological factors does not excuse a single persons actions theyre useful academic tools on how to better society but when people start pointing to them as justifications for violent behavior they imply a lack of autonomy that simply isnt true lets get back to slinging shit at each other though thats always fun
MMA,removed,he won dominantly and isnt just sitting home jerking off hes trying to make history
MMA,removed,sorry i was mistaken it was a lw fight at ww apologies haha what poor guy you got confused his first fight with nate was a lw fight at ww you really dont know much about mma do you
MMA,removed,i do not like this post
MMA,removed,maybe if she cuts off her dick
MMA,removed,damn i am going to illegally stream the shit out of this card
MMA,removed,lol yeah just dont reply because you said some stupid shit that shows that you have no idea what youre talking about just another neckbeard conor fanboy
MMA,removed,are you sure it isnt because youre afraid of him because hes muslim you havent given any reasons and you keep saying stuff that makes no sense conor vs poirier was a lw fight at ww explain that one luke
MMA,removed,probably by as dumb as people like you but if you are a irishmen or a scot yo cant refuse to be a celt
MMA,removed,stfu
MMA,removed,shut your fookin mouth hahahahaha
MMA,removed,shut your fucking mouth you fool and stop watching that midget porn and get help
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,read the comments of people saying eddie looks rattled then read their flairs ahahahahaa
MMA,removed,how many of you degenerates would drink conors cum if you had the chance half the monkeys commenting here were probably on the diaz hype train months ago
MMA,removed,good fuck him
MMA,removed,cowboy looked like a don why the fuck was every dressed up except for the girls fucking lesbians
MMA,removed,conors line about one riddin dick and one lickin my toesss should be attributed to jj and kk
MMA,removed,we do like dead jokes over here kenny florian
MMA,removed,if there are any extra asses around somewhere can we get arianny one too she doesnt have an ass either
MMA,removed,one riding dick one licking my toes
MMA,removed,i hope aldo gets treated with more respect here than those clowns on sherdog hes one of the greatest fighters in the history of the sport greater than mcgregor could ever be
MMA,removed,youre in full form tonight arent ya
MMA,removed,aldo didnt dodge shit sick of conor fanboys pushing these stupid lies fuck off were done
MMA,removed,still watching it you dork
MMA,removed,well she was fighting a dude there look at the weigh in staredown and the adams apple on cyborgs neck
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up alvarez the irish dont want to be your friend they want to see you lynched and paraded around the streets of new york
MMA,removed,the sheeps assholes newbs and wee fans will never let this rest all youll be seeing on jeremys social media is going to be nothing but who are you and mcgregor will butcher you comments sigh
MMA,removed,dae reddit is so many different types of losers
MMA,removed,and this is why people think all mcgregor fans are complete assholes
MMA,removed,literally who fuck off
MMA,removed,lol it was cyborg who ducked ronda get your fucking facts straight
MMA,removed,well seriously what did he do
MMA,removed,that statement lets us know that youre just another asshole with low self esteem that hides behind a keyboard here
MMA,removed,greta lets all be super sensitive about this and it will all get better and go away no thats fucking stupid there is little doubt in my mind that a guy that looks like him who has been popped very recently that his health was effected by the steroid use
MMA,removed,just because someone died doesnt mean you should start respecting him automatically
MMA,removed,its called hyping a fight its a prank its a prank bro its not shit talking its hyping a fight its not rape its called party sex
MMA,removed,watch luke thomas video kimbo slice was mma and stop being a dick
MMA,removed,did i say he was winning no i said it was competitive and that he was rallying toward the end fuck off
MMA,removed,people call him a pretender because he didnt dedicate his entire life to training mma brah fact is he destroyed when the ufc had a weak hw division and i still think its weak now albeit much better than huge disparity in talent and made a lot of money doing so also his sword tattoo makes it look like hes constantly being titty fucked
MMA,removed,eye gouging is legal in the ufc though they might say it isnt but i can think of like egregious eye poking incidents off the top of my head and ive been watching the ufc semiregularly since and ive never seen anyone actually punished for doing it in a way that cost them anything at all its almost to the point where youre stupid if you dont gouge the other guy in the eyes first because if he does it to you first youll lose probably and the ref isnt going to make it right for you
MMA,removed,so ariel breaking news and giving his opinion his him doing his job but black doing the same is a problem get the fuck out here motherfucker
MMA,removed,who the hell is robin black
MMA,removed,shoo neckbeard
MMA,removed,hes saying were losing all our shaved gorillas and replacing the loss with tiny mexican drug mules obviously our gene pool will suffer if this continues and then when the chinese invade we wont have any giant manapes to protect us im not saying i agree but its hard to fault his patriotism and grasp of gorilla warfare
MMA,removed,i think i found it

MMA,removed,i think i found it
MMA,removed,i think i found it
MMA,removed,i think i found it
MMA,removed,i think i found it
MMA,removed,team stream
MMA,removed,just stream the fight pass prelims online for free checkout rmmastreams
MMA,removed,a child why because i feel that carefully stage managed and well produced reveals are a more exciting and enjoyable way of receiving news than seeing that fucking thumbnail of ariel in a baseball cap accompanied by a word spoiler of something thats about to be announced in half an hour nah thats called personal preference mate go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,my uber driver today said that ali and and kimbo dying days from each other really sucks but to look in the bright side this was the only way he was ever going to get his name so close to alis on anything
MMA,removed,well he is a nazi and this is felony fights

MMA,removed,itd be great to see sage put up an instagram post of him telling his dad to fuck off and that he was in charge of his own life from now on itd be great to see a family get torn apart over one dudes instagram post who the fuck things like this fucking leftists
MMA,removed,god bless streams
MMA,removed,illuminati all over your body
MMA,removed,he sucks my dick i looked trough his contract and found that nothing is preventing him from sucking my dick so if he gets another leak from a ufc insider that seems credible and decides to tweet it i see no reason why he shouldnt just suck my dick
MMA,removed,why not just stream the event obviously have to have internet anyway to watch it at all
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,to be honest i feel like they arent sexualizing these bitches enough

MMA,removed,ferg ackbar was lined up and ferg got injured allah fought horcher and cant fight due to terrorist training falling on week of ramanda eddie beat though ugly former champs in giblert and pettis and is maybe a bigger sell than ferg id rather him tony too but chisea has to get choked out first i guess
MMA,removed,oh shut up seems like he gave the coach the champs tshirt which is different from the challenger and also did you ever thought to yourself that maybe just maybe the contract between reebok and ufc has a rule that says that the fighters after the fight must wear reebok shirts or something along those lines which would leave ufc responsible for following those rules set in the contract this lorenzo and white bashing is getting ridiculous
MMA,removed,so since you know that the fighters must wear reebok shirts after the fight it makes this post even more stupid
MMA,removed,that is some next level stupiditygood job
MMA,removed,hey lick my asshole i bet youre average
MMA,removed,if you are ok with your kid being a bastard that is

MMA,removed,and of course he has that fuckin belt with him
MMA,removed,i was already getting the same level of exposure at that time that i spoke to conor because i was writing music for cage warriors and actually created their new theme song that was used in conors promo
MMA,removed,cruz vs dillashaw edgar vs maynard trilogy or at least the second fight and for anyone that thinks a quick ko proves you are without a doubt the better fighter check out the jds vs cain trilogy
MMA,removed,is he fucking serious does aldo really believe this shit
MMA,removed,were you bullied in school serious question im curious to know if theres a correlation
MMA,removed,you think trying to attack my masculinity is going to add weight to your argument of course its a possibility its also a possibility that i win the lottery off a scratch ticket i find on the ground but not fucking likely
MMA,removed,you never even watch an even stfu you fraud you like big talking go fucking watch wwe fake ass mma fan stop coming here acting like you know anything
MMA,removed,make no effort to learn english openly talk shit on own employer gain reputation for coasting on fights omg i cant fathom why no one who matters is clamoring for this rematch gsp didnt cut wwe promos and did alright try hopping off aldos nuts
MMA,removed,why do you like aldo
MMA,removed,lol mcgregor fan boys wonder why everyone hates them and mocks them for being casuals and then you read these comments
MMA,removed,read that guys comment history youre replying to the definition of a nut hugger waste of time
MMA,removed,lol at the idea of this going knowing who those fighters are he knows one fighter and the names of the people hes fought
MMA,removed,haha conor fan boy
MMA,removed,shhhh your talking to a conor fan they dont know much
MMA,removed,look at his comment history hes the most triggered guy alive
MMA,removed,thats his point thats a quote from conor one of excuses he made for losing but nut huggers relabled them as reasons because hes infallible to them
MMA,removed,youre fun at parties
MMA,removed,oh look another mcgregor fan acting like a prick why must people like you ruin being a conor fan for the rest of us
MMA,removed,how to spot a casual
MMA,removed,those are in no way comparable they are completely different types of fighters the only way aldo does not get knocked out is if he manages not take a single left hand for minutes conor is a fucking sniper and aldo has trained for years in a way that leaves himself open to counters nobody he fought before was able to exploit it conor does the alvarez fight will have been extremely competitive in comparison to what an aldo rematch would be like
MMA,removed,clit flick lifetime movie network
MMA,removed,just watch aldo and conors highlights you will see who does more damage on there opponents youre right one guy knocks them out while the other havent finish a fight in years yeah i wonder who does more damage mendes and edgar both managed to land multiple clean hits on aldo mcgregor is a better and longer boxer than both mendes and edgar combined what do you think will happen oh wait it already did jose got startched
MMA,removed,youre looking at it completely wrong way i feel bad for you
MMA,removed,aldo then
MMA,removed,the salt mine keeps giving meanwhile mcgregor is fine and dandy on his home with his title expecting a child or something just move the fuck on aldo maybe next time dont get knocked the fuck out in seconds if you wanna talk trash
MMA,removed,matt brown went from to after beating silva and that was when silva was still a solid prospect at no need to be an asshole but if you wanna be an asshole try to be one that is actually correct
MMA,removed,if conor could always ko a goat in seconds everyone else should be knokced out in secs but he doesnt this may be the most retarded thing ive read on this sub and thats saying a lot
MMA,removed,stop crying and go watch old aldo videos
MMA,removed,liz the queen carmouche
MMA,removed,cool story bro just stop answering my message so i dont have to see your weird raging
MMA,removed,mmw is gonna be one of the best cards of the year and the second best nonconor card second to the mma gods are testing our faith
MMA,removed,hes fighting this saturday
MMA,removed,shut your fookin mouth youll do nuttin youll do fookin nuttin
MMA,removed,id imagine the downvotes are coming from the manlets its a harsh reality
MMA,removed,aldos too small for mcgregor hes a little bitch got kod in seconds
MMA,removed,edgar vs maynard
MMA,removed,he didnt barely win he clearly won no he barely won he won by round and walked away on crutches with a majority decision win it wasnt even a unanimous win he barely won clearly is a completely different type of adjective to barely ihes likely to get caught clean again i disagree point is if conor gets a pointless rematch to an already pointless fight why doesnt aldo get a chance at redemption to something that has clearly damaged his legacy aldo brings nothing to the table that suggests mcgregor wouldnt ko him again speed leg kicks better endurance nothing suggested that conor would be able to beat diaz because nothing he threw managed to do anything to him in the first fight yet he won i swear conor fanboys dont want the aldo rematch for some reason its pretty hilarious
MMA,removed,is octothorpe the word of the day for january in that new day calendar you bought yourself for christmas i apologize for not realizing that in a forum filled with abbreviated fighters names and acronyms that using symbols to save time would so offensive perhaps you can tell me where you found your copy of big words to use when trying to sound like a pretentious asshole
MMA,removed,problem is that she would smash gabi standing up ruin rizins star
MMA,removed,he clearly won you really are slow arent you why is barely won mutually exclusive from clearly won winning by one round is a clear win yet can also be described as him barely winning because he got kod in seconds even more reason why a rematch should happen at least he didnt get beaten by a ranked journeyman on zero training camp who decisively won and neutralized everything conor had the minute conor fights the bigger man no matter how mediocre of a fighter he got rekt funny how that happened what he boxed him up gassed diaz always gets cut and diaz didnt even have a training camp yet he still whooped conors ass aldo didnt even get a chance he rushed in and got punished which has happened to plenty of fighters who then went on to dominate in the rematch gsp vs serahughes jdscain why are you ignoring clear examples of similar instances to what happened to aldo cain vs jds is possibly the best parallel cain got caught cleanly yet came back to dominate in the rematches but im giving reasons why you shouldnt be complaining about the lack of one you havent given me a single reason except from specify muh seconds like some typical nuthugger if conor got a rematch with diaz which was an already pointless fight then so should aldo
MMA,removed,nick diaz vs paul daley one of the craziest fights ive seen
MMA,removed,cool but she gives head or not
MMA,removed,if i want to say fuck you and look at you to your face and say hey fuck your mother then i can do that i dont have to about like you know being a good role model you know
MMA,removed,thats only u fatty cakes
MMA,removed,yeah but lets not act like robbie isnt hittable he has made a career out of dog fights he is very hittable if you have the power woodley has and youre fighting a brawler you have a good chance of landing a bomb that doesnt make him a good striker and infact his boxing is elementary compared to conor
MMA,removed,hes a manlet
MMA,removed,as sure as a diaz fan boy can be lol lets just say i predict nate winning the rubber before it gets past round but ive also bet against jones in every fight hes been in because of sheer hatred and i cheer against mcfaggor for the same reason so i wouldnt put too much stock in any of my predictions
MMA,removed,errmerrgherd
MMA,removed,still good fights so stfu
MMA,removed,well youre only one person so nobody really gives a fuck about you
MMA,removed,not wanting to do a second world media tour in a year makes him a little bitch and his reasoning was training harder which benefited him highly seeing his stamina in the second fight last much longer or did you forget the ufc pushed him off the card when he wouldnt make the press conference
MMA,removed,you people are like those guys screaming nier at ali fights appreciate greatness it only comes around once in a lifetime
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,this bitch is mad about everything
MMA,removed,lolwho cares who that blue cheese smelling skank is mad at now nunes please ko her and send her off for good thanks
MMA,removed,hope this doesnt happen cause the announcers will be terrible happens with hockey playoffs on nbc because they arent required to use the team announcers
MMA,removed,rogan has been nothing but a glorified ronda nut hugger since she won the title fuck her
MMA,removed,glad i dont have dumbass friends who think hes not legit
MMA,removed,joe gonna lick that ass clean
MMA,removed,to me i never stopped being champion i lost that fight because of an accident i knew that i would win a rematch that i would be champion again its not my fault that hes such a he was never the champion i dont see myself losing to anyone in this division or any other division people will defend this retardation
MMA,removed,thats still sending thousands of fans who paid money to see him home empty handed just because he didnt want to fight a guy that probably wouldnt have beaten him on day notice pumped full of gorilla cum
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,hey lorenz ive been waiting to ask this question for a very very long time and im so thankful you are here to answer questions today tits or ass

MMA,removed,that thing you did with the porn stars was very charming
MMA,removed,have you ever shaked hands with conor mcgregor and if you had what did you thinking at the moment what did you feel in that moment
MMA,removed,unlikely till kelvin makes weight
MMA,removed,did you just assume conors gender shitlord
MMA,removed,gaaaaaaaaay
MMA,removed,conor has said yes to back to and defend both belts so stfu like you know the real truth
MMA,removed,oh look you hating on aldo once again shocking
MMA,removed,that cut on his cheek is still probably healing him fighting at was just more honey on the dick weve had in our mouths for a while now

MMA,removed,id hit that
MMA,removed,since the guy is pretty fucking far from being a pussy dipshits like the guy above should probably just keep their traps shut and do them instead of trying to call someone out like that from anonymity or is the guy that cage fights for a living really the pussy as opposed to some hamnegger sitting at his computer with his tiny balls in his hand
MMA,removed,you should have just stopped typing your username at elcuck
MMA,removed,i actually showed that its a thing against men if you understand why mighty mouse isnt a big thing its just that white knights like to protect women and paint them as victims
MMA,removed,protecting the minority then name a single instance in which a womans tv show group or forum limits themselves in order to appease to the minority of men participating
MMA,removed,because its your protection bullshit common to every white knight is the idea that men are agents and women are victims
MMA,removed,a big chunk of reddit disagrees with me and i cant have that iis what youve just said
MMA,removed,good thing an indian can teach those ignorant regressive white males whats progressivefuck off

MMA,removed,oliveira is a fucking piece of shit rofl gtfo
MMA,removed,but khabib is so robbed by conor and the ufc he wasnt even allowed to fight for two years because the ufc brass is afraid of him beating their champion
MMA,removed,because its a distasteful blend of editorializing and reporting they are distinct for a reason it bounces between here is what happened and here is the authors take on what happened far too fluidly you are allowed to do both its sometimes very challenging not to do both but the reader is to be informed plainly that this is the case flocombat largely does not operate under those principles it wasnt related to flocombat but a good example of this was the announcement a few days that michael bisping was injured and would not face jacare the title of that submission on reddit was michael bisping suddenly injured wont face jacare clearly designed to influence the readers opinion of the situation even before they read the context now the reader would likely have formed the same opinion as the title infers but thats not the place of an actual journalist
MMA,removed,oh fuck off
MMA,removed,check out when theres left in the tony was showing rda where and what he was going to hit him with

MMA,removed,after rousey lost for the first time anybody who had ever thrown a punch or a kick became a nightmare matchup for her at least for the casual fan the rest of us knew tates principle weakness was poor striking defense as highlighted against both kedzie and holm and in an older fight but against sarah kaufman nunes beating tate was impressive in its swiftness but not completely unexpected aside from rousey who demolished everyone but holm shes the type of fighter tate has had trouble with on the flip side rousey hasnt really struggled with striking versatility nor high level bjj she struggled with holms ability to create distance and strike precisely something many of us mentioned as a possibility before she even signed with the ufc oh and everybody say hello to monkeygifs who has been following me around all day because hes depressed and unemployed after washing out of the military with ptsd when somebody put a shoe in the clothes dryer at the barracks im sure hell have something to say here shortly or hell have deleted his comment history and then pretend he hasnt been following me you know how these kids are

MMA,removed,cool conor is still worth about times less than what floyd made off of one fight your boy needs floyd more than floyd needs conor conor will never touch what floyd has ever also when you take into consideration that people who buy boxing ppvs buy it for the main card and mma fans buy it for the whole card
MMA,removed,muslims gonna muz
MMA,removed,ronda has to come after us now anyone else imagining ronda in her underwear running after lingerieclad amanda and miesha and cat and the other girls hitting them softly with a pillow
MMA,removed,suck my dick guy

MMA,removed,stfu
MMA,removed,i would let hunto pin me down and gently slide his thick voracious looking stubble enhanced balls down my tongue only to be perched above my tonsils and kept warm like a mothers womb
MMA,removed,itt lol quit the thing that is ur passion cuz money lol
MMA,removed,yall are stuck in early its a new day better athletes are becoming fighters more competition than before fedor was a pioneer but he is not the goat hes up there but gsp jon jones are better all time silva and fedor are behind

MMA,removed,me volverÃ­a a comer el maÃ­z totalmente fuera de su mierda
MMA,removed,if he keeps losing shell ditch him rmgtow rtheredpill
MMA,removed,dude youre delusional im not a jbj fanboyi dont even personally like him but unlike you seem to be my judgement of a fighters merits are not proportionate to how far i wish their dick was up my ass im actually rooting against jones in his next fight but even though i dont personally like him it doesnt change the fact that hes a fucking beast of a fighter and better than fedor listen liverlips i never said that fedor got a short notice fight i said that crocops manager admitted to this happening on some fights then you got all excited ran with it like some sort of fucking autistic retard in a toy store funny how you dont even acknowledge the fighters who said that fights were actually fixed and admitted to it fedor was not winning the aa fight until that point you are a revisionist go watch the fight again and honestly tell me that fedor was winning that fight he was getting completely outstruck and only had a couple of moments where he looked good up until the finish so what if he dropped hendohe ended up unconscious just like aa did he lost the fight to a mw a mw who never held a ufc belt even when juicing he couldnt beat anderson or ramagebut he could knock the shit out of fedor i actually like fedor i think he is the hwy goatbut he also fought a lot of guys that werent even hwy like matt linland babalu haseman etc his fight win streak is speckled with questionable competition i mean how can you shit on jbj for cutting weight to fight smaller guys when fedor has wins over guys who arent even in his weight class but youre counting them into this decade of domination if youd like to have an actual discussion about opinions im completely open for it but if you just want to keep up the dipshit douchebag act then i guess well just have to agree to disagree
MMA,removed,not hating but rory has such a weak jawline i mean look at it on the right hand bar compared to thompson great fighter but that profile shot disgusts me
MMA,removed,yeah well he beat condit before condit got his shot never heard anyone complain there plus he was scheduled to fight big rigg who was the nr or contender but then big rigg didnt make the fight he still went and made weight so i actually believe he deserves the shot the reason he has not fought for years is actually because of big rigg and lawler taking time of after some hard fought title defenses imo its all good
MMA,removed,lmao fuck off
MMA,removed,you know every one of you omg its not faaaair autists would buy the ppv and love every second of it

MMA,removed,youre a retard
MMA,removed,you could just stream the previews i guess youre buying the ppv anyway so youre not really cheating the ufc out of money pm and ill show you how to get a good stream
MMA,removed,somewhere right now tony hinchcliffe is jacking off to this
MMA,removed,they might dump a black belt on him but anyone who has watched him grapple knows it would just be another publicity stunt but omg his coach is the first blackbelt in ireland well ireland has shit grapplers
MMA,removed,just a little more black paint away from being a less than ok costume
MMA,removed,i love tits as much as the next guy but these girls need to show some fucking respect keep the tits out but be creative with them harambe didnt die for such a low effort costume maybe if they bought a full body gorilla costume and cut the tits out of that id be fine but as it stands im sitting here fuming at my computer and ive already punched in walls from frustration
MMA,removed,the welsh can fuck off home
MMA,removed,nobody gave the fight to diaz round being a still doesnt mean diaz won the fight what makes round a is diaz being dropped twice hr tried to bait conor damn i didnt realise he was such a good actor that he had jelly legs and rolled his eyes back before falling if youre just going to discredit the fact that nate was knocked down twice i will point out that conor was in no real trouble at the end of the round he was rolling with most punches and didnt seem to be anywhere close to being finished that was just joe rogan hype tell me which judge gave diaz the fight i cant find one or is the maths too difficult for you conor clearly beat diaz fuck off with your weird obsession over my account
MMA,removed,i hope gsp is on the board that dude is intelligent and fair
MMA,removed,you forgot that part where ronda gets her skull beat in cries on ellen again kills herself before becoming a full browne
MMA,removed,with a name like cummo i doubt thats the only thing he drinks from his dick
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,well she also supports a presidential candidate that accepts millions from a country that smashes gay people to death with stones
MMA,removed,conor fights are always a mess the big difference is always the sources used people use the nate fight to show how good conors takedown defense is even though people who followed the sport a bit longer would know nate not a wrestler these obviously biased and uninformed arguments are pretty frustrating and then people jerk off saying how good the discussion is
MMA,removed,no we wouldnt stop lying bitch
MMA,removed,i just want to see that man fight again im done with all this bullshit what the dude does in the cage is unbelievable but his life choices are piss poor i dont think hes scum like most i just think he makes some bad moved but i feel like its the equivalent of people who got to watch the jordan era of basketball yet we sre missing it because his life choices its on my bucket list to see that man fight live and ill always root for him against all but one fighter
MMA,removed,get a bonus from gtbets
MMA,removed,my favourite part of this series has been the thumbnails
MMA,removed,every traveller video ever fuck off you junkies bastard gibberish while trying to think of the next thing to say because more than one thought at a time and or planning ahead confuses these guys you started it im going to finish it you might have beaten my cousinbrotherfather by cheating but im going to beat you like never before junkies bastard fecking bum ill see you on the insert date in insert city yus junkies bastard
MMA,removed,and for being a socialist
MMA,removed,scumbags always say this you say that about rape armed robberies murder battery until the other person is permanently incapacitated
MMA,removed,this is what happens when a narcissist gets brought down to earth she dominated womans mma but the competition wasnt that a great level back then she over shadowed every female fighter now not so much
MMA,removed,your saying jones was liked before the hit and run look at other fighters it has nothing to do with how you are outside the cage people just use that as ammo for their pre determined opinions
MMA,removed,she isnt even remotely pretty
MMA,removed,she looks like elon musk lmfao
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up already conor is right about these fighters just talking look at garbdrand he didnt whine about wanting a title shot he talked his shit and created interest for the fight and he got it dillashaw should see what max holloway is doing and just take out the contenders by until they have to give him the title fight plus im sure if cruz wins hes getting his rematch
MMA,removed,because you seem like a cunt a stupid one
MMA,removed,porn dont need to be a great actress nor be amazing looking just have to get that pie creamed

MMA,removed,seconds
MMA,removed,height does not equal weight stop bringing it up like a retard
MMA,removed,listen i have a very personal relationship with my lord and savior jesus christ very personal i met him three years ago at a bar in downtown reno i was hanging out with a few of my friends they were all getting shitfaced but unfortunately i was the designated driver so i was just sitting there sipping on a glass of ice water then this middle eastern guy takes a seat next to me do you wanna see a really cool trick he asked i wasnt sure if he was hitting on me or not but i was bored off my ass so i said sure then he snapped his fingers and my water turned into wine jesus christ i said he grinned and said yup thats my name and if you play your cards right youll be screaming it all night long you want to get into heaven you sexy little thing well let me put it this waythe only way to the father is through me im not gay so i was feeling pretty awkward but after a few shots of some holy spirits i started to loosen up and it dawned on me that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity i would become the first person in human history to bone jesus who could pass that up so i abandoned my friends and went back to his place he lit some candles and put on some christmas carols to set the mood after a few glasses of sacramental wine i was ready to go i tore his robes off and thrust my manhood inside him the feeling was incredible it was like fucking three people at the same time oh me he screamed in ecstasy i havent been nailed this hard since the crucifixion i blew my load pretty quickly but he wasnt done with me he bent me over and whispered are you ready to accept the body of christ he didnt even wait for answer he jammed his divine rod in my asshole and went to town i was surprised at how fast he camebut then again he hadnt gotten laid in years so i could see why well i thought he was finished he rolled me over on my back and said are you ready for the second coming and sprayed his holy seed all over my face may the lord have mercy on your soul
MMA,removed,making theyre way back thats not a typo thats not a spellcheck issue you legitimately do not know middle school level english your own language smh
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up me to you
MMA,removed,shinya aoki all day man
MMA,removed,oh fuck off
MMA,removed,thanks for the plug trump
MMA,removed,guaranteed you didnt bother to read the post and i guarantee youre still butt hurt about him shitting on your boyfriend ariel
MMA,removed,read the fucking article no where did he insult punk if this post rubs you the wrong way then its obvious that your still butt hurt from the ariel situation just admit it bud
MMA,removed,that post sounds mad to you im stating facts how about you grow up bud
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,he looks just like one of the kids boxing coaches at my club who just so happens to be rehabbing from a brainspinal injury from a car crash a few years ago he just started walking again months ago and finally built up the stamina strength to do some pad work a few days ago everyones very proud of him as soon enough he will be better than edmond lol
MMA,removed,she wants to the ufc is making her fight at that is literally the point of this all are you that incapable of realizing this no one gives a shit what cyborg whats there is no divison and there wont be didnt say she had no name outside of brazil i said you under estimate her attraction in brazil which is where she has been fighting for the promotion again are you to incompetent to see this she literally fought on the biggest card in brazileverand now a few short months later they have returned for her to headline an you are still trying to say she has no recognition they have literally given her a no name opponent and yet they still sell the card out on her name alone being big in brazil you are a draw aldo was a god but he pulled garbage numbers until he met mcgregor cyborg have no value outside of brazil get that through your tiny brain
MMA,removed,and your source is im seriously getting tired of nonswedes talking out of your asses about my country
MMA,removed,lol this should gain some traction here edmond slouching like mr cool guy with his arm around ronda rousey saying he could beat jose aldo ronda staring at him in a cock starved trance pure gold

MMA,removed,its all in the delivery my friend
MMA,removed,as i said he us a delusional moron but you are just as retardes if you seriously think cm fucking punk would have a chance vs him in a fight
MMA,removed,thats literally the comment that turned me against woodley at first i thought he was just a really skilled dimensional fighter now i think hes just a racist pavement ape posing as a man
MMA,removed,yeh i cant support racists like woodley tbh imo he should fk off back to liberia with the rest of the super proud american blacks who think themselves superior worked out real well for them too didnt it
MMA,removed,i never really saw any of this kinda stuff i dont have cable so all the fight i just watch online and stream them so i never got to see her personality traits or her cringe gym
MMA,removed,iirc rhondas demeanor changed drastically after training with the diaz bros did they fuck her into the gang and now she thinks shes a badass with a yard stare what really happened here is that rhonda realized that after losses for her team if edmond got beat by one of their guest coaches her whole team would lose confidence in him and that would send them down a spiral also if her coach got exposed for being less than elite it reflects on her
MMA,removed,lookey lookey what we have here dont you ever do this

MMA,removed,rather than completely accurate medical scales do you not think that perhaps that it might be wise to invest in a couple medical scales theyre rounding to keep fighters from being overweight and its obvious but hey if you want to believe them dont probe deeper even though theres proof its bullshit vs you make the decision if she missed weight or not the proof is there that these commissions are lying to keep fights together and not cost fighters money

MMA,removed,you might honestly be retarded na ppv buys x gate people arent fixated on north american ppv buys and gate receipts to please american fans its because thats where the money is compared to the few bucks the ufc earns from bt subscriptions and youtube sales at a pop to the few europeans who want to stay up until is literally a rounding error anyone with half a brain would have already understood that this was the case simply by paying attention to the timing of the events the fact that all ppv events run in the middle of the night in europe tells you exactly how important this market is to the ufcs bottom line
MMA,removed,what does it matter who nate lost to no one said nate was some untouchable pseudogod like youre implying get his mcnugget out of your mouth for a minute and realize that people can lose to anyone on any given night

MMA,removed,fools see what nate got by calling out conorthey see what cheal got by calling out anderson silva they think that if they cause a stir theyll get a chance to fight a famous fighter win and become a huge hit what they dont realize because theyre clearly delusional is you need to already be popular and have a stellar resume to be taken al all seriously when you say something like that both nate and chael were extremely respected and popular fighters before doing what they didwhat they did just made them even more popular these people think they can go from a zero to big time by doing this again because theyre stupid or delusional

MMA,removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikivoteridlaws the vast majority of nations do it but its only bad when america does right trump won the non college educated white vote with of the vote trump won almost every county in the rural upper south and appalachia which are as poverty stricken as inner cities and the black belt also those regions are predominately white and very poor especially appalachia its not harder for minorities to get a id every county in the usa has at least one dmv where you can get one and every dmv in every county is slow and bad not just ones in minority predominate counties if you are to stupid or lazy to go get a drivers license then thats your own fault and not the big bad scary white man its really a non issue because if you dont have a id you cant even function in modern society so that further weakens your idiotic argument

MMA,removed,fedor has second most top winsthat should answer that questionhe also did it in the most chaotic division
MMA,removed,okay okay here we go yall are killing me so muhammad ali is from kentucky he is from louisville kentucky it is our biggest city its still small kentucky has a really fucked up history abraham lincoln was from kentucky and he was obviously murdered for a reason i dont need to say why that dip shit mother fucker that started the confederacy was also from kentucky the worst battles of the civil war were fought here abraham lincoln said idgaf as long as i have kentucky yes kentucky had a star on the confederate flag but we never left the union we stood by our president it was brother against brother black against white and it was a really fucked up time it still is a really fucked up time here and it will be as long as ol gerbil head is the leader now we kentuckians are very proud passionate peoplefor good reason the rest of the country shits on us whatever blah blah blah chicken we gave you all ali we gave you all lincoln we gave you all johnny depp but apparently he isnt cool right now and neither is jennifer lawrence we gave you hunter s mother fucking thompson we gave you a lot of bourbon thats kentucky whiskey for you crazy foreigners fuck you jack daniels you suck and fuck your orange bullshit kentucky mother fucker what now some of you may wonder why the fuck is muhammad ali black with middle eastern sounding name we learn about muhammad mother fucking float like a butterfly sting like a bee ali from day in kindergarten because he was a bad ass mother fucker muhammad ali ran his mouth just like tyron was doing and he is a very very passionate person just like muhammad ali and for good reason he ran his mouth about race he ran his mouth about white people and he was a very controversial person he didnt care he kept running his mouth because what he had to say was important his birth name was not muhammad ali he was named after a white man and this white man was a pretty cool dude for the times his birth name was cassius cashus clay when he changed his name he called cassius clay his slave name from the white man the white man aaaaaand as an even bigger fuck you he converted to islam thus muhammad mother fucking ali was born kentucky is for kentucky and kentucky kicks ass we love our muhammad ali now i can tell you if muhammad was alive and well today he would get on here and tell you all to go fuck yourselves for treating tyron this way muhammad ali would not like you all at all muhammad ali was black he loved being black and black people needed that and they still do today thats why tyron woodley is running his mouth no other black people currently in the ufc has the balls to im glad tyron woodley is champion and running his black mouth mostly because it makes you all froth at the mouth and it is fucking hilarious now let me tell you a story about myself i grew up dirt fucking poor didnt have a god damn thing still dont i have very serious chronic health issues and oh boy as you know america doesnt have free health care sometimes i wish i could get on those damn boats that brought some of my ancestors over and tell them to turn back it gets betterforever from now but dont do that because then i wouldnt be here and america is all about running your mouth and changing things for the better for everyone at least it is supposed to be i grew up in shit shit shit shitty ass neighborhoods a lot of people called those neighborhoods the hood the ghetto white people would ask me what a little white girl was doing living down there and i didnt understand why who gives a shit what the fuck is that supposed to mean i got picked on a lot in school and i got the shit beat out of me at home by step dad i had no body teachers would tell me i brought it onto myself because back then bullying wasnt a thing people would treat me funny a lot of it being from adults and they were supposed to be my teachers and they were supposed to care about me and be there for me and they werent they would talk about my family run their mouths and always use my last name and i never understood why what did i do to deserve this they would blame all my problems on them i didnt get it there was this after school program i had to go to hated it didnt want to be at school didnt want to be there didnt want to be at home a lot of the kids there would laugh at me because i was poor mom had to buy my clothes from walmart other kids would see my clothes at walmart come to school make fun of me i was eight years old now one day at this after school program a new woman started and she was really cool and she had a really cool accent she was really nice to me even when the other kids teachers would laugh at me she said come here im going to tell you something about your last name your last name is irish i am irish from ireland do you know anything about ireland i told her no she would tell me little things about ireland every now and then and i loved it i would ask her to tell me more and more and she would ask me what i liked and i would tell her i liked fairies she said did you know fairies are irish like you i told her no we both loved robin williams she brought in hook for all the kids to watch and she said see that fairy thats tinkerbell youre tinkerbell and wed laugh and the other kids would get jealous lol i told her i loved halloween same thing march starts rolling around she asks if i know what st patricks day is i tell her no she says its irish and irish people are supposed to wear green on that day i asked her why and wellyou get this gist she told me to wear green every saint patricks day and be proud and dont be sad i wasnt allowed to be because irish people are strong she told me to read about ireland all the time and learn about what happened and why my family came here and be proud i always loved that woman but as i got older and didnt see her i thought she was full of shit google got really good so did the rest of the internet and i started reading about ireland and realizing what my broke ass family has in common with these people they all play fiddles and banjos and guitars and were always called hillbillies always looked down upon its called bluegrass music here my dads side of the family is bat shit crazy and for good reason and i love them more now that i know so i just bought another nate diaz shirt and in the comments i asked if they could make a green nate diaz shirt with him mean mugging and a crown on his head so i could wear it on st patricks day to wrap this story up i will always be forever grateful to that woman and the black people who invited me into their homes and fed me and loved me when other white people did not that woman taught me a lot of important lessons and so did a lot of other people i had a really tough time growing up still do due to my health life isnt always fair sometimes little people need you to stick up for them this is why i like controversial fighters this is why i dont like conor mcgregor you dont have to agree with me and thats fine but that woman helped teach me that the irish are strong and the irish are supposed to help out conor mcgregor does not do that conor mcgregor likes money above all else he does not use his position of power to help the little people to me personally conor mcgregor does not have big irish balls he has little irish grape nuts

MMA,removed,the only other option for me the maestro dong hyun kim vs marco el toro polo reyes
MMA,removed,far be it from me to submit multiple events but ufc ufc ufc
MMA,removed,stipe miocic beat of the greatest hws of all time in round kos or tkos became champion received bonus in each of those fight as well in comparison to conor and bisping stipes accomplishments wins were much more decisive against equally or more so tough competition
MMA,removed,stipe miocic three first round kos of three absolute legends of the sport one in their hometown one in his hometown wins the title and defends it
MMA,removed,conor vs nate

MMA,removed,cm punk vs mickey gall in a sense of worst mismatch in a long time even though i enjoyed seeing gall handle this newby so easily
MMA,removed,holly holm vs miesha tate round miesha with her back against the wall down on the scorecards and needing a finish hindsight being she needed a to draw she takes hollys back and submits her a moment where miesha finally recognizing she was the world champion where not too long ago she was contemplating retirement because she didnt believe she wasnt getting another title shot so i guess with what was on the line and what transpired this round was incredibly fascinating without it being a just bleed back n fourth war
MMA,removed,nunes vs tate
MMA,removed,cowboy hes had a active great transition up to and fought some and beat some tough competition
MMA,removed,conor mcgregor
MMA,removed,joanna champion

MMA,removed,if reebok was in charge of making a ufc trophy it would look like something a weaponized autist from made then promptly left out in the sun to melt it would have the wrong weight class would be labeled bellator kick brawling champion and then promptly posted to some farmer in a regional district of the southern philippines they would then charge the ufc for the honor of having outresourced it to some child labor camp in sri lanka

MMA,removed,conor mcgregor hes proved everybody wrong once again even coming back to correct his loss against diaz albeit at welterweight again but none the less has shown the work ethic to prove everybody wrong
MMA,removed,bad point to make she cant make with entire weeks notice thats fucking ridiculous she takes absolutely zero damage in her fights yet she cant have more than fight every months because she is such juiced up monster and needs to keep her precious weight advantage over the cans she crushes
MMA,removed,no stfu clickbait bum
MMA,removed,wow some autistic retard actually took the time to make this
MMA,removed,dillashaw v cruz had the story of the man coming to reclaim the belt he never lost vs the man that seemingly appeared to have replicated and improved on his style in dillashaw

MMA,removed,edgy moron at it again i see
MMA,removed,thats retarded anyone can distinguish north from south korean in contemporary terms they are literally called good and bad korea if northern ireland wasnt apart of the uk even less people would realize they are separate countries
MMA,removed,blocking you thank god i wont have to get messages from this idiot anymore youre an edgy moron shove punctuation up your ass
MMA,removed,valentina shevchenko i know she lost to the current champ earlier this year but her dominance over holm in a striking match has put her at the very top of this list for me
MMA,removed,swanson vs choi i know its the talk of the town because its recent but this was the best fight of the year lawler vs condit was also great but the decision was controversial and then ended up overshadowing the fight itself
MMA,removed,i am genuinely serious because i love my boy the great super sayain sage northcutt and feel betrayed by the rock
MMA,removed,its gotta be groovy lando the guy took the number contender to the limit on short notice and nearly won he then follows this up with a ko of the year contender these are the biggest statements you can make with the fewest fights
MMA,removed,melvin manhoef vs rafael carvalho boring rounds and a bad decision
MMA,removed,maybe once but dan has too much good pussy available to devote that many nuts to her

MMA,removed,fucking diaz fans with this shit already go back to your hole while your boys smoke weed and lose decisions
MMA,removed,sorry to rub in that your fanboy got his ass beat weird how diaz fans can dish out the shit but not take it back
MMA,removed,spoiler in the fucking thread title asshole thanks for screwing up the fight for me
MMA,removed,anyone saying this was robbery is an idiot extremely close fight and it was decided by takedowns also think conor landed a lot more brutal hits compared to nate but thats just me
MMA,removed,just fuck off dude
MMA,removed,you sum up everything that is wrong with mma fans
MMA,removed,shut up dickhead
MMA,removed,the adorable cholo and his leprechaun friend

MMA,removed,he probably lost money on nate lmao i hate people who come here just to bitch after an amazing fight the fight was close enough for people not to bitch about the winner and yet here he is
MMA,removed,fuck off you dont know what youre even saying
MMA,removed,rda did finish sparring with a broken foot ignorant fuck the real pain starts a couple hours after the foot breaks
MMA,removed,go to your post history and search for fake dont reply to me again you little spastic
MMA,removed,fuck off weirdo
MMA,removed,saying diaz won round is idiocy he got dropped multiple times the only round diaz won decisively was the id say the should have been because neither fighter did anything substantial the takedown with seconds left didnt mean shit but i can see how people would give it to diaz best case scenario for diaz he won rounds no way the was a connor didnt even go down
MMA,removed,salty
MMA,removed,delete more of your comments nutless fuck by averages im bigger stronger and more intelligent than you prove me wrong

MMA,removed,hey retard you gave away the winner in the title
MMA,removed,asshole fans of jj and conor they just want a circus and to get smashed they think ped use and outside they ring shit shows are awesome basically losers of life
MMA,removed,the us has something similar but it is still funny how both countries are more okay with graphic violence than harsh language

MMA,removed,he really needs to eat his shit or gtfo
MMA,removed,you said you were going to eat shit if it went to a decision it went to a decision youre not going to eat shit now so youre a liar
MMA,removed,ill upload the full hd version later on in the day so just hmu if you want it
MMA,removed,is there any way possible that i can watch the mcgregor vs diaz fight with a good quality instead of a stupid youtube video with no proper audio and shitty quality missed the fight because of different time zones
MMA,removed,walking him down was the opposite of what he should have done if he had actually taken advantage maybe he could have made something of it but instead he just sauntered over and flipped him off read on octagon control conor utterly dominated round won round with a pair of knockdowns and won round with potshots that nate had no answer for while he was wiping blood off his face scar tissue from not fighting migets in an unknown organization outside of the ufc conor was knocked down times nate was knocked down times knocked down and got up meanwhile conor was close to be finished multiple times in the fight diaz wasnt close fantastic fight well won by the victor welcome to watching mma by the way hope you stick around to the sport diaz won and welcome to common sense little leprechaun
MMA,removed,that sounds weird ive uploaded several full fights before that hit the top page without any warnings and also a ton of compilation vids
MMA,removed,dont waste your money its already online mmaversus
MMA,removed,absolute cancer here you go
MMA,removed,nick and nate smoke all of the time and thats allowed as long as its out of competition dont quote me on this but im thinking thats how it works
MMA,removed,pretty sure that he said this
MMA,removed,he has a bitchy demeanor tbh
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,how much did floyd mayweather get paid in his fight against manny
MMA,removed,ayyyy mcgregor with the gucci mane glasses king recognize king
MMA,removed,for real he had nothing but nice things to say for diaz didnt downplay anything pure class compared to how diaz carried himself after the first fight

MMA,removed,even though its a nice traditiontheme going with the caraway joke i think you couldve posted what it really was because ufc and western govs cant do shit about rutube russians doesnt respect their copyright bullshit anyhow thanks for the uploads
MMA,removed,you really spent money on the ppv when you could get a stream online for free lmao
MMA,removed,edgar didnt think he won round it was the other guy you stupid fuck
MMA,removed,conors strengths play right inot nates gimmicks what makes conor great is that he is not conservative as a fighter other fighters who fight nate are very conservative and fight him a certain way conor wont do this he wants to beat nate on his own terms conor beat himself in the first fight and looked worse than he should have in this fight for the same reason but still won the fight convincingly nate was also in both fights that is a totally different thing than most guys who fought nate conor is also moving up in weight which made him look worse
MMA,removed,guys i wouldnt listen to this guy he was supposed to eat his own shit and he fucking lied about it and keeps ducking
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,any decent torrent for the pm if needed
MMA,removed,his first ufc fight that he ended in seconds that which he mentioned
MMA,removed,wow youre still a salty little bitch almost hours later man you diaz kids really showed your true colors after this fight nate lucky diaz got the first one by a fault and when the fight actually keeps going conor dominates nates a great fighter and put on a true war but not quite good enough to beat a prepared mcgregor sorry you had to see reality and are still a whiney little brat
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,thats not even subjective all of them would be absolutely demolished by a onehanded diaz and mcgregor if you still think theyd lose after watching last night you are just a dense and stubborn motherfucker
MMA,removed,youre either a terrible troll or just challenged ive never heard of a hammerfirst are you referring to some sort of carpenters checklist go ahead go back and check yeah you made a typo too jackass dont you feel dumb now the hammerfist on the other hand is indeed devastating if it lands behind the ear on the lower half of the face or the bridge of the nose but the top of the head i doubt its pleasant but im willing to bet you the champion lulz couldnt kill a single ufc fighter with even hammerfists to the top of someones head gimme a break other than your hand of course
MMA,removed,so you call conor a wuss youre a punk looking to shit talk mcg whenever you can and thats something youve been doing for a long time leading up to the fight youre always a shit talker on this sub and j remember you rooting for diaz so yes im going to make sure to rub it in once or twice
MMA,removed,and youre a sore loser bum
MMA,removed,holy shit i cant even read through that comment you need to get punctuation in your life big guy ð³
MMA,removed,i missed that thats fucking hilarious
MMA,removed,sorry i couldnt resist i looked at your post history too and holy shit you know absolutely nothing about mma d you thats totally fine but dont act all cocky if everything coming straight outta your ass
MMA,removed,im a garbage fight fan because i believe that jon jones is a better fighter than dc
MMA,removed,i love how everytime someone does this kind of threads they always use bryan caraway ahhahaha
MMA,removed,thanks
MMA,removed,jones fought osp because dc was injured jones has easily proven himself as the best fighter in the division and could potentially be the best fighter ever jones has beaten dc already and ended dcs undefeated streak dc is much older than jones youre the one crying over shit that has nothing to do with mma ok you dont like jon jones personality why the fuck should that be a factor in a title shot jones deserves a chance to fight for the title he never lost calling me a shitty fight fan while youre crying over shit that has absolutely nothing to do with the sport whatsoever
MMA,removed,haha its a gif showing nate getting hit you seriously have to be a bit of a fuckwit to be offended by it
MMA,removed,you gonna do this for future fights
MMA,removed,if he popped positive hes banned for years and theres no issue if there was a mistake then he gets to have a rematch man i like johnson just as much as you especially after that ko but he lost decisively to dc already and id rather see jon jones fight because hes more skilled if johnson gets his shot before jj i wouldnt even care as long as jones gets to fight for his belt whether it be dc or rumble
MMA,removed,lolno way they were going to let diaz have a decision win it was a finish or a mcfaggot decision
MMA,removed,wow you are one ignorant sack of shit them getting ppv points is ppv what the fuck is your problem
MMA,removed,this night looks miserable
MMA,removed,okay douche we get itbut running in fighting doesnt mean the same as it does in real life if you claim a fighter was running the whole fight you are saying hes avoiding the action and running away from his opponent connor clearly didnt do that for more than seconds at a time to reset himself
MMA,removed,youre a pathetic hater now leave the sub and dont come back
MMA,removed,bahahahah look who is it making the shitposts hahahahaha
MMA,removed,rogan had an interesting comment about that recounting what dominic cruz said about how conors style as it is doesnt lend itself well to round fights he conor is so explosive in his movements and strikes that its extremely draining past a certain point its like one of those top fuel drag cars they go in secs but can only last for about secslike your dad
MMA,removed,typical irish retard go make a country that isnt a shithole full of racist terrorists
MMA,removed,because is a douchebag with a very clear agenda look at his post history he is just very salty and cant handle a mcg win
MMA,removed,almost finished him lol stfu dude he did not almost finish him in the second
MMA,removed,this is just a code word for saying i dont give a fuck about racism your comment has validity if it were about a tumblr sjw making big deal about nothing this is just hate filled vitrol against an individual because of his race
MMA,removed,well we dont know what race the cornermen are and only white people can be racist so its not necessarily racist lololololol
MMA,removed,no they shouldnt be fined and expelled from cornering wtf
MMA,removed,i still cant believe people are calling conor out for running to get distance to reset himself
MMA,removed,you win imaginary points at the oppression olympics for doing so one day when the world has gone full retard you can cash them in for pussy and a side helping of sti from the nearest sexually liberated whalemonster who uses an overabundance of base pleasures such as food sex and denying accountability by claiming victimhood to cover up the ever increasing depression that they just cant shake off
MMA,removed,i dont care if you read it child enjoy poverty
MMA,removed,lol i love this guy winning just to make all the sensitive sallies mad now
MMA,removed,fuck off back to the stone age
MMA,removed,hes got nothing for you cant even open his motherfucking eyes lol its funny to type out
MMA,removed,i have it on good authority that this all just bantz you just dont understand the culture
MMA,removed,he basically raped nate in the first rounds so much that even if he had lost the fight he would still have been the way better fighter exactly the same as the first fight but keep it salty
MMA,removed,god damn it cruz is so fucking good i get a technique boner every time he fights
MMA,removed,would have
MMA,removed,knockdowns does not equal easy round i think connor winn out it was a tie i wanted diaz to win fuck yourself with your pathetic assumptions you made a dumb statement about how knockdowns auto wins a round it doesnt
MMA,removed,cruz has got being a closeted gay man issues he should just put on a pair of rainbow shorts and stop being so ashamed of it it would be inspiring for people to see that there is a gay ufc champ
MMA,removed,youre a dork these are fucking corner men not politicians they were assholes for it they get a talking to from the ufc to watch their mouth they move on expelling them from their fucking job they use to support themselves and family so you can jerk off to the feeling of justice is pathetic get a fucking life
MMA,removed,the fuck you on about i have no interest in boxing but were talking about the implications of letting fighters choose their next opponent learn to read jackass
MMA,removed,too bad you cant vote for trump being a foreigner and all doesnt matter hes going to lose in spectacular fashion regardless and your triggered pc crying sjw hysteria ideology is going to get another nail in its coffin
MMA,removed,what a naive little edgelord you are exit your bubble please
MMA,removed,i wouldnt assume they were a homophobe then youd be a moron
MMA,removed,no thats not a separate discussion your halfbaked naive assertion wouldnt make it that far he cant even open his eyes lol is not a neutral observation you triggered edgelord
MMA,removed,yeah by not giving him points just like i said s why the fuck are conor nuthuggers such sensitive divas lol
MMA,removed,awsomeones insecure theyre skinnyfat
MMA,removed,yeah im saying he won it by not getting points great logic there youre a fucking genius
MMA,removed,eah im saying he won it by not getting points great logic there youre a genius
MMA,removed,lol you went to his facebook specifically looking for something to make you feel outraged
MMA,removed,literally holocaust
MMA,removed,what are you its still marijuana regardless of the level on cbd or thc if anything its the cbd that would help someone in a fight not the thc
MMA,removed,you get a gold star for bravery
MMA,removed,biggest disappointment of my night
MMA,removed,its called stalling which i would give a point to the other fighter in my own little judging world not like an actual point but it takes away from how im judging that round
MMA,removed,you calling someone an idiot is golden you realize you just said neither of the diaz brothers were any good right you are the idiot
MMA,removed,its hard to have sympathy especially since asians are notoriously racist against black people in america and in ever asian country
MMA,removed,nah i just think youre dumb either that or you dont know what the word permission means though i guess thatd make you dumb as well
MMA,removed,wooooo
MMA,removed,who cares they make fun of the other dude big deal its a fucking fight people thats what you do bunch of sjws on here need slappin
MMA,removed,that fucking commentator is a pussy fuck him
MMA,removed,but the majority of us live outside the us and we arent such nationalistic assholes about what sport we think should be popular or not its a real shame that all americans get stereotyped as cunt nuggets like you that probably havent left there own state let alone seen the rest of the world
MMA,removed,seeing the look in his eyes as he began to walk out dissipated any of my thoughts about him coming in with a poor mindset it was crazy he looked fierce while looking totally calm and focused
MMA,removed,respect the decision and move on fuck off you cunts they just got robbed of a bronze medal in the olympics because they were celebrating a victory id be pissed off too
MMA,removed,what happened did uncle dana pressure mods to have the links deleted lol
MMA,removed,how can you be such a fucktard eyepokes really a better equivalent is using your weight to lean on someone and avoid their strikes aka what nate did
MMA,removed,as if they were cities wholly of such types of people rather than nuke cities in inexorable states of poverty and crime youd rather destroy prosperous cities of people you dont like i think you might be the stupid one friend
MMA,removed,lol asians are racist against blacks so now this incident is cool why are there always a couple of you morons layin in the cut just waiting to pop out with this stupid shit ive had black people do racist shit towards me but im not dumb enough to put that on all black people or celebrate things that happen to other black people wise the fuck up idiots
MMA,removed,thats not the only good things about those cities at all you sound like a fucking idiot los angeles is the bjj capital of america and arguably the world dallas and miami are not worthless cities just stop stupid
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up check the punch stats after you blindly watch the fight
MMA,removed,sure but no need to flat out disrespect someone with chode like antics
MMA,removed,monkeys like to swarm
MMA,removed,pretty much hes a goddamned retard but the circlejerk here is real
MMA,removed,off
MMA,removed,i cant handle your stupidity im done have a good day
MMA,removed,fuck yourself for posting the same shit as everyone else i hope everyone downvotes these posts
MMA,removed,naive regarding what dont use words you dont understand i am being presumptuous if anything but how can one not be as there was no answers given in bjs statement bj issued a statement to the world regarding the iv if he was sick that would have been a clean natural excuse there is literally no other plausible scenario where someone totally against ivs uses an iv mid camp next time if you post on reddit add something to the conversation as opposed to posting an insult which doesnt even apply you are beyond an idiot
MMA,removed,rmmastreams will have a link around kick off time
MMA,removed,she always gave off the vibe that she was a good fuck this just proves it if youre down to throw some punches youre definitely not afraid of gagging on a cock
MMA,removed,she just posted the other day that she will never date white men so it is save to assume the entire hood been up in that
MMA,removed,these comments are fucked up regardless of whether or not palhares is a bad guy the rules for mma should not be compromised it is completely wrong that all the comments in here have the attitude well we shouldnt follow the rules because he deserves it the rules enforced in an mma matchup should be consistent regardless of who is fighting if you think its ok for bad guys to be fouled then youre not a fan of the sport
MMA,removed,you sound salty mad aldo got decimated in less than seconds by a superior fighter

MMA,removed,youre a dipshit
MMA,removed,rmmastreams perhaps
MMA,removed,rmmastreams
MMA,removed,my god i didnt think it was tito talking at first he sounds so much more intelligent here seeing this video and comparing it to recent press conferences fucking drives home the impact concussions have had on tito i want to see him fight but shit man watch that press conference right before watching a recent tito speech and watching tito fight again seems gross the man is killing his brain
MMA,removed,use vlc and copypaste this into medianetwork stream
MMA,removed,that thread can probably help you out
MMA,removed,uexporiental saying that mma fans saw rashad as the uppity black guy isnt nearly as egregious as youre making it out to be it absolutely is black athletes have been established and loved by white fans for decades now even genuine racists are more able to accept black athletes than black people they may encounter in real life you would have to look far and wide to find a fan rooting against an mma fighter because hes black or more upset with his trash talk because hes black and if you asked mma fans why they didnt like rashad most of them would probably not say its because he was black but implicit racial bias is a thing what the fucking fuck is this people are now racist without even knowing it if i say i hate floyd mayweather because hes a bad person its really because hes black youre ignorant youre truly honestly ignorant
MMA,removed,goodbye nice free stream hello shitty potato stream
MMA,removed,despite the close of the stream cody bollingervs henry corrales taking place now seems like they could at least the stream run silent mmajunkiejohn disappointing
MMA,removed,arrrrrr
MMA,removed,where can we watch illegally
MMA,removed,no its the opposite you keep saying offensive things not realizing theyre offensive you think i dont understand what youre saying but i understand it very well look no one is saying that all mma fans are racist but theres certainly that portion to it maybe they dont hate black people but they certainly treat black athletes differently perhaps a black trash talker is hated more than a white trash talker perhaps people might tune in to watch a cocky black fighter lose more often than a cocky white fighter maybe people just unknowingly root for the white fighter over the black fighter again no one is saying that these people are out joining the kkk but theres certainly a racial bias going on thats what you and exporiental have been saying for an hour now and yes it is both ignorant and offensive there is no difference between the way black fighters and white fighters are treated by the fans fans constantly root for black fighters over white fighters and fans constantly cheer on trash talking black fighters mma fans are probably less racist than the general population by a good amount
MMA,removed,resource my inbox please thanks

MMA,removed,are you insane he beat dhk carlos condit josh koscheck and kelvin losing only to rory all top fighters conor went with a perennial gatekeeper and very beatable nate diaz in what universe is beating top fighters doing less than conor getting a title shot for beating denis siver of all people oh wow he predicted the rounds who cares what does that even mean he predicted he would end nate diaz in the first round too and what happened to that did i say conor dodged edgar did i say that anywhere in my post whos delusional now he didnt fight edgar and he should have he did not deserve a title shot after barely getting by nate you know how many fighters have beaten the shit out of nate diaz you are grossly underestimating frankie edgar if you think that only thing he would have done to conor is wrestle him on top of that frankie has taken down every single fighter he has ever faced including benson henderson who outweighed him by a significant margin he would have problems taking down conor conor also has a very serious gas tank problem which would be easily exploitable by frankie but well never know because he refuses to defend his belt
MMA,removed,fucking stupid lesbian
MMA,removed,people always say this shit after a non ufc fight im not surprised why would they throw a fight for tito whos retiring and an unapologetic trump supporter for someone they have under contract for more fights it would make no business sense for them to throw it in titos favour for a min segment where he gets a proper sendoff
MMA,removed,watch sonnens defence of the choke you only need to tap to an rnc once in your life to immediately see how fake that shit was just quoting another one of your comments to point out to other people that you dont have any idea what youre talking about either
MMA,removed,can she take that right hand nut
MMA,removed,just saw this what do you all think in regards to the fight being fixed
MMA,removed,watch this video fix was in
MMA,removed,fixed fight
MMA,removed,you see its bc my dad beat my mom and myself and treated us like shit till he died i havent seen that side of my family since i miss my cousins and sisters i was also bullied throughout high school for struggling with multiple undiagnosed mental disorders trying to understand why my mom would date a bum who beats her while she makes a year while he never works and spends money on drugsalcohol this women who got pregnant at and finished school while working on the fucking side doesnt have the strength to tell this douchebag to go fuck himself the best part is that my mom isnt even ugly she has high well defined fucking cheekbones and a fucking ass of the gods and my dad was an ugly douchebag drug addicted fuck that used to insult me for looking like her as a child i was thinking thank god

MMA,removed,also tito tapped at one point shit vid but you get the part
MMA,removed,tito could have defeated anyone tonight he is rejuvenated with high energy from trump becoming president ask any trump supporter how they feel right now we are walking on air
MMA,removed,i disagree they threw a few strikes right at the beginning that looked like they were both looking for damage did you watch the same fight as me yeah the fight was short but they were both going after it
MMA,removed,chael doesnt do anything right while defending that choke and he wasnt rocked
MMA,removed,the brain muscles get u sum boi
MMA,removed,oh fuck off chael insulted his ex for doing porn some things you cant just sweep under the rug because it was fight promotion tito was giving chael a chance to apologise he didnt they both move on with their lives nothing douchey about it

MMA,removed,ahe got on the mid day unemployed feminist circuit and drummed up huge interest ufc mekbourne was a completly different crowd to normal packed with full kitted out dykes in team rousey gear
MMA,removed,youre a dipshit of fights dont have weapons involved
MMA,removed,youre clueless as fuck kiddo upper back rounding is normal and acceptable when deadlifting i already know you dont lift because you called it a max attempt
MMA,removed,again not a fan of chael still think it looks fishy find a new horse to beat because that ones dead and buried
MMA,removed,khabib has snapped his knee on many ocassion but tony is the real retard when it comes to training here
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,are you studying broscience upper back rounding is acceptable and his deadlift form is acceptable as well you can paste all the webmd info you want but there is not evidence to support your argument and plenty of deadlifters using this technique
MMA,removed,you literally said not to bad for injury risk yes it is bye troll
MMA,removed,everyone claiming the fight is fixed is an idiot especially you tito is extremely strong it was clear chael could not get out his head was as purple as my aunt estbers nipples nobody that has actually grappled is claiming fix for a reason
MMA,removed,fuck off ishii never hurt nobody and the rampage decision was bad
MMA,removed,tito ortiz tapped

MMA,removed,die cis scum
MMA,removed,nice try but i do environmental remediation and i have a bachelor of science i love when you social justice cult members start cantevening
MMA,removed,by racist bullshit you mean the iq tests that show differences in average intelligence between different races you cant argue against the facts so you insult the messenger unfortunately for you even in the current year organizations like the college board accidentally let it slip that race is more of a determining factor in sat scores than socioeconomic background long story short yes a monumentally influential scientist was blackballed for talking about real facts that hurt the feelings of intelectual midgets such as yourself

MMA,removed,cyborg can go fuck herself either shed off some muscle mass or shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,she also used steroids and cuts her tits off to make weight
MMA,removed,yeah well the best dont take steroids either cyborg so shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,this comment hits it right on the head of the clit penis i think some people just want to make a sjw stand or some shit when at the end of the day we are talking about fucking pounds i understand cyborg wanting and deserving a payday but it seems the other girls can make
MMA,removed,she was champ you dumb loser
MMA,removed,you and the majority of mma fans are also incorrect i also like how you used the idea that the judges are bad as proof that the scoring was wrong and the judges are therefore bad you circularreasoning motherfucker different judges slip in for each fight anyways
MMA,removed,i dont really care what youre opinion on rondas behavior is because thats not really what im talking about here ronda actually fought top fighters and didnt take any steroids were talking about cyborg calling out someone whos been inactive after beating meh fighters stay on topic you goon
MMA,removed,stop being so mean to cyborg about her weight even if she cut the penis off that she grew from taking all those roids she still couldnt make its not her fault she eats the calories and does the exercises to maintain the mass that she has that isnt something she can control and how many years has it been since she started calling out and how many catchweight fights has she had to get her down not nearly enough its really unfair that everyone doesnt just bend over backwards to create a whole division just for her why isnt everyone clamoring to cater to her needs yeah you know why racism
MMA,removed,no dummy he took a dive he took a shot and went down
MMA,removed,yeah well its not your fucking poem

MMA,removed,sounds retarded
MMA,removed,currently on it or not testosterone permanently alters your body one of the first steps to a female to male transition is to begin a regiment of taking excessive testosterone eventually your clitoris becomes a penis and you gain muscle mass where you normally wouldnt because of this i will never take cyborg seriously as a legit fighter not gonna lie either with the ufc trying to clean up its image a bit regarding this subject having someone like cyborg on contract is a joke this may not be the nicest thing to say but she is a fucking creature and she doesnt deserve a spot in the ufc
MMA,removed,ill downvote you bitch
MMA,removed,i hate how everyone has reacted to her if not for ronda wmma wouldnt be anywhere near this popular

MMA,removed,are you freaking kidding me ive been the one arguing from the beginning that anything is possible but its unlikely im the only one arguing that the other side is possible its just not likely ive said that three or four times and the only person to have done so this is all the while people arguing my point were getting downvoted to hell and then slowly as im posting the voting gets flipped to where my posts those defending it were getting all the upvotes and my detractors were getting downvoted but youll notice i never even brough that up because the voting in this subreddit is stupid as hell so i sure as hell wont bank on it just because i switched the momentum you havent even read my posts youre arguing my point as i said more than once the whole reason im calling everyone retarded is because the guy was arguing a fair point the one that frankly is more likely than not and gets bombarded by people insulting his reading skills and everything else it was hilariously stupid that so many people went there especially when in my and many peoples opinion were wrong so they deserved to be called on it its like youre arguing against someone totally different than me because the things youre trying to use to call my stance objectively foolish are the exact things im actually arguing again you freaking people jesus this sub

MMA,removed,i hope ronda loses and retires from mma and goes have fat and ugly babies with travis in a secluded mountain house somewhere and i hope her fans cry at how fat and ugly her babies are
MMA,removed,except for we both know in reality thats not true you guys are mad that i said that conor mcgregor is racist youd never walk around in public shaming german nationals as nazis or slandering every hispanic person as a cholo you are just mad that i pointed out that someone who you fantasize about did it be honest with yourself man lying to me for a day old circlejerk is just fuckin pathetic

MMA,removed,im the idiot really thank you i understand why you may think its irrelevant here but i believe that if the others ones are allowed these should be to i also apologize for that stupid racist joke i figured the frickin and the fact that it was stupid on its own made it clear that it was tougne in cheek but i realize now that even if you did know it was a joke it would still be retarted icant even begin to tell you how ignorant you are more than that i cant help but think what a shame it is that someone actually took the valuable time out of their lives to teach a hillbilly piece of shit like you how to read fuck yourself
MMA,removed,fair enough would buy a ufc pass to watch it but staying up til doesnt sound that appealing usually just watch crap quality streams of the fights instead
MMA,removed,hey hitler

MMA,removed,about what he talked trash and lost lots of people have had promising starts to their career and lost when they stepped up in competition but none of them managed to get measurable number of people to say i actually want to see bryan caraway win this one no need to get emotional that is objectively his most impressive accomplishment in mma
MMA,removed,mccall doesnt cut nearly the same weight do you not understand how much bigger justin would be like if you dont get it i dont really know what to say to you after a week of cutting he didnt even get close its not like he wasnt trying reports from his camp are that he literally had to stop for his health the dude cut as much as possible and wasnt even close he would have been substantially bigger than ian who spent an entire camp expecting to make the legally contractual weight thats why hewouldnt fight him ok big guy this is such ridiculous reasoning what weight is the cut off why doesnt he just fight a welterweight the real question to this conversation is why are you being so aggressively ignorant about this did ian fuck your sister plenty of reasons to dislike him but hes not the guy who spouts off about being the toughest man in the division wholl fight cain tomorrow if the fans want it
MMA,removed,no fucktard they are the same issue he didnt fight because you didnt make the fucking weight no need to apologize that shit happens but dont be a pussy and blame him for your short comings also arguing on twitter with fans makes you look like a straight bitch
MMA,removed,most of the time you see fighters theyre training or walking into a fight with no makeup or hair styling or frazzled and sweaty after having a fight if you put any woman in those conditions similar to first waking up in the morning it takes a few points off them most of them arent my cup of tea either but are you saying you cant see why anyone would be attracted to a very athleticfit female just because she doesnt have a model face lets see of the hambeasts youve shacked up with for comparison
MMA,removed,just watching some jj footage for research
MMA,removed,but if you cant get over some nonsense a year old wrote on twitter somethings going on with you not sterling lol you say that with the inflection like hes some young buck not a decade past average highschool graduation age
MMA,removed,my brain hurts from reading that retarded rambling first of all you dont get the point theres a reason unranked guys dont get shots at the title mma skill is gauged through consistent performance ie ranking system you could make the argument that whitley didnt deserve the shot in the first place and therefore couldnt possibly deserve the title secondly its a sport it exists for my entertainment predicting outcomes and explaining them is part of what makes it entertaining
MMA,removed,my guess is that it looks something like
MMA,removed,rretardsinaction
MMA,removed,yeah but you arent a manlet
MMA,removed,aaaahahahahahah fuck off idiot mighty mouse would destroy of all human beings with ease
MMA,removed,this entire comment chain is pretty pathetic there are alot of idiot fanboys in this sub who only understand fanboy logic their rational is that dana is cool because he gave a fan like them something for free they dont really care that even ufc contenders who were promised title shots like tj grant are forced to leave and become miners to survive financially he was a contender in in the most stacked division lightweight and he left the sport during a period of injury to work a crappy mining job
MMA,removed,fuck off take the fight or fuck off
MMA,removed,thats literally worse than rape
MMA,removed,wtf thats just retarded not watching the fight because youre sure hes gonna win is literally the dumbest thing i think ive ever read on here but anyways im almost certain hell win people talk about nates chin and talk about how hes only lost once by ko well you know who else was known for having a granite chin and only losing once by ko robbie lawler and he just got knocked dead
MMA,removed,yeah well youre clearly an idiot so
MMA,removed,oh yeah hes afraid to fight wondergirl but hes down to fight the greatest of all time stfu
MMA,removed,yeah there are websites like sherdog and so many others that tell the results of fight cards keep track of the records of fighters etc why would people pm you that info this is just crass attention whoring what you need is real good people that care about you not random internet strangers that you share a superficial hobby with one of my former next door neighbors i learned he even the guy was only apparently he developed bad friends who introduced him to heorin
MMA,removed,conor was winning until he wasnt stfu
MMA,removed,i actually updated my reddit post to show the guy has apparently been using reddit to sling heroin likely to other redditors as recently as days ago but dont worry i am sure escapists millenials like you will massively side with him and against me because i dared write against escapism one of your most sacred values
MMA,removed,not trying to be an asshole shits on op because he is an asshole on reddit

MMA,removed,whas da what he doesnt even speak like that you mong
MMA,removed,i agree with utranypanda and to an extent unikolasv who knows if this person was using days ago today could be the day that changes good for him but rmma is not the place for this kind of post he could have easily just said hey guys i really enjoy mma and this community some personal stuff came up that i have to go deal with ill be missing some fights and would appreciate it very much if anyone could update me now and again about fights or something like that was there a need to put his opiate abuse or what it has done to his life in the post no there are subreddits specifically for addiction support and mental support maybe he felt comfortable in this sub and felt ok enough to open up here doesnt fly with me like i said there are dedicated subs for support and hell get support in rehab you dont know you dont know what opiates are like man oh i dont ive been using them for five years i bow before the mighty oc i give thanks to the h i worship the dilly its hurt my life in many ways as well ive been to support groups na meetings rehab etc i do know the feeling of being lost to substances and wanting support or just to know youre not alone but there are places sites call lines community resources etc set up exactly for that reason rmma is not one of those

MMA,removed,and still talks like everybody owes him something did you even watch the video lol he specifically said he doesnt even care and doesnt even need anything from the ufc but if they make him an offer he cant refuse then he would that is the opposite of thinking he is owed something it is amazing gregs cock is so far down your throat that you take the hate to this level but i guess it makes sense if youre shit country has never accomplished anything of note you gotta defend what you have
MMA,removed,nick chasing anderson and all of his opponents around the ring is the opposite of tentative hitting and running is the formula to beat both diaz brothers

MMA,removed,because the ufc is the only relevant top tier mma organization in existence everyone else is not even in the same galaxy as the ufc you started the debate about qualification for pro mma not i you cant decide to change to only the ufc because i am debunking your points i was referring to other professional sports leagues such as the nbamlbnflnhl the likes of which the ufc aspires to be compared to lately i might not have been explicit enough but i was never trying to compare them in the same light as bellator or other regional shows as you keep trying to do what has kimbos fight experience got to do with non combat sports once again you started the pro mma qualification debate not i dont pretend what ufc didnt give him the time of day until he had success outside of the ufc its all out there for your to read if you like google dana ignoring brock piss off with the pretending im in peoples heads bullshit im not stating anything controversial dont pretend exactly what i said that you know why brock did what he did so first you were saying it was so he could test himself now you are claiming its so he could get the ufcs attention which one is it that last sentence is a perfect example of an ad hominem you dont have to directly insult someone to try and attack there character sorry fighting and getting paid ie pro mma by a regional organization is not the same as fighting for the ufc youre the one trying to talk about pro mma i am and always have been talking about the ufc once again you started the pro mma qualification debate not i if you merely said ufc my response would have been very different youre right it doesnt i agree but at least he has some combat relevant experience that he spent many years developing his skills outside of wrestling are atrocious but the talent pool was so shallow in that division that it didnt matter its hard to argue that needed more training seeing as he became the champ of the division what is needed is better talent and bigger salaries to attract them this does not mean he was not severely underqualified it is relevant because he was fighting ufc caliber opponents the ufc didnt bring in rank amateurs exclusively for him to fight maybe you will understand with an analogy its like poker you cant base your actions of the result as you do not know the result prior hindsight is because if the talent pool is extremely shallow the overall experience needed to be considered competitive is obviously going to be lower and consequently harder for them to find fights outside of the biggest organization correct although this alone does not qualify him good work trying to constantly shoehorn him in even though hes completely irrelevant to the discussion of the ufc bringing in amateurs regardless of that even he has far more tangible experience than cm punk once again we are speaking of pro mma not the ufc also the topic was not were they more experienced than cm punk its were they qualified for pro mma keep dodging im sure youve got a massive list of controversial ufc fighters with negligible prior experience its not hyperbole he has zero experience in anything that would give him qualifications while all the others have at the very least some you may dislike kimbo but his credentials arent even remotely controversial the guy made a name for himself fighting in backyards which realistically isnt that far off from a crappy regional show once you debunk the almost dozen points i have made i will happily compile a list you have shown you can not have an intelligent discussion by delving into hyperbole and ad hominems why would i waste my time compiling a list that you are not going to take seriously once again we are speaking of pro mma not ufc the hyperbole as i made very clear in my response was the infinitely more experienced quip we are speaking of experience which he has the second he spars for second not pro mma fight time thank you for agreeing that his internet fame got him into tuf what ad hominems i didnt take a single personal shot at you im well beyond the point of being interested in a debate rmma is just about the worst place to try and have a logical debate bunch of irrational nut huggers that downvote anything that isnt the flavor of the week the first paragraph of your last comment you dont need a personal shot to try and attack someones character my bad thought you might be a rational adult but you are admitting you just want to talk some shit and let of some steam go for a run start training a martial art or beat your dick its much more stress relieving

MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,so how did he magically dominate cerrone while he was the most tested fighter in the division does cerrone suck lawler also took his game to another level does that mean he is a cheater rda became a beast right around the emerson fight in that fight we saw muay thai skills from rda that we never really saw a whole lot of before that was also the first fight where he used those vicious leg kicks so beautifully refining his muay thai and wrestling skills and combining it with his already world class bjj is what made him into such a monster steroids dont magically teach you these techniques that emerson fight happened when he was also and in case you didnt know fighters actually dont hit a ceiling when they are they actually tend to get better so why dont you go fuck yourself instead of just talking shit
MMA,removed,well they need to get punched or something to adjust their attitude its pitiful
MMA,removed,i think you might be trolling or retarded no one liked gastelums chances going up in weight and i went with him i got in my parlay so either listening to the dick riding sub got me pretty close to a pay off or maybe i just went with my own gut and liked choi as an up and comer i didnt know what was going to happen and neither did you thats why calling the fights beforehand is fun we all have different hunches over who we think will be better on the night and putting some money on your guy is a good way to have bragging rights over your mates when it comes in god i cant believe the other user had to explain the concept of betting to your retarded ass
MMA,removed,his fat isnt consuming calories you dolt the muscle however does the fact you got upvoted tells me theres a bunch of other people in this sub with invalid opinions

MMA,removed,love that youre getting downvoted for common sense when did rmma suddenly become a fucking aldo shrine oh yeah when conner made him irrelevant
MMA,removed,its sad how you cant understand that the ufc is an exclusive club that hungry fighters want to get into and that a precondition of entering that club is to agree that you can be terminated at any time so what youre basically saying is that every ufc fighter is stupid if thats the case why the fuck are you here its sad how you cant understand that you only started talking about an agreed contract after you proclaimed without conditions that fighters are compensated when they are released from their contracts and that statement was patently false and i proved it to be so with a citation and then you squirmed and weaseled and tried to quantify it with contract talk after the fact and now youre calling me sad youre the sad one its not a reflection of your character to be wrong about something or to misspeak it is a reflection of your arrogance to insist that you were right all along when you werent its fine if you meant to say it better you could just say that instead of continuing to insist that im stupid or sad because i couldnt understand the deeper missing context in your incredibly simplistic and authoritative statement its your responsibility to express yourself in a clear and coherent manner if you want people to take you seriously especially when youre making an authoritative statement in an argument such as they get compensated for it when they dont
MMA,removed,ugly dyke amanda nunes
MMA,removed,i really want to see khabib v mcgregor but if we cant get that this is the next best thing i certainly prefer it to the weird khabib v aldo plan no disrespect to aldo but that fight doesnt intrigue me as much as the other two plus i want to aldo v holloway thats really what i think as to who is right on the contract dispute issue not really my concern i am only chiming in because i think some of the posts in these threads are perplexing i dont really care about buyrates or salaries or any of that shit i love movies i could give a fuck how much the actors involved make or what won the box office i think all those discussions are kind of the least interesting things to talk about in terms of movies i kind of feel the same way about mma but i get that its all part of it so my two cents while i generally side with fighters on this one it seems to me that ferguson is in the wrong i think the major x factor was until today the question of when this contract was negotiated if it was truly very recently i think it makes sense for the ufc to expect ferguson to honour it if it was something entered into in like and is now verily out of whack with the market i think it makes sense for ferguson to get a renegotiation the reason i think the contract issue was rendered kind of moot today is because of the news from the mma hour that ferguson a few weeks ago was willing to take this fight at his contract rate when it looked like the fight would be in january that didnt happen then they offered the same fight against the same opponent for march and suddenly the money isnt fair for the same thing nothing pertinent has changed between weeks ago and now so essentially the ask for a renegotiation makes no sense to me now cause ferguson isnt really asking to renegotiate a contract he entered into whenever in or or even hes asking to renegotiate terms that were sufficient a few weeks ago during which weeks nothing pertinent has changed that makes no sense its like when there was a rumour that ultimately nothing came of that nate diaz wanted more money for mcgregor at then he had agreed to when the fight was made for like its the same fight a few weeks later why are we risking a great fight over this you already agreed to terms the fight is just going to be a few weeks later did you just change your mind add to that the fact that fergusons ask seems to be predicated on khabibs contract which is bullshit your value is your value and your deal is your deal and it seems to be based on the incomplete record that ferguson is in the wrong here on balance of probabilities but ultimately i could give a fuck i generally want fighters to get paid plus i stream everything illegally so i probably dont even have standing to complain either way plus i think there are more interesting mma discussions to be had and mostly i want to see some good fights lets get on with it
MMA,removed,relative to boxers who only box the best strikers in mma sure you can say it sucks the fact is ronda already destroyed alexis davis and bethe correia two girls that had never ever been beaten like that in mma if ronda sucks then the girls she beats are less than shit considering ronda beat them all in less than a round total adding up all their fight times besides miesha

MMA,removed,yeah i was gonna say you cant hate a person who you go to war with for minutes no matter how much shit you both talked before the fight a lot of that is for hype anyways and im sure they both know this part of it is just real shit and you legit just fought for minutes what more can you do to settle a beef the one thing you do see happen though is that as more time passes you start to see each guy start to take verbal jabs at each other like i know nate will talk shit on conor every now and again but then hell give an interview where he gives him credit for what hes done and says hed try and do the same shit if the ufc gave him the opportunity because much like his brother nate knowsthinks that the ufc is out to get him and fuck him overnot give him the credit he deserves thats why they gave him that fight on short notice cause they thought he would lose could you argue that they chose him over a few other guys who wanted that fight and he probably never fights conor without that chance no you cant fuck you bitch

MMA,removed,id pay for it and i always stream the ppvs for free Â¯ãÂ¯ i do already pay for fight pass though
MMA,removed,yeah this im european and i never bought ppv mainly because im a student and im broke so i stream it
MMA,removed,yeah like an average polish viewer is going to pay for it while they can watch it for free online they all watched it on some random free live streams and the actualy number is much bigger
MMA,removed,the polish guys i work with were my go to free fight stream finders before i got bt sport ireland im sure more than found a way to watch it

MMA,removed,id drink her piss mate
MMA,removed,shut your mouth
MMA,removed,deal with it only americans are a willing to spend that much money and b stupid enough to not know how to pirate to watch ppv shows its for a hours event on tv which is not even guaranteed to be good ppv model is close to death and wwe realized it and paved the way to the new model and wwe ppvs were even more of a guaranteed value than ufc ppvs was a good ppv but you need to go back to to find the previous good ppv ufc to ranged from meh to sucked absolute dicks the ufc just need to copy the wwe put ppv on fight pass but still keep some exclusive contents like cards fox cards on tv most illegal streams are low quality and torrent is obviously not live but for for hours people are willing to deal with the low quality to save the money for a month many people will be willing to spend that much to watch in hd instead of yes pirates with keep pirating but a month is enough to convert some pirates too i pirated wwe for like years to be fair there was no way to watch wwe live or rebroadcast on tv in my country but as soon as wwe network was made available in my country i happily gave them the money right now i got free well minimal cable fee ufc ppvs on but the us cards are not available on tv here so i pay for fight pass because those cards are available on fight pass here point is is couch money hours is not i lived in some of the most expensive cities in developed countries us france finland and is still food money for a whole week you cant possibly expect even poorer countries like brazil russia etc to spend that on a possibly shitty hour show on tv just doesnt make sense

MMA,removed,they cant even open their fucking eyes
MMA,removed,are you dumb or something well of course searching cm punk twitter on google will give u cmpunk on twitter please dont be an idiot and read what i said

MMA,removed,love watching him fight the few times that happens his religion threat was a little much for me didnt come across well from a guy whos religion is an embarrassment to the world
MMA,removed,i dont know how to say this but i hope his girlfriend miscarries so he can keep fighting
MMA,removed,also more people upvote than downvote often two things can have positive score that say opposing things
MMA,removed,getting dominated for mins says a lot more than beating someone with the first punch of the fight lmao
MMA,removed,if you cant see how bragging about what school you go to makes you look like an ass then maybe youre not so educated
MMA,removed,the judo this year is awesomeso much agressive face stomping i like judo a lot but man it seems so rough on the joints

MMA,removed,her being a cunt wasnt a poor editing job
MMA,removed,better pack eight lunches you cocksusckas
MMA,removed,suck my dick ya fuck
MMA,removed,do you jerkoff to your own nut hugging narrative his opponent rolled off the couch five days before the fight taking bong rips and drinking beer mcgregor ended up on the ground and was begging the ref for a stand up he didnt overcome adversity all it showed was that he had huge flaws in his game such as having zero ground game when there are punches being thrown at him and knowing nothing on the bottom
MMA,removed,funny vid if it dont get all over your face then you dont belong in this place wtf when did ufc become a glory hole to avoid copyright takedown detune the prefight audio higher detune fight commentary lower crop the video frame tighter add the white glare stripe in the middle

MMA,removed,putin is a murderous totalitarian thug who embezzled his fortune through corruption coercion and violence he is linked to crimes across the world and will do anything to maintain and expand his power even relative to other evil leaders he stands out as a shining success
MMA,removed,the always upvoted typical rmma comment which makes it sound like thousands of people have the exact same opinion fuck off
MMA,removed,great argument how about this counter no they shouldnt period the other sports leagues can afford to do that and other benefits because they have way more money oh the ufc is worth a completely inflated billon the nfl makes billion a year in their tv deals alone before a single ticket is sold shoo youre out of your league

MMA,removed,come here and find out ya cunt
MMA,removed,unzips
MMA,removed,thanks for the post these are some great posters id really wish the ufc would make posters like this and exercise their artistry and creativity instead of just making the same old monotonous shitty posters showing the fighters in poses over and over again with ufc posters you always know what to expect but with these it was precisely the opposite and you were always pleasantly surprised
MMA,removed,the americans gave trump the office for years i think its a sacrifice big enough
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,definitely defiant is how educated people feel in relation to trump
MMA,removed,shes a she
MMA,removed,trump vs putin in the cage so everyone else dont have to risk their life for stupidity

MMA,removed,upvotes at this time you plus fucks should be banned from watching or let one of these fighters you complain about kick you just once in the upper leg im sick of the lack of intelligence on this sub im posting in defense of the fighters you all worship in victory yet knock down when their bodies fail to be at and arent comfortable putting their careers on the line ban me i dont care show your true colors rmma
MMA,removed,no intention to be rude but you said a lot of stuff to say nothing its all baseless conjecture and speculation the fact of that matter is that dan henderson used trt for over half a decade he is just as guilty as vitor

MMA,removed,ehh fuck offwhu
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up cunt
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up he has a different opinion
MMA,removed,im on vacation outside us permanently and honestly because of region blocking the best option is just to google the fight and stream it i used to buy ppvs through fight pass but honestly it is just too hard when i cannot even view fight pass only events or by ppvs through ufc platform this would be something that needs a deep look from the ufc brass
MMA,removed,that might just be cus chinese people are half retarded
MMA,removed,a lot of people in this thread need to get lives
MMA,removed,that sounds like a pathetic day
MMA,removed,if i think about it really the more i think about it the more pathetic it sounds you consider that a pretty great day that is so fucking sad all that means is that you have really low standards for a great day bottom line is you do fucking pathetic things and live life like a loser to the rest of normal society youre a fucking pathetic person with a pathetic life just because you want to do them doesnt change that fact youre the kind of person normal people with actual good lives make fun of
MMA,removed,i spend the whole day looking for them illegal streams cus im a broke collge boy that cant afford ppv dana would call me a goof and probably say something along the lines of thats fucking illegal
MMA,removed,culture that accepts retarded shit as the normretarded

MMA,removed,channel all the testosterone of fighters in the card and fuck or masturbate
MMA,removed,i dont think hes in any kinda shape to be getting married
MMA,removed,apparently not scared or shook lol the nuthuggers think he looked as confident as ever
MMA,removed,wasnt scarred or shook just liked like it acted like it carried himself like it fought like it reacted like it interviewed like it turned the rematch like it did you all forget that he went to instagram calling conor out before the scheduled rda fight but then turned down the fight after rda was injured if calling for the fight and then turning it down isnt being scared what is
MMA,removed,because hes a petty feminine bitch
MMA,removed,jon jones did the same thing to chael and jon was the one with the full camp you think jones was scared of chael lol use your fucking head aldo taking that fight on that notice couldve been the end of his title contention forever
MMA,removed,its pretty easy to find streams to most ppv considering btsports shows it in the uk just check rmmastreams around the time the prelims start
MMA,removed,both are overrated and treated too highly by the autistics on this sub i enjoy seeing people say bad things about robin ill enjoy the inevitable turn on ariel when it happens also
MMA,removed,did you know there is something called streaming and people use the power of the internet to illegally show the fight live if you use a new website called googlecom you should be able to find a live stream of the fight if that fails try staying off rmma or any social media websites that would post results and find one of the hundreds of sites that will post the entire ppv right after its over
MMA,removed,huh you cant be that retarded reread your comment think about it for a lil while delete it and post something different anything even just smash your face on the keyboard and make that your comment it would be less retarded than that dumb shit you actually put thought in to
MMA,removed,rmmastreams

MMA,removed,always bugged me when people said miesha was better looking miesha has an ass and has showed some skin but she still looks like a mean substitute teacher ronda is blonde nicer face by far and at weigh ins i guess i havent seen much of her otherwise aside from fights has the better body people always shat on her looks until they gushed over her during prime appeal and i didnt get it one way or the other shes an okay looking girl who at her best looks pretty hot
MMA,removed,lol people get so offended when you disagree with the smallest shit on here i appreciate your response though haha i can see how miesha would look like that mean pretty girl the one who probably would make you feel bad for trying to talk to her but everyone wants to fuck anyway but that look isnt my thing i know she isnt like that anyway though she seems like a sweetheart

MMA,removed,killin the union game
MMA,removed,man this is such an unfair statement her cut to was about as extreme as any fighter has ever done and thats not hyperbole it was insane id never want her to do that ever again is the lowest she should go so if you want her to comfortably make like she makes is not comfortable at all she would have to lose lbs of mass losing of mass while still maintaining peak athletic ability is a lot harder than saying oh just cut the protein and weight lifting and youll lose weight before you know it really her team and the ufc should stop dangling this carrot the entire thing is just insanity

MMA,removed,no absolutely not thats because i watch other sports real sports in real sports aka not ufcwwe which is all you lot watch injuries are not an excuse to dodge fighters that you fear the way aldo has
MMA,removed,maybe nate came in heavier than his usual self as well he wouldnt have gassed at
MMA,removed,sshhh you only can pray our lord god mcgregor or you get downvoted is a hidden secret on our fanboy community sshhhhh
MMA,removed,and what about when he goes to the ground and tap in seconds was that fight years ago and you can downvote this like you always do with a comment that is not about sucking mcgregors dick fucking fanboys

MMA,removed,shes been struggling with suicide since her loss someone should tell her there are easier ways to get away from edmond
MMA,removed,biology and sexual dimorphism are just social constructs of the patriarchy shitlord

MMA,removed,are you playing retarded or actually retarded
MMA,removed,fuck off hes literally a once in a lifetime athlete whose undefeated youre hoping he misses more time for what reason
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,dont expect smart people in mcgregor threads keep in mind most of his fans are brand new to the sport they have no idea what athletic commissions are or how they work classic example is how people are claiming mcgregor is worth too much money to the new york state ac despite having absolutely no idea how much money the ac gets from mcgregor
MMA,removed,sometimes people make it so easy to decide who to block
MMA,removed,bisping spent like a decade telling critics he actually had ko power he then spent finally actually believing in it himself and hurting people with punches now he is going a step too far though
MMA,removed,thanks for your non addition to the conversation
MMA,removed,thanks again for your non addition to the conversation youre on a roll
MMA,removed,im confused why this sub is taking sides in this conor starts actually throwing shit at other people at a press event and he gets sanctioned with arguably too big of a fine for doing it who the fuck cares conors a multimillionaire and nevada are idiots instead everyone here seems to be riding conors nuts and acting like he should just be able to do whatever he wants in the nhl another sport with fighting hed be off for the season and have a gigantic fine its bizarre how people are taking sides between idiots with a banhammer and idiots with millions of dollars in the bank theyre all still idiots
MMA,removed,kailin curranid drag my balls through an alcoholic aids victims broken beer bottle just to smell the exhaust fumes of the van that takes her dirty knickers to the laundry
MMA,removed,again go watch the fight or rewatch it whatever its not commendable that he wasnt finished because he wasnt remotely at threat of being finished at any point in the fight for fucks sake
MMA,removed,rmmastreams
MMA,removed,truth hurts for you people that do know shit lol eg nate diaz not having a competitive fight with michael johnson characterized by his usual taunts you guys either dont watch these fights or are too thick to remember them nate diaz taunted his way to a dominant victory just like how he tried to taunt his way out the asswhooping of a lifetime against rda idiots i swear
MMA,removed,everybody should down vote this garbage post and poster gtfo wthis shit post
MMA,removed,yeah bruh these dudes are retarded they actually think an outclassing occurred because thats what theyve been told its rough out here for honest people like me who actually report facts bruh

MMA,removed,honestly if youre going to attack a guy and he just drops to the ground every time you should be allowed to do whatever the fuck you want stomp his face even i dont give a fuck
MMA,removed,bull fucking shit if youre allowed to flop like a seal every seconds and throw upkicks every seconds then you should be allowed to stomp
MMA,removed,how you could dislike a guy because he figured out an orthodox winning strategy is beyond me you all should be praising hall this sport isnt about carnage its about skill if you call hall a pusspy youre a simpleton who cant appreciate a good fighter when you see one they complained the same way about the gracies when they came in idiots who said it wasnt real fighting stop you morons halls victory is more than deserved he won it that bout in spades and he did it with a strange style thats awesome
MMA,removed,i love it skank hunt
MMA,removed,hall is smarter than that and if you didnt know just ask him interview on tuf basically saying hes the smartest one around and everyone is an idiot
MMA,removed,hope moreno fucks benoits dirty asshole in front of everyone

MMA,removed,such a cop out lol making it seem like the only reason aj got knocked out i can practically hear the gus nuthuggers scoffing as they read knocked out and thinking to themselves nuuh it was a tko duh was bc rumble was listening and not at all bc he read gus body language most fighters say they cant really hear anything bc its so loud so they focus on the voices from their corner so im not buying that nonsense but whatever makes the nuthuggers not cry themselves to sleep on their alexander gustafsson shaped pillows
MMA,removed,you so dumb

MMA,removed,rmmastreams
MMA,removed,they usually put up a thread on rmmastreams a hour or so before the show
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,let me touch her ass

MMA,removed,its called adoption or artificial insemination dipshit
MMA,removed,is there not a reddit stream at least
MMA,removed,dont worry cyborg got her covered
MMA,removed,for those interested in rewatching it
MMA,removed,people have a hard time with this its pretty simple they just rub their fur burgers together a bunch of times until one of the gets pregnant
MMA,removed,come on man you know if someone is carrying a baby its the petite girlfriend even then theyre both fighters so why not adopt then it wouldnt interrupt either career
MMA,removed,when two gay men have sex how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other persons penis
MMA,removed,you just have to smoosh the vaginas together
MMA,removed,could be worse they are airing a bellator card in australia today months old todays card will be aired in march probably force me to stream illegally
MMA,removed,ââð¶
MMA,removed,ari is trumps longtime hollywood agent ive heard stories about the two of them i bet trump is a partial owner of the ufc now
MMA,removed,i i kinda wanna be that needle right now
MMA,removed,there is a subreddit called mmastreams
MMA,removed,where do you see me saying it was just because he was black do you have any familiarity with the history of combat sports in the united states have you heard of muhammad ali this is a well established trope and the fact that youre pretending it doesnt exist is laughable nowhere have i posited that the only reason for it was because he was black but his being black compounded it and made him into a figure similar to though clearly not on the same level ali your accusations reveal far more about you than anyone youre talking about you really need to give this shit a rest trying to spin this around on me is some seriously pathetic deflection
MMA,removed,i hope so should be no lagging on the streams are you on the football special and crisps to tonight
MMA,removed,i wont share links on this sub but if you add the word streams to rmma there might be some people that will help you oh and the prelims are free on sherdog
MMA,removed,they agree to only foreplay but tito put his finger up danas ass while he was distracted
MMA,removed,cannot fullscreen it though
MMA,removed,butt stuff
MMA,removed,you could try a free american proxy but i dont know how the speeds will be on a free proxy could get a paid one and itd be able to stream that no problem for like or less
MMA,removed,yeah rmmastreams is also always an option
MMA,removed,im not a liberal also its youre i said i just hope hes being paid what he deserves capitalism exists and thats why bellator could offer him more money but cowboy cares more about the belt and staying in the ufc for the fans so actually this has nothing to do with capitalism the pay and the fans are a part of fighting in the ufc theyre part of the nonmonetary compensation cerrone gets which like all jobs can affect what one is willing to accept as a salary thus if he is happy at his current salary then he is presumably getting paid what he deserves yet you seem to think he isnt and the reason why he might not be is because the market isnt competitive and thats because capitalism doesnt always have competitive markets and thus some people get screwed relatively speaking
MMA,removed,thats a good one but he is actually just a douchebag
MMA,removed,why do you even bother to read or respond if you dont care sounds kinda dumb to me who fuckin cares what you think talk and read about something else or shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,all that dancing she did tightened that ass
MMA,removed,kek
MMA,removed,u hav dads lol my parents always said i was a miracle
MMA,removed,mcgregor fans ladies and gentlemen
MMA,removed,you act like nate knees buckled when he got hit he got stunned and stumbled backward far from a clean knockdown
MMA,removed,so more ad hominem with zero facts saying i dont know anything after ive presented you with like four paragraphs of betting odds past opponents and so forth all meanwhile youre just sticking to literally calling me stupid all in all im just pointing out that the talent pool aldo is in and the lower weight classes generally are much less deep than in higher weights this is generally accepted as fact these divisions are later additions to the ufc chronologically speaking theyre literally younger divisions yet when i bring up that aldo was a king of the division hes in almost as long as the division hes in has actually existed and that there is a real possibility it takes time for the talent to saturate there people like you get buttmad but i can see that you dont have anything on your side except crickets thanks for making reddit a shittier place with your mindless posting
MMA,removed,it was the fifthbest fight since ufc signed on with fox in not the best ever and would have done most likely overpassed any rousey card i think its safe to say conor is the ufcs most popular fighter
MMA,removed,rocksalt could do so much better oh well i guess her vagina his gateway to sweeter hollywood pussy
MMA,removed,lol says someone whos so clearly on mcgregors dick
MMA,removed,they would have spent hours and hours on foreplay getting herself wet enough just so she can take it i can just imagine her begging for it with luke barely able to force it past the knob and lovato moaning and squirming demanding him to force it in deeper she would have orgasmd within seconds of taking the entire length being filled and stretched right up to her cervix the orgasm would have been powerful with her vaginal muscles clamping down on lukes throbbing monstrosity her whole body quivering in euphoria
MMA,removed,nah she good
MMA,removed,whoever thinks nate was even pounds heavier is a fucktard
MMA,removed,im from the area mike perry is from he is a classic stereotype of the common wiggermouth breather native to central florida i heard him speak once and already know him intimately lol
MMA,removed,coming from a fighter please stfu you know nothing
MMA,removed,on the first pic is is that a wet spot
MMA,removed,obviously this spoiled little bitch has never had to get a normal job in her life so she has nothing to complain about
MMA,removed,i would fuck her
MMA,removed,i mean the concept of bonein dick measurement is usually restricted to areas on the internet such as in which people regularly call each other autists in an ambivalent manner and i thought our conversation was also happening within that kind of context
MMA,removed,uicritcal i would fuck her pls
MMA,removed,jumping in the air literally head first probably doesnt help
MMA,removed,if the olympics have taught me anything a guy in a combat sport named islam is bad news

MMA,removed,nate is exactly same size as rory and nick exactly feet tall inch reach he said himself he feels faster stronger and better overall at ww in ufc press conference conor haters on reddit are getting out of control shut the fuck up and give the man credit he deserves
MMA,removed,your grammar its horrible do you even engrish

MMA,removed,i hated that dude so much when he said that i half wished they would feed him to mighty mouse
MMA,removed,um no im thinking hed serve better as a jesus camp leader
MMA,removed,thats not how it works dumb dumb the person who makes the claim has to back it up why would i look for something i know doesnt exist you obviously already looked for it and couldnt find it thats why you linked to a tweet from john and didnt actually read it before posting it as your source since it doesnt say shit about what youre claming go watch khabib vs horcher look at how few punches khabib threw from standing almost every punch from him was from the gorund and lets see how much significant strikes he landedaccording to your rules it shouldnt be much youre wrong get over it either provide proof or just shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,tj was probably one of the worst training partners of all time no matter who you were he said we have a lot of kids that are years old â they love mma and just want to train with a teammate they pay for it and its the experience you also get some serious fighters that come and train would spar with the kids that were there just to have fun and learn and be part of an experience and he would beat the living sht out of them â like till theyre crying on the mat and im like what the fck are you doing man just chill out these arent the people to be beating up on right now thats just the person he was

MMA,removed,no need to tell people that you dont know shit
MMA,removed,its not gay if its in a three way woodley just offering wonderboy a chance at a more friendly competition
MMA,removed,well seeing as cyborg still has two x chromosomes
MMA,removed,what the fuck ever this is a plant and has been used thousands of years what would make it any more scientific by having a doctor observe that no one died same thing with cannabis it has been used for thousands of years but all of a sudden we need to do research on it first just forget the thousand of years of recorded evidence for it who cares about clinic trials when these drugs still get approved and still kill people directly or indirectly you are saying since morphine has passed clinical trials that it is safer than kratom since we have no studies done on it gtfo here that is the dumbest post you also forget that big pharm cares more about the profits than healing so of course a lot of these pills get approved with horrible side effects which are way worse than kratom but thanks for being a schmuck
MMA,removed,conors fake as fuck not a real surprise there only the wwe idiots buy into his schtick
MMA,removed,so youre saying that fighters who have never interacted with conor should tell us how conor behaves take a second and realize why thats impossible he runs away scared youd need to have a word with yourself never said that he does every fighter has said that backstage he just disappears and stays with his pr people you arent dating conor you dont need to white knight for him
MMA,removed,well the title is pretty self explanatory who gives an fuck lol bunch of reddit dorks and internet morons
MMA,removed,dennis you are a disgusting fool who supports animal abuse for momentary pleasure please die
MMA,removed,but he couldnt make weight so he called in to reschedule it at then at did you make this part up
MMA,removed,i cant believe you would say that mcgregor has a harder time cutting pounds when hes already lean than hendricks cutting with chub dickhead s
MMA,removed,httpthewatchseriesto search the ultimate fighter shhhhhh
MMA,removed,what an asshole for being smart about his career lol you idiots think he has to prove something to you the guy wants to be champ and make money he doesnt care what some losers on reddit think while hes got his piles of cash and miesha tate
MMA,removed,wish that coked out harambe wasnt the image for this
MMA,removed,anyone free to help aldo pick up his toys he keeps throwing them out of his pram

MMA,removed,here we are to save the day
MMA,removed,biggest whiner in mma
MMA,removed,i dont need proof lmao she was caught using anabolic steroids which gave her the physique she has you got a crush on her giant clit or something and god knows how long she was doing it before you prolly think it was a one time thing lol
MMA,removed,how exactly are you coming to that conclusion based on how butthurt you are lol
MMA,removed,fuck jones fuck conner theyre setting back what legitimacy the sport had garnered over the years because their idiotic fanbase
MMA,removed,but it is true that he went to bjj to get a burrito after class the fuck is wrong with you man i say one true thing about a fighter and you launch into a socioeconomic debate fuck off
MMA,removed,i am here to watch the ultimate fighter not the ultimate bussinessman fuck off
MMA,removed,redditor for years only started posting about mma recently posts only about conor and posts to wwf subs ahahahahahahah
MMA,removed,if you call that a contribution then youre part of the problem youre probably one of those people that post shit on fb like omg im seriously so done
MMA,removed,just because you follow someone doesnt make you a fan i have seen every one of his fights and dont really care for him either way i just watch a lot of mma
MMA,removed,you dont need to search his post history you just need to subscribe to this sub or rsquaredcircle and youll come across his endless mcgregor ball washing regularly
MMA,removed,you should stop trying to instigate mudslinging really doesnt help your case
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up woodley youre the champion what else do you want dude
MMA,removed,oh man that would be fucking amazing cue hordes of people on rmma calling woodley a racist terrorist
MMA,removed,his picture captions since he joined the mcgregor camp have been very cringy other than that tho kids a beast
MMA,removed,theres a big difference between being just a fan and spouting the kind of retarded nonsense he does on a regular basis
MMA,removed,how is this any different than every other entertainment genre out there the vast majority of people are going to gravitate towards the big stars yes a lot of women who got into mma in the last few years werent hardcore mma fans they were rousey fans why do you care so goddamn much some of them will find they like the sport for what it is and some of them will just cheer on the person they like who cares you say the mcgregor circlejerk is obnoxious but to me personally the holier than thou purist selfmasturbation takes the cake congratulations youre better than of the people that support this goddamn industry stop jerking yourself off about it
MMA,removed,i mean id be pretty pissed too if i got the wrong noodles
MMA,removed,yea convinent how i just proved that mcgregor prob gets max of what he brings in and i asked you how you being a true fan gives you any more credence than anyone else that is a tunes into watch ufc fights you help build it from the ground up you took care of their lawyer fees you an mma fighter trying to hype to the sport you hosting events you making sure all these events can see the light day with all the government regulations in place thats what true fans do not your pretentious grade bs
MMA,removed,i wonder how many times he told her though
MMA,removed,gtfo

MMA,removed,yea i was ripped like that when i was
MMA,removed,hahahaha im going to disregard what you said because i saw its not easier to land a punch than a head kick that statement alone is fucking autistic you realise he uses the same combinations and strikes because no one hes faced can stop them he hasnt needed to do anything else youre going to see the best cody garbrandt this fight and mark me words youre going to feel like an idiot after saturday good day sir tips fedora
MMA,removed,how is that salty
MMA,removed,barnetts a cheating piece of shit and very few will ever tell you differently the difference in comments is because barnetts not whining and crying about his weight cut and trying to guilt people into letting him fight much smaller opponents that old shitbird cyborg wants to paint herself as a victim and keep using her ill gotten size to dominate fuck her and anybody who defends her
MMA,removed,its still a matter of opinion who should have won are you years old do you really have to state the obvious we all know what the record is look at hendricks vs pierre hendricks definitely won that fight but somehow they gave it to pierre it was a robbery so on record hendricks lost but everyone knows its was a terrible call
MMA,removed,im not mad at dat ass tho daymn my googli moogli
MMA,removed,just dont comment on what you dont understand it was his opinion hes allowed to post his opinion i dont think thats been banned yet
MMA,removed,wow you posted this just to hate on him what a fucking freak
MMA,removed,sorry doc illuminate us with your deep knowledge about the human body just kidding no one cares
MMA,removed,she has the glutes of a proper dominatrix her glutes can crush any dick that dares rip her asshole
MMA,removed,jeez how sad
MMA,removed,you are very right but remember that dana is a trump supporter and may very well have a negative view of the lgbt community he pushed back like crazy against even having a womans division until he saw the dollar signs
MMA,removed,sometimes i feel like this sub has a bunch of fucking retards with shitty ass comprehension critical thinking skills
MMA,removed,mlady

MMA,removed,pure bbc genetics
MMA,removed,i guess its gonna be red boxer brief night at nunes house
MMA,removed,khabib is an absolute noname to any casual fan and as far as i know those dirt poor russians arent buying pay per views
MMA,removed,holy shit dude your just nitpicking now
MMA,removed,the only reason hes been around this long is because he proved he was loyal to dana being good friends with dana unfortunately doesnt guarantee a job anymore in the wme era
MMA,removed,its nice having mma jim not spam posting here was he banned or something
MMA,removed,gilbert is one of nate diazs closed friends and nate said that no one on his team uses gear but guess who popped lmao cmon fuck off with this b b b b b b but he said bullshit i edited it in a few seconds after i posted it so its not that big of a deal lmao if i had edited it in after you replied it would have been three minutes later and a little asterisk would be next to my comment you simply dislike the man to the point that you will deny reality sad really omg the irony
MMA,removed,hundred percent
MMA,removed,youre the man buzz we appreciate youre hard work on this sub
MMA,removed,so just like the average rmma guy rmma isnt perfect but there are some people who know what theyre talking about theyre not the majority but theyre here if you read the comments
MMA,removed,yeah aids is a motherfucker
MMA,removed,training with parillo that cunts done taking all of bjs money then eh fucking sycophantic yesman dipshit
MMA,removed,tldr gsp is a greaser and was probably on roids throughout his career he was only successful because he was the poster boy of mma so they let a shit load of stuff fly
MMA,removed,dat ass tho
MMA,removed,dat ass
MMA,removed,you couldnt be further than the truth if you were banging your sister lying to yourself while you were reborn as pinocchio thanks for trying to insult the people that died for your freedom asshole
MMA,removed,thats because you are all filthy fucking assholes and are an embarrassment to this sport jesus christ that is embarrassing you think you are going to respond and say it is satire but that is not a good excuse
MMA,removed,actully its endearing that youd go after a spelling mistake know what hes taking if he is on something you have idea of the quality and cost of them its still an expense vs taking nothing youre retarded for two reasons first it was you who claimed it was expensive i claimed you had no idea what he was taking and correctly assumed youve no idea about actual prices of common cycles thus you cant know if its expensive second everything is expensive against nothing congratulations there yep you totally missed the point no i didnt people dont chastise others for the laws of other countries hes taking it recreationally as do millions of others worldwide and as long as he does them abroad there is zero trouble moreover even if he buys them abroad and takes them where theyre illegal no one bothers to go after him still what exactly are you implying anyway that people are going to criticize him for being on the juicy for promotions when hes not even competing thats delusional this is just straight up ignorant youre ignorant the vast majority of sports fans have no clue about drug enhancement nor would they tell apart users and non users also your assumption that people will think hes always used if he uses now is completely baseless youre spinning up drama in your head and he does care about it since he released a whole statement saying he didnt retire because of drug allegations this is completely beside the point he cares about allegations that he juiced during competition i said he doesnt care about allegations that hes juicing post retirement do you even go to the gym that is an obtainable physique without drugs perhaps to a full time natural body builder not to an mma fighter the guy retired months ago moreover hes and i trust you know how natural testosterone production progresses over the years lastly the problem with reddit is people such as yourself who make a bunch of assumptions about everyone else in order to try and validate themselves if you didnt have your head so far up your ass you would have realized what i criticized was your retarded reasoning around postretirement steroid use i never made any assertion about whether cro cop was using or not
MMA,removed,did you like just start watching mma like months ago wtf are you talking about how can you put anycof those threebin the top middle weights of all time luke hasnt defended his belt even once yet romero has never done anything worth a damn and neither has jacare anderson was undefeted for years had title defenses a fight win streak and kod light heavyweights you sir are a fuckin noronbif you think rockhold jacare and romeros careers compare to silvas
MMA,removed,fighting the best holds the title cant wait for him to smash faber we both know he will keep hugging on fabers nuts though
MMA,removed,he might be the biggest asshole in martial arts ever he needs to have his legarmhead ripped off so he cant fight ever again
MMA,removed,nah i mean outclass outbox and outwrestle them which he does to all his opponents the results back that up
MMA,removed,dickhead
MMA,removed,god damn that ass
MMA,removed,if you are and lb you would be a fat fuck everyone would notice

MMA,removed,dude what are you talking about tyron woodley is the ufcs thiccweight champ
MMA,removed,i wanna root for wonderboy so bad but according to woodley wonderboy fans are the same thing as kkk members so cant
MMA,removed,if wonderboy wins get ready to pick some cotton
MMA,removed,black people get caged for weed use more than whites but actually a redditor on an mma forum proves society actually needs to punish blacks more why is mma so full of right wing lunatics honestly so much political ignorance in this diverse community really odd
MMA,removed,you talk like a trump supporter
MMA,removed,andrade isnt ducking shes waiting for her next batches of dick pills to arrive from thailand i would say shes juiced to the tits but the test shes on made them disappear
MMA,removed,he actually called japanese wrestling with josh barnett they were a great team
MMA,removed,gangsta culture come on bud we all know what word you want to use youre not fooling anybody
MMA,removed,dude i see you in like every thread defending black fighters almost constantly any time somebody criticizes them ive memorized your damn username because youre always whiteknighting them literally im sure theyll be just fine without you rushing to their defense on reddit or maybe i like calling out bullshit when i see it i was just in another thread today shitting on mayweather because he actually deserves it and of course here it is hes just a race baiter its so fucking easy to talk about how people should just ignore this kind of shit when theyve never had to put up with it youre not in the spotlight youre not being inundated with this shit ive already said multiple times that hes off base on a lot of the things hes said but i can understand why hes ended up with that perspective and this cynical imposition that hes just exploiting it for personal gain is ridiculous
MMA,removed,mr mark hunt was held in contempt of court today after taking the stand and reportedly referring to the defendant as a shit eating white monkey fuck head needleinyourarse crook story coming
MMA,removed,are you
MMA,removed,the guy who wrote the rulebook and judging criteria saying exactly what i told you i have to explain this biweekly on this sub because no one wants to understand or apply the rules its a circlejerk of muhfavey httpwwwmmaweeklycomrefereejohnmccarthyexplainssignificantmmarulesandscoringcriteriachanges
MMA,removed,this makes you a race baiter apparently
MMA,removed,damn you just owned this guy hope he respond
MMA,removed,thats a if ive ever seen one
MMA,removed,you dipshit i just watched the video it mentions nothing about judges scoring based on volume rather than significant strikes do you understand what i am asking do i need hand puppets to help
MMA,removed,lets see who is silly when this gets thrown out reddit lawyers you guys are hilarious
MMA,removed,with this one we can see who performed better in each round propose a better one
MMA,removed,ive gotten into it with him before too whenever woodley is the headline then suddenly this whole sub is racist according to this jerkoff
MMA,removed,bah gawd thats thats indigotittys music oh no come on indigotitty that man has a family
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,pretty good fighter stfu dude
MMA,removed,well if there are multiple eggs commenting racist things on his twitter then they do exist right i mean im pretty sure athletes of other ethnicities than white get more racist comments than white people last question why isnt this guy allowed to defend black fighters
MMA,removed,the big kabosh
MMA,removed,hot
MMA,removed,lol shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,she looks just fine you would still hit it i would still hit it dont be a idiot and post tabloid headline shit
MMA,removed,wood berry my dick so far inside that ass whoever could pull it out would be crowned king arthur
MMA,removed,streams
MMA,removed,you and say whatever ever you want but our still a presumptuous twat
MMA,removed,you are deluded you started flinging the mud if you cant handle the heat
MMA,removed,and dont even try to talk shit about angela hill with op lol
MMA,removed,if youre referring to times where corners literally threw in the towel and not just ordinary corner stoppages some of the most famous would be thompson vs diaz and sylvia vs cabbage plus in pride there was liddell vs rampage and sakuraba vs royce throwing in the towel was much more common in the early days of the ufc too
MMA,removed,he gets to fight a rookie the opener of the worst card the ufc puts out every year enjoy
MMA,removed,thanks for downvoting my joke aspie
MMA,removed,to be honest he has promoted himself well in other areas like his web series or his podcast but calling your opponents fans kkk members is going pretty far when it comes to trash talk
MMA,removed,id love jones to fuck him uo i dont know where he got this idea from that hes a stud hes gary tonons bitch
MMA,removed,people arent counting him out vegas sets the lines dude they also had nunes at vs ronda its what vegas does theyre not stupid
MMA,removed,a fresh mendes wouldve finished it he mightve then if conor wasnt saved by an early stoppage
MMA,removed,austin meese the guy who knocked him down is interviewed about this here he mentions nothing about julians girlfriend getting beaten and doing this as revenge seems that reddit saw the video figured out it was julian wallace and made it all up after the fact well he beat his gf so thats probably why lol in the interview austin describes julian as a poser who was trying to fit in and if thats indeed the sole reason why he knocked him down hes as big a cunt as julian is
MMA,removed,and the team of jew lawyers for the ufc are laughing their asss off
MMA,removed,he thinks wonderboy fans are gonna take over and make everyone pick cotton if he wins the belt
MMA,removed,rmmastreams
MMA,removed,kavanagh best coach really must be all the casualsmcretards who dont even know who greg jackson is
MMA,removed,bisping fighter of the year fuck me this sub is retarded
MMA,removed,i completely agree with you also those jews should stop whining about that holocaust thing get over it it was over years ago
MMA,removed,yep i thought it was pretty clear i was joking but another rmma retard shows his insight you really showed me the true meaning of probability maybe i should put a s on my posts so idiots like you can contribute without embarrassing themselves
MMA,removed,if he suspects it but still accepts the fight he is also accepting an amount of responsibility i dont think that line of thinking will work in court thats like saying to the rape victim in theory he is a man and has a penis you knew there was a chance he could date rape you correct even if he loses he is doing the mma community a service by raking those fuckheads over the coals on his own dime and i respect the hell out of him for it i truly believe if you pop the opponent get the majority of the purse say athletics board gets the rest for operational costs
MMA,removed,lmao you fucking neckbeard
MMA,removed,nah she was personally insulting half the nation and just happen to put a little insult towards football and mma while she was at it no one gives a shit about these celebrities political opinions it didnt work during the election and people are fed up with these pretentious millionaires telling the ordinary people whats goodbad for them
MMA,removed,i havent watched pro wrestling since the early so you can shut your mouth you fuckin jabroni
MMA,removed,all hunt has to do is submit as exhibit a a youtube link of joey diazs brock hunt steroid rant hunt will win starts at but the whole piece is good
MMA,removed,it sounds like the worst selfhelp book youve ever read conceive achieve believe shut the fuck up buddeh
MMA,removed,ive been saying this for a while now masvidal is part of the elite of the sport it takes that one fight and right opponent for a fighter to transcend into stardom i believe this is the fight for masvidal come fight night i believe jorge will show fans what i already know masvidal is underated and extremely overlooked
MMA,removed,big clits in ya ass cocksucka
MMA,removed,this is mentioned page bullet point after vitors results were emailed out where dana addresses brock appearing on the website this is mentioned on page of the suit bullet point number admitting that negotiations began months prior mentioned on page the kicker at the end of the suit equity demands lesnar surrender his fight purse and all payperview proceeds to hunt and that the ufc surrender a proportionate share of its ufc profits in an amount to be proven at trial as justice requires pursuant to laws of equity i cant believe hehis attorney agreed for him to fight ubereem after complaining about all the juicing fighters he was forced to fight
MMA,removed,goat face puncher rapist domestic abuser cheater but fuck jone jones the morals of this sub are confusing
MMA,removed,lol fuck off
MMA,removed,christ dude i dont know what to tell you your comment was whiny and sounded like you were giving op shit for being sexist i dont particularly care about what you think what kind of person you are or how dense you like to be you got downvoted because the comment came off as shrill and preachy the end get a life and let it go
MMA,removed,heres the thing you said seals are special forces can they fall under the same command yes no ones arguing that you little bitch as someone who has over confirmed kills i am telling you specifically in the military no one calls seals sf if you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either theyre not the same thing if youre saying special operations youre referring to the united states special operations command which includes things from army rangers to my secret network of spies across the usa so your reasoning for calling a seal sf is because random people call the gorilla ones sf lets get sow and mrr in there then too also calling someone devgru or seal team six its not one or the other thats not how special operations command works theyre both a seal is a seal and a member of ussocom but thats not what you said you said a seal is sf which is not true unless youre okay with calling all operators of the ussocom family sf which means youd call rangers pararescuemen and other operators sf too which you said you dont its okay to just admit youre fucking dead kiddo
MMA,removed,stop lying wtfff
MMA,removed,how about a you spend way to much time on rmma dave get some fresh air you alcoholic
MMA,removed,yea because tyron is not a dickhead he is just black
MMA,removed,analytics last fight conor was moving forward aggressively of the fight nate was moving forward aggressively of the fight both at stand still trading shots or on the floor of the fight even if he was to be smarter and be a counter striker while being constantly on the move that isnt a bitch move then you must think low of ali who would use his movement or floyd mayweather jr who is always on the defense and shoots in at moments your comment shows lack of intelligence and screams out cheeto fingers internet warrior theyre both great fighters
MMA,removed,he got all rape of nanjing up in dat bitch
MMA,removed,its hip to like jon jones again these days hes just a misunderstood individual a victim of circumstances he did nothing wrong what rational person wouldnt run back for their stash of drugs after hitting a pregnant lady you cant really tell me that youd leave drugs in the vicinity of an unborn child what sort of sick twisted individual are you you fucking monster that woman cud take those drugs and damage her unborn child you irresponsible fuck jon jones is a fuking hero he protected that child from having a drug addled mother do u know what its lk have a drug addiction for a mother u fukin goof how cud she care for her child jon jones is a god amung men a tru inspiration and the greatest martial autist of all time

MMA,removed,true but he landed them on a diaz brother those dudes are practically immune to being knocked out
MMA,removed,doesnt all include nate and nick did we just get an admission the diazs are just like their boy gil filthy cheats
MMA,removed,because rgaypride is full of fine upstanding respectable individuals that suck and fuck each others cocks nothing wrong with it but people who whine about hendos shot clearly suck cocks they should go be with their kind

MMA,removed,using a whole bunch of different training partners is he also describes a bootcamp style regiment instead of a do whatever the fuck he wants style that he employed in the past thats revamping you uneducated fool
MMA,removed,ill add you to that list
MMA,removed,i hope cody knocks cruz out so hard he wakes up retarded cruz is a fucking asshole egotist

MMA,removed,my dream wmma fights would something like rough lesbian rape porn and the referee would most likely intervene
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,i hope holm gets that belt back tbh shes a great champion inside and outside the octagon
MMA,removed,that was a verbal rape dude
MMA,removed,oh gtfo
MMA,removed,welcome to rmma where people see what they want to see classics include silva kod bisbing completely it should have been stopped he was completely gone frankie dominated chad mendes swanson dominated siver rockhold completely outclassed weidman jj ruiend dc gus and osp people see what they want to see and usually only look at the result for evidence do you remember all the people on here saying that jose should do something at the weighins against mcgregor and jose had his team hassle mcgregor before going out pushed his face away during the weighin and had supports goad mcgregor on the way out and then they said that aldo was in conors head and conor was going to die via leg kicks and then the same retards that said all of that nonsense before started saying that aldo was too emotionally involved in the fight yeah this sub is full of drama seeking wannabe psycho analysts who know fuck all about sports let alone mma
MMA,removed,get ktfo then every gay dude in there gets their turn to nut inside you twice
MMA,removed,faggott
MMA,removed,the first two definitely werent aldo clearly lost the mental game and went fullretard okay you win that one kind of seriously though youre an irish ball sucking douchebag and borderline sociopath if you honestly are going to keep standing by your statement and cherrypicking supporting facts again im not sure why you deplore reality so much kiddo
MMA,removed,because at that height and weight you are roughly the width of the asshole you are eating right
MMA,removed,no dipshit i watched it about six hours ago
MMA,removed,i need to see my man guida fight again but i dont have where can i see this live
MMA,removed,plzfukoff
MMA,removed,no thats my entire point im glad you worked that out for yourself
MMA,removed,allahu akbar
MMA,removed,stream the payperview and bet sixty on conor then even if you lose its like you spent the money to watch the fight
MMA,removed,have you seen post ufc crocop fucking huge im not saying youre wrong but you very well could be
MMA,removed,sorry but this is hilarious this what happens when you act like a petty spoiled bitchand play up to the camera and mascarade as a fighter when really all you wanted was to be on the tv
MMA,removed,mma fan here i gave zero fucks about having the news spoiled if it was such a big deal this sub would put spoiler alerts around news like this but it doesnt because no one gives a shit about it as much as dana wants to pretend we do seriously like i cant get over the attitudes being expressed by some of the fans in here like you mother fuckers click on mma news links on here all the time without one fucking consideration of the source like they must be shills right there can not be that many petty fuckers in here
MMA,removed,listen dickhead many people expressed that they would of rather heard the news of brock returning through the ufcs official announcement during and if i have planned a surprise announcement and you fucking tell it to somebody before me guess what bitch you fucking spoiled it go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,you are the tool
MMA,removed,shaggin fuck off

MMA,removed,you fuck off goober
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,if you think a champion with or more title defenses should have to win or more fights before getting another title shot please delete your account defending or more times is a very rare occurrence in this sport and those that can pull it off should get a rematch whenever theyre ready to fight again ronda chris anderson etc did or should get instant rematches id be mad if they didnt
MMA,removed,tell everyone that looks at you that youre a big fucking douchebag at the top of your lungs it will have the same effect as wearing this shirt and save you some money
MMA,removed,i like cruzs asshole yeah uh me too
MMA,removed,chris brown simply couldnt put her away her chin must have been made out of mark hunt
MMA,removed,when hes right hes right eat shit haters

MMA,removed,we call for this mans blood
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,nothing the loser is probably eating a hotpocket right now
MMA,removed,hes berating him for throwing a pity party and crying for attention like a old girl would so emasculating him for a perfectly normal human response lol sexists like you amuse me so much if we had a conversation in real life youd leave crying just the same any person that emasculates someone in the way dana and yourself do is just advertising how pathetic they are
MMA,removed,admit you fucked up and apologise he didnt duck up he doesnt owe anyone an apology you are an idiot
MMA,removed,lol no it wasnt it had nothing to do with the sport and everything to do with one corrupted dickhead being a cunt should probably read on it before spewing nonsense
MMA,removed,omfg dude why dont you go fondle lombard and nurse him back to health yourself get over it lombard is a dangerous motherfucker so is dan you are a fan of a sport where these two dangerous fucking animals are beating on each other til one dropstil the ref stops it if you honestly expect them to be so tentative as to be ready to back off and stop fighting after each significant strike youre watching the wrong sport if you really believe that a fighter would risk letting a ref let his opponent continue by just backing off after they get dropped youre watching the wrong sport its not like everyones got mark hunt hands that can feel their opponents soul leave their body
MMA,removed,its the crackhead version of holly holm

MMA,removed,jun at utc httpiimgurcomgbjopdxjpg i want to clarify something my daughter told me what the commentators were saying during the fight and i felt insulted i have been practicing martial arts for years so i have no problem taking hits to the chest it is the rule and it isnt worse than a low kick my only problem during the fight is that my bra litterally slipped under my breasts this is why i stared embarrassed at the referee and i have no idea what jojo told me but i had to keep fighting it seems that i was being mocked because i seemed to be complaining of blows to the breast i think that i have nothing to prove regarding the numbers of hits i can take without complaining guys would you be able to keep fighting without being distracted if one of your nuts was slipping out of your shorts anyway it does not excuse my defeat but i wanted to clarify this part of the fight httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,removed,no offense but you sound like either an idiot or a kid the point was that they used her for advertising after she initially said no so she coulr focus on her fight then she did it since she does enjoy ninha warrior then she was asked to advertise which she did the ninja warrior didnt show her run how on earth is that her managers fault more so maybe someone being used like that doesnt sit right with her fans or people with common sense i know hurr durr white knight
MMA,removed,tate do you know what wrestling is cyborg i can rest my balls on your forehead tate i know
MMA,removed,you cant compare nuts and titties nobody wants to see some nuts but titties on the other hand
MMA,removed,im a fan of tonon and planet no you arent also its planet also tonon isnt from planet but fuck your arrogance and sweet justice usually prevails in the fighting community you obviously know about the history between these two and who is serving overdue sweet justice to who also who is gary fighting again do you even know the chances of him losing to this gracie are subatomic
MMA,removed,ju jitsu already is very homo erotic theres an underlying rule in ju jitsu that states when you lose in jujitsu the victor probably could of raped you if he wanted tonon is saying hed comendate the moment with a tattoo on his butt cheek i was just taking it a step forward i still expect you pc fucks to downvote me but thats just todays pc heav whats the real world internet
MMA,removed,probably best getting a stream to be honest very few pubs show ufc over here
MMA,removed,i guess if i got an asshole tattoo and wanted to rape my weaker grappling partners id be normal to you youre disgusting in your lack of self awareness
MMA,removed,lol motherfucker
MMA,removed,literally his asshole fell out
MMA,removed,came for the almost nip slip gif disappointed
MMA,removed,only wish i spoke french so i could hear her discuss her breasts in that beautiful language

MMA,removed,hes right
MMA,removed,no his brain works pretty normal very lonely attention seeking probably fat and thinks he knows how to fight by watching ufc
MMA,removed,calm down girls he was probably joking and referencing jon calling him a pussy

MMA,removed,im amazed you care enough to post the bjj stuff hits a nerve like no other
MMA,removed,just shows how stupid rmma is when they are so easily impressed with flashy shit
MMA,removed,stream
MMA,removed,id slap the brakes off cena too ye i hope you read that in conors voice lol
MMA,removed,op either just became a mma fan or is mentally retared i am thinking the latter
MMA,removed,it was in multiple embedded episodes and conors notorious tv series if you have watched almost every ufc event in the past decade you are a liar if you need to go online and lie to people means you are probably retarded or mentally unwell mental health is not a joke it should be taken seriously consult a professional
MMA,removed,tldr you are retarded
MMA,removed,gsp isis confirmed
MMA,removed,stfu
MMA,removed,yeah in a world where rodriquez vs cacares is a main event swanson vs dooho could easily be a good comain
MMA,removed,why are you downvoting me like a little bitch your chart is crappy because you used an average and made it seem like there were no defenses in abar graph that represents the number of actual fights doesnt suffer the same issue i know youre high off compliments from knucklehead rmma users but i gave you the better methodology downvotes to the left
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up plz
MMA,removed,oh youre one of those idiots
MMA,removed,its still the wild west when people start getting popped then everyone is on to the next method all of the alphabet soup laws that are being pushed will prevent that sort of thing though international data will be restricted and controlled even more tightly without need for reason or oversight to censor openly
MMA,removed,maybe go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,it is definitely offensive and the problem youre failing to put your finger on is that none of us give a fuck so go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,how the fuck are you this dumb
MMA,removed,they better get a new fucking staff if ronda has been at this boxing gym for so long and minimal improvements edmond you fucking cuck
MMA,removed,httpwwwufccomrankings the fuck is the matter with you people i agree wonderboy should get the shot but robbie getting a shot wouldnt be a tragedy
MMA,removed,is this dude retarded
MMA,removed,you sound like a huge douchebag
MMA,removed,youre a tool an ignorant tool at that
MMA,removed,no that was the first and only insult i was expressing a different opinion about danahers post and all you could do is act like anything opposing your view is wrong weird and sad is the guy who has to insult someones writing because its not precisely how you think it should be
MMA,removed,youre such an idiot and dont deserve to watch ufc it was supposed to be a wrestling match not an mma match and puder broke kayfabe
MMA,removed,yeah but your brazilian brbrbrbrbr you probably also think shooting a robber is the perfect stoppage
MMA,removed,i mean i get that this is in direct response to someone nuthugging conor mcgregor so this wont be received well but how could we pretend that mcgregor isnt the least likeable champion in recent history literally everything he says makes him look like a giant douchebag you guys just like it for some reason
MMA,removed,bisping doesnt autocorrect to bitchpig you fucking goofball i kill ya
MMA,removed,flair up your bud its obvious
MMA,removed,how often do you masturbate a week

MMA,removed,oh fuck off you liberal cunt
MMA,removed,lol youre so certain of your opinions its laughable id love to see your thoughts on other fights before they happened i bet you thought lots of things were obviouscertain or thought theyd play out a certain way and were wrong its frankly laughable for you to tell me with absolute clarity that lawler is not a good style match up for conor its delusional to be certain you know that right
MMA,removed,kav made a small religious joke on twitter and khabib got upset in the way only muslims seem to
MMA,removed,youre also white as snow i love when white people pretend to be a poc on reddit make up a story about the terrible amount of racism theyve endured then try to say racism doesnt really exist whats so wrong in your life you have to pretend to be someone else whenever we do anything in this world we are fulfilling needs you have a need to downplay the amount of racism in this country and you need to lie to do it those are odd needs to fill there i find you hilariously pathetic friend
MMA,removed,the show persona has matured he seems like a very descent guy away from mma he is taking she sow to another level and thats a good thing for all involved but being the first out the door is always hardest
MMA,removed,oh fuck off you whiney cunt
MMA,removed,i dont think conors dick is deep enough in your mouth

MMA,removed,did you read my post if you refute me do it with facts who were the viable contenders and their winstreaks
MMA,removed,lol that hesitation the dude is such a bad liar everybody knows college drug testing is a joke
MMA,removed,jon pretty much saved his arm mj wouldnt have been able to tap because his right arm was trapped underneath khabib
MMA,removed,your a dipshit it wasnt a close fight it was a fucking draw that means no one won which means rematch get the fuck outta here with your bs

MMA,removed,shut your filthy whore mouth
MMA,removed,chris seems like a cool dude the guy interviewing him seems like a chode
MMA,removed,zhifpost
MMA,removed,mcgregor fans are so used to being dickheads to conors opponents but since nate whooped him theyve had to go back to formerpotential opponents
MMA,removed,why would henderson want a rematch if its not for the title he already beat him nothing to gain
MMA,removed,i only brought it up in response to the guy telling me i dont and i said fuck you to his dismissive tone but yeah obviously if i cursed on the internet theres no way i would be allowed in a gym grow up

MMA,removed,lol shut the fuck up you dont know him stop acting like you do
MMA,removed,i just think pointing to those two fighters is a bit of a misnomer because they have gifted arm lengths i do agree though especially about the need for a good jab people had their masturbation sessions after gsp came from roach with a much much improved jab

MMA,removed,so much mma is built around insecure men they were turned into fighters when some girl broke their fragile heart real men would not punch each other in the head to prove how real or true their toughness is it takes more courage to do something creative that ads value to the world
MMA,removed,really dude dont you think what youre doing is a bit pathetic youre the one who tried to cut and run from this very same argument when i called you out on your bullshit you have yet to offer anything substantive in this thread
MMA,removed,why does he need a reason it seems like you can root against anyone in the ufc but if you go against punk his retard wrestling fans think its not acceptable fuck cm punk he doesnt deserve to be there hes going to get beat bad just watch dont type back just watch
MMA,removed,nobody should have to ask only a retard doesnt understand that
MMA,removed,when you have one fighter who has an advantage in significant strikes that isnt that large and the other was controlling him a lot of the round along with aggression as the other fighter ran and octagon control significant strike difference is not small that doesnt include the overall striking difference conor has accuracy while diaz had again you are putting octagon control and aggression over getting punched in the face more someone skipped the reading comprehension course
MMA,removed,fuck off

MMA,removed,sorry i meant the main card im stupid and didnt read this was only the weigh in
MMA,removed,hey buddy i was trying to walk away because you clearly are suffering from some kind of asd firstly you start out trying to be some kind of white knight to a fucking joke about conor being a girl so aside from that total fucking non sequitur you then go on to talk about social dynamics of girls while coming off as super condescending and patronising about how females interact like you cant be pretty and be around other pretty girls i mean wtf then you try and ratify this expert social critique by using a story aimed to boost the egos of social outcasts as a reference to your statement and expect to still be taken seriously so dont go tagging me in snarky responses because i did your autistic self a favour by not piling onto the hate
MMA,removed,aldo is a pussy ass bitch
MMA,removed,i did explain what he potential was based on all you responded with was see hurr called it toldya only likes him which doesnt prove your argument at all he isnt very good because hes probably almost of your sorry lifetime of unachievement nice pulling more straws out of your sexually confused anus tell me where i ever said sages potential was purely due to looks skill plays a massive part but to act like looks dont help elevate popularity at all is like saying charisma or gift of gab doesnt help elevate popularity at all gsp isnt considered ugly in fact his name is brought up relatively frequent whenever the sub takes their usual homoerotic turn from time to time hes also uniquely charismatic and very skilled these are qualities that make a superstar mcgregor sound familiarly similar sage is he is green because he is young and has a shit camp he has over a decade of improvement left tell me where the rationale that sage has potential to be popular is unrealistic
MMA,removed,if you lost in your debut to some clown that low on the spectrum you think you will have success against the monsters down the line just accept that mma isnt for you and get yourself a retail job bro

MMA,removed,pretty sad they give him such a tough fight after such a long break kind of expected tho since ufc doesnt really like building up asian fighters

MMA,removed,well i mean you saw the video of him folding a frying pan into a tortilla

MMA,removed,it takes balls to say someone whos cut weight more times than youve beat off cant mentally handle it
MMA,removed,just masturbate through the pain son you can do it
MMA,removed,wwe fans comments on cm punks performance have been some of the most mind boggling things i have ever read i think i seriously got cancer here are a few examples proceed with caution mickey gall is an asshole for going in that hard i have been watching ufc for a long time and even the most aggressive fighters do not go in that hard comier not even roy neslon goes in that hard he had zero respect for punk you dont go straight for the submission the audience craves punches and kicks its as if gall just purposely wanted to ruin punks image all for the sake of his own ego i understand but i have never seen a fighter go in like that brock lost his first ufc fight to mir but even mir had respect in the ring this guy was just disrespectfulrefering to gall punk will be champion you haters mark my words facepalm punk a heavyweight title shot right now he deserves it because he proved himself as a wwe entertainer facepalm
MMA,removed,wwe isnt a fucking sport though its a soap opera for retarded mouthbreathers

MMA,removed,nobody wants to watch midgets fight tho
MMA,removed,omg buzz youre so cute in that one
MMA,removed,ariel the cuck in full force on this clip
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,ariel helwanni is a cm punk fan or just about anything jewish fanboy as a broadcaster and journalists you have to sacrifice fanaticism for the overall greater good of the sport too bad his fanaticism is not improving the outlook for the careers of those who talks up cm punk noad lahat and not getting the spotlight on fighters like chris gallinsky either way he still does an adequate job
MMA,removed,you know what your opinion means nothing to me
MMA,removed,like how pride died because of its constant freakshow fights or am i thinking of another pride org that everybody still argues was the best and will never be beat
MMA,removed,oh fuck off
MMA,removed,then maybe you should be on a fucking money making subreddit if you feel that way this one is for mma fans mighty mouse is one of the best mma fighters in the world even more than that hes the best of the best this modern nihilistic notion that it is completely acceptable and should even be encouraged for them to intentionally sabotage the quality of their product for the sake of profit just because theyre a private business is unbelievably childish and naive the ends do not automatically justify the means and while its understandable that a company might think that way the fact that any intelligent fan of the sport would ever actually condone such a thing is absolutely mindboggling youre like a slave praising your master for their efficient use of labor people like you disgust me
MMA,removed,good for stipe and reem real fighters getting paid is nice
MMA,removed,riiiight because cm punk himself can shit on the sanctity of the sport by implying he belongs in the most elite fighting organization on the planet with virtually no experience among people whom have dedicated their entire lives to get to that spot but ariel has his panties in a knot because joe an experienced mma analyst simply vocalized the inevitable outcome the whole build up for this useless match up was just very tiresome for a fan like me who actually wants to watch legitimate matchups forget how any experienced martial artist would feel about this bullshit fight how the fuck did you even expect him to call the fight yep its exactly what it looks like heres a delusional dude getting mauled by a martial artist give me a break in the postfight conference cm punk said there was an alternate reality where he won the delusion extends beyond infinity he doesnt need your respect ariel he needs somebody to protect him from the yes man retards like you who will throw money at a cheap spectacle absent concern for his wellbeing go fuck yourself i mean come on
MMA,removed,i think we need mm in heavyweight division let him bulk up or run in circles

MMA,removed,yeah manyou shouldve seen it dana opened the meeting at the table by saying that he thought wrestling was boring unless you were cm punk or brock then things got weird youre clearly just being a wise ass so go fuck yourself i was mistaken and did not have my facts straight speaking of factswhere is your proof that sakuraba used peds you clearly implied that in another thread thats slander dummy

MMA,removed,rmmastreams do your work
MMA,removed,i get paid per upvote
MMA,removed,first of all im not defending any one specific fighter but the concept of using trt for tbi patients including mma fighters in which its indicated apparently youre the one with difficulty grasping that concept secondly patients are not necessarily left on trt for life some are some arent some respond to the treatment or the initial causative factor is treatedremoved tldr ive spoken based on my own experience working with patients as well as providing sources youve provided a purely emotional argument with no facts assuming that i care about or am defending any one fighter rather than a concept backed by medical research go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,prepare to get downvoted fella this entire sub would happily get on their knees if conor asked them to
MMA,removed,she objectively lost points when she decided to buzz it all off but ok

MMA,removed,fuck off lahey
MMA,removed,christ you are woefully dense he has to start somewhere this is making people care about him even if its only a few at first youre making it sound as if hes screwing up because he isnt already dominating the headlines if he keeps winning this shit is going to snowball go ahead and keep whining about how hes not being a good heel it wont make a damn bit of difference
MMA,removed,what the fuck does that have to do with anything in this thread another useless conor post gtfo
MMA,removed,have none of you assholes watched ufc

MMA,removed,i had a really stupid discussion with someone the other day we were talking about bjj for self defense for women and we sorta reversed the scenario like an attacker with demian mai level jits would be a nightmare he would be the unstoppable rapist the goat rapist
MMA,removed,thats a wonderful theory except he even admits he didnt know what month his kid was due in this interview you see conor cant be bothered with these types of details he has to spend his time telling the media that he still holds both belts and figuring out which car to lease next
MMA,removed,if that were true you wouldnt even watch the sport gtfo lol

MMA,removed,not yet
MMA,removed,i believe he has a much stronger gas tank than people think last fight he was swinging for the fences but people ignore he got absolutely rocked which can drain your gas tank he was fine up until he got clocked then he slowed way down i dont think thats a coincidence the guy went rounds and looks incredible against max he has a good gas tank but a mixture of gaining a bunch of weight slacking on cardio training throwing everything he had into punches and getting rocked all played a part
MMA,removed,kind of sad how many people think gsp didnt roid if you think gsp was natty youre really naive and stupid
MMA,removed,could lead to more draws which frankly i think would be a good thing overall
MMA,removed,heres another true story with samantha the girl in this video i dated her in high school and college we would frequently make love after class in my dorm room right under the albert einstein poster one day i was about to enter her from behind and she launched this energy wave from her asshole it felt like a degree puff of air it enveloped my penis and instantly and legitimately knocked out my erection
MMA,removed,i dont think so close fight its going to be closer than aldoedgar
MMA,removed,just lol at nyc freezing for half year blazing hot and humid for the other half garbage everywhere expensive no car head thrust into jamal or tyrones armpit on the subway everyday in la you have goat weather spacious houses and apartments surfing snowboarding hunting car culture people out on the beach enjoying the sun with dem doges goat mexican food goat women bjj and mma mecca partying with celebrities and so much more live in london right now which is better than nyc but still subpar compared to cali

MMA,removed,yeah this is what they do they fuck up their health at the cost of your entertainment and everyone is tuning in paying money to see them so yeah it is millions disappearing you dont have that kind of money so you dont understand that having millions doesnt mean you can afford to spend that much money especially if youre investing that few million could get you big propertys and other things thatll make you more and more money you dont get rich or stay rich by blowing all your money on dumb shit i know people worth over million that wont pay more than a dollar for a can of coke theyre not even jewish or brown if you ever make that much money you will feel a lot differently

MMA,removed,your dads retarded
MMA,removed,how about you realize that when a foty candidate like that one happens the sub is going to talk about it for a while your post is pretty fucking stupid and indicative of you being the worst kind of cunt it was most likely the highest selling ppv in ufc history the fights were fucking excellent and people are going to talk about it it was what could have been you are either trolling or just a stupid asshole i hope for your sake it is the former

MMA,removed,man theres no arguing with you because youre not willing to listen first of all i just pointed out one instance of a fighter specifically using the big screen tactically and you ignore it you can be sure he checked the clock and sure he was resetting and trying to recover but it doesnt mean he didnt use the screen to gauge his distance from diaz second all check my flair i supported diaz in this fight so you say what you want about mcg fans lastly go fuck yourself

MMA,removed,well thats just trumps racism showing though

MMA,removed,she just wouldnt stop opening her mouth i mean who is this fat bitch does she fight does she wanna fight because if youre talking like that you better be ready to fight
MMA,removed,first mma is still far from a mainstream sport you guys shouldnt take it too personally that an upper class old white woman has misconceptions about a sport that is only a little bit over years old she probably has misconceptions about video games and social media as well second i thought the speech was fine obviously not a trump supporter here and the two jabs at football and mma were just throwaway attempts at adding levity to an obviously emotional situation for her its not like she mocked a disabled reporter she just made an uninformed joke about two sports how many times have you guys made excuses for comedians like bill burr saying dumb things using the well hes a comedian excuse well shes an old actress did you really expect her to know about mmas demographics mma right now is probably just a bit below the level of popularity as hockey nascar and roughly equal to mls soccer in the us everyone knows it exists a good chunk of the population might even know some of the bigger names but beyond that the vast majority of the population is in the dark about it think about hockey probably every american in this sub knows of the nhl and ice hockey how many of you can name active players third and i can say this pretty confidently as a guy whos been following the sport since the mid mmas fandom has largely been dominated by white men during the dark ages it mostly survived on forums like sherdog and theunderground this isnt a bad thing in isolation but it does contribute to the stereotype that its a white sport even if the athletes themselves come from all over lastly if you guys listen to the actual substance of what she said shes saying something pretty relevant that in the wake of trump we need to be watchful for foreigners and journalists both groups have had big targets on their backs since before the election from trump
MMA,removed,who cares what some hollywood leftist says
MMA,removed,even worse the liberal hollywood promotes negative stereotypes for all minorities out there particularly the black community
MMA,removed,stuff like this is really why trump won out of touch elites talking down to working people and exposing their ignorance trumps gonna win a second term pretty easily at this rate
MMA,removed,skip to minute second mark if youre on mobile
MMA,removed,they are doing the damndest to indoctrinate the snowflake generation though
MMA,removed,she a high falutin pleb yo just cause shes good at make believe dont mean shes qualified to make a sound opinion on anything
MMA,removed,social justice warriors dont count french and russian as diversity because their white
MMA,removed,the fact that theyre ok with that headlining a major ppv is a slap in the face to fans i will be pirating that one
MMA,removed,you understand were not talking about total warfare between nations right i shouldnt be arguing with someone like you i apologize have a good one

MMA,removed,it looks nothing like you asshole
MMA,removed,youre being downvoted because you are in every thread spouting some crazy nonsense edgy brah style that has nothing to do with what we are talking about you should go read comment history and try be a little more self aware youre an embarrassment to this sub
MMA,removed,keep going hollywood in more years trump will win by an even yuger margin
MMA,removed,again youre projecting the rational answer to lies andor insults is to fight back triggering as defined by the hillary fringe is a weird unhinged overreaction much like a lot of meryl acting ironically the fact that she doesnt know what the fuck shes talking about doesnt give her a pass you cant expect to say stupid shit and not be duly criticized and ridiculed its simple really and no more casual than swatting a fly
MMA,removed,from fake news and liberal propaganda disguised as entertainment
MMA,removed,fuck meryl streep shes a cunt
MMA,removed,and your comment if just a vast wealth or knowledge and intelligence lmao gtfo
MMA,removed,lol youre trying to teach mma fans that a word like retarded us offensive good luck of the people here are either a trailer trash b fratstars c conservative as hell d dumb as rocks although im sure all the aforementioned groups all form a concentric circle in a venn diagram

MMA,removed,fuck meryl streep
MMA,removed,yeah ive always been especially annoyed at feminists trying to meddle in sports but even i agree with them on that front uswnt absolutely deserve fatter checks
MMA,removed,shes not talking about the diversity she should have said wwe she meant retarded trump voting fans
MMA,removed,as compared to those gracious republicans that handled both of obamas wins with such grace and dignity
MMA,removed,ubereem was horsed to the nips
MMA,removed,the main point of the speech was that trump making fun of the reporter with a disability was wrong and that trump is against hollywood foreigners and the press i believe mixed martial arts is a sport and that the martial arts contained therein are art forms mma is the most pure sport out there the criticism of trump is valid
MMA,removed,definitely no blowjobs after the holms fight hes probably on handjobs now after the nunes fight

MMA,removed,i didnt think that much ignorance could be rolled into one person but youve proven me wrong uviolentrites
MMA,removed,great argument so if someone behaves in a way that fits a negative stereotype then bigotry becomes magically acceptable interesting lets apply this exact logic and scenario to black people calling kimbo slice a ner isnt racist by any stretch of the term he calls him that because of how he talks and acts if he spoke with normal vernacular and didnt say things like know what im sayin i dont know nothing about that these is some tough guys he wouldnt go with that angle if you didnt know the diaz brothers did grow up in a bad area with a lot of gangs and that culture rubbed off on them which is obvious to anyone who isnt deaf
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,fuck off that right hand from woodley wouldve dropped a middleweight woodley just has that kind of power despite how many lawler fanboys try to downplay it
MMA,removed,alright ill bite go fuck yourself you nobody
MMA,removed,lol stfu
MMA,removed,and youre an idiot
MMA,removed,let me guess you didnt start watching mma until about like majority of people on here
MMA,removed,id fuck the shit out this chick
MMA,removed,for god sake condit only made last night how are people literally this stupid ffs
MMA,removed,theyre not doing it now and all he did was hurt some feelings by referencing it fuck off
MMA,removed,like i said you just need to actually watch the fight instead of watching highlights in between jerking off to the nate diaz poster on your wall im not saying he wanted to take shots but he was willing to eat a shot to give a shot while he was against the fence because he knew he needed to retaliate to get off the fence otherwise hes just covering up and the fight could be stopped
MMA,removed,tell that to nate or floydconors an agressive counter puncher tooand no i dont understand thatbecause its bullshit you dont understand it because youre stupid the whole point of counterpunching is to counter your opponents strikes meaning they have to throw a strike im not going to ask floyd because were not talking about boxing and im not going to ask nate because hes not a counterpuncher or maybe stop sucking up to conor and pretending he obviously won the fightbecause he didntat all this simply confirms my suspicions that youre on the spectrum and not worthy of all the attention ive given you peace
MMA,removed,showerthought id rather have sex with pvz than fucking my fleshlight
MMA,removed,physiologically speaking you cant and dont recover from damage in a span of minutes you recover cardio just out of curiousity have you ever actually fought before have you ever been punched have you ever sparred at least or even trained im not saying the actual tissues repair during recovery thats just you desperately grasping at straws because youve backed yourself into a corner taking damage makes you tired yes but thats also damage you recover from in the fight its called active recovery its impossible to explain to someone whose never fought before what that even means its different than being just tired or drained cardio wise your simplistic view of how damage effects a fight is very telling of your level of comprehension of the fight game in general walk into a gym and train before you get into these conversations youll save yourself a lot of embarrassment
MMA,removed,no youre speaking outside of your area of expertise is what youre doing you have zero idea of what its like to take a punch or be in a fight how the body feels when being hit how it feels to recover during a fight how your cardio is affected i get it tissue recovery is going to take a long time to say oh well if theyre still alive at the end of the fight must means they win because they obviously didnt get hurt is pure stupidity and naivety not uncommon amongst doctors who are typically shut ins
MMA,removed,the worst sentence ive read today so youre a douche with bad grammar who cant read youre the gift that keeps on giving
MMA,removed,dude shut up ur gay
MMA,removed,keep it secret keep it safe been doing this for years plz dont patch it

MMA,removed,doesnt the vpn slow down the stream i think my country portugal is one of those blocked so i cant even watch it legally in fight pass and im looking for a solution
MMA,removed,you clearly have no idea what sparring is theres zero brain damage unless you go hard most sparring is not hard only professional fighters should ever go hard since there is a risk of brain damage there maybe you should shut the fuck up about things you dont know anything about
MMA,removed,elloworld already mentioned how it works once youre signed up but in terms of a good vpn service i use httpreviewmyvpncomnordvpnreview i stream hd video through it all the time with no issue the only other thing that can someones be an issue is payment if they restrict by billing address but i just use paypal
MMA,removed,claire from daredevil you mean rosario dawson how do you not know who that is httpsfatgfycatcomnauticalseriousgavialwebm
MMA,removed,how am i an idiot for pointing out facts also its kinda funny how you keep downvoting me proves how immaturepetty you are

MMA,removed,yeah im getting sick of this shit but we only have to deal with it until august and when conor loses again all these fair weather fans with fuck off until rondas return then theyll come back screaming shes the greatest fighter of all the lifetimes
MMA,removed,for the longest time i thought they were called uppercunts because youd bend down and blast a shot right up somebodys cunt i thought it just had a nasty name like rapechoke or something just kidding i never thought that

MMA,removed,some asshole what are you gonna say to jon dw well depends what hes gonna say to me
MMA,removed,my thoughts too he could have said oh mousasi threw his name in there since its all over twitterr instead he acted like mousasi was a random name that popped up in his head obviously mousasi was on that text he was reading
MMA,removed,june fuck the fuck off the ufc didnt know about this
MMA,removed,youre crazy if you think bisping isnt being serious hed take that fight in a heartbeat
MMA,removed,should have flagged lesnar fuck him and his roid taking ass i dont care if hes not doing it now hes done it for his career so fuck him even if they dont catch him i soooo hope hunt knocks his head in it will be awesome
MMA,removed,jon sounded sincere the fakest motherfucker in mma sounded sincere are you high
MMA,removed,so youre prefer for no fight at all these are special circumstances i prefer a fight over nothing
MMA,removed,a year old with a history of athletics including boxing that probably has opted to take legal trt injectables not orals or creams would look like that considering he has the money for the best trainers and foods around
MMA,removed,do you know if streams will be available from the mma stream sub
MMA,removed,cut that piece of shit he has had every chance and advantage fuck him
MMA,removed,you told her its cuz your gay right
MMA,removed,that looks like some sort of masturbation feature
MMA,removed,jon jones should be banned from the ufc for life he should be made an example of that no matter how talented or great you are you should only be given limited chances in life he has been giving so many second chances if any other person had did the same things he did with less talent they would be banned or in jail by now
MMA,removed,blah blah tainted supplement blah blah i plan on appealing blah blah
MMA,removed,jon jones should be banned from the ufc for life he should be made an example of that no matter how talented or great you are you should only be given limited chances in life he has been giving so many second chances if any other person had did the same things he did with less talent they would be banned or in jail by now

MMA,removed,jones is a fucking thug with freakishly long reach like the stretch guy toywas hoping to watch dc slam him unconscious
MMA,removed,looks like you used gut instead
MMA,removed,my question for the ufc is as follows why in the uk do they feel it necessary monopolise the best payperview fights with bt sport i would gladly purchase fight pass if it were even available in glasgow scotland i will be heading over to rmmastreams to watch the fight for nothing since i do not nor will i ever use bt
MMA,removed,crossinf my fingers that no weight cut bisping is taking this fight
MMA,removed,jones is taken of the goat list in my book much like anderson was sorry peds is cheating and his career is tainted mm or gsp for
MMA,removed,i could give two shits what this cunt says
MMA,removed,just because its have hw doesnt mean its a hw fighter anything over is hw so this could be an out of camp mwlhw that said hed fight if he doesnt have to cut weight
MMA,removed,even better
MMA,removed,right because rooting for a fighter in a sport shows you have messed up priorities for some a couple of things is enough and for others it needs to pile up in order to quit rooting for someone who the fuck are you to question his priorities over who he rooted for and why that might be the dumbest shit said in the whole thread
MMA,removed,jesus enough with the paid shill nonsense she works for the fucking ufc no shit you make it sound like shes a weasel amongst journalists
MMA,removed,i would pass out from all my blood rushing to my massive boner

MMA,removed,viagra
MMA,removed,as much as id love to see it this fight just cant happen right now mousasi or bisping
MMA,removed,ufc fights started falling apart once the ufc introduced free healthcare coverage for their fighters
MMA,removed,yeah i dont know what this person is bitching about has been the greatest stretch of mma in history this person clearly wasnt around in when pretty much of every fight fell through because of injuries
MMA,removed,weed is only tested for in competition
MMA,removed,because hes the same color as poops

MMA,removed,and puffy nips
MMA,removed,as a long time jones supporter i would just like to say that jones can fuck off and die dc is still a dork though
MMA,removed,i was thinking this but too pussy to write it anywhere it was so eerie how he looked at jones when he was hyping people up for ariel
MMA,removed,what about the timing though for some fighters they have waited till after the fight if they were big draws
MMA,removed,lol i meant to put weight fixed

MMA,removed,turn your white racist ears up then
MMA,removed,discount fight pass ppvs instead of stream all events on fight pass for people that dont have or cable in general and then put on fp exclusive cards that are worth watching
MMA,removed,this sounds most likely its rare where ill just give up if i cant find a stream of something because they have dope antipiracy shit if anything it makes me want to search harder you feel like the internet indiana jones archeologizing the web to find this forbidden moment of entertainment then you find it you dodge a half dozen adds listen to one clip of a guy in his garage with a lamborghini and there it is the super blurry russian dubbed i dont know where im going with this but antipiracy sucks
MMA,removed,in my opinion yes gsp is a money fight but he is certainly worthy of a title fight even in a division above him i think gsp is as worthy as the rockholdweidmansuzaromero
MMA,removed,angela magana thats all you need to know source

MMA,removed,it was his fault to put the fight there and stay there can you fucking read
MMA,removed,do you have down syndrome if he started his ufc career in light weight instead of feather he wouldve fought guys like khabib eddie alvarez rda diaz cerrone years before not just recently
MMA,removed,look at all the reddit feelings children voting this down they dont want any gay people to possibly feel upset because civilized society has told them that they are beautiful and wonderful and delicate
MMA,removed,what a homo
MMA,removed,just stfu already the fight its on
MMA,removed,so many cucks in here
MMA,removed,no it does not logically follow that i support infringing peoples freedom because i think someone should apologize for an assholish comment indeed you didnt invoke the first amendment it is however a convenient way to cover freedom of expression i dont need to denigrate you your shitty logic showed you to be a dipshit
MMA,removed,he could beat rothwell arlovski barnett and nelson not sure about browne but i dont think brock has ever beaten anyone bigger than him he would get wrecked by miocic werdum cain overeem and jds any of these guys could fuck the shit out of his wife and there would be nothing brock could do about it

MMA,removed,you reeeeeaaaaally need to look into how elaborate the ped schemers are i wouldnt put anything past people willing to cheat
MMA,removed,jacare fucked himself before the yoel fight back at ufc yoel and jacare were meant to fight unfortunetely weeks from the fight jacare gets sick and pulls out no biggie a week or so later weidman gets hurt and is pulled from the event dana suggests an interim title then loandbehold jacare miraculously gets better and offers to fight belfort for the interim title on the same card he was too sick to fight on
MMA,removed,yeah no one ever wants to talk about josh thompsons massive bellator contract per fight and hes one of their top stars b b b b but reebok
MMA,removed,weidman was already booked for the title shot when jacare beat okami so he wasnt going to get the next one following that weidman and silva had a rematch so jacare wasnt going to get one then following that machida was scene as the next obvious contender and a future killer so he took precedent over jacare again following that weidman ran into a bunch of injuries while vitor was waiting for his deserved title shot finally it happened following that rockhold and jacare were the next to fight weidman rockhold got the nod because he had more impressive wins including one over jacare theeeeeeen jacare lost he does deserve it now but whatever
MMA,removed,get fucked in the butt
MMA,removed,yeah but at least were not brazil

MMA,removed,agree with the fightpass idea i hate how you need to switch between different things to watch the whole event why the fuck cant i just watch the whole thing on fightpass i dont even own cable tv so i need to illegally stream prelims if i want them but if the ufc let me buy the ppv inc early prelims and prelims id just do that whether you bought the event through fightpass youtube or whatever you should be able to watch every fight your idea just makes it easier for the fans

MMA,removed,the only reason he is considered a great fighter is the hipster movement no asshole the reason he is considered a great fighter is because he was the champ in the then best org in the world in a weight class where any moment any punch can end the fight regardless of whether his opponents are not legit competition in terms of name recognition which imo is not the best yardstick or simply just mismatches on paper he beat all of them for as long as he did add to that the fact that juicing was legal in japan thats a hell of an accomplishment beating up roided competition compare that to the ufc hw belt which changed hands every so often we checked the record we know the facts below is a list of articles and interviewsquotes with fighters who all say he is the goat i guess they are all hipsters too

MMA,removed,i dont like when people act like their own personal shit is worse or larger than what other people go through its my opinion i feel like when people say that they are being uppity assholes so i state my opinion on an opinion website you didnt like what i said so you responded thats how this works if you only want your own opinion go to church
MMA,removed,i cant believe youre getting downvoted for this goddammit people the diaz brothers have already started a brawl in the octagon and the announcer literally said
MMA,removed,sucks conon is allowed his girlfriend in the audience they could at least nates boyfriend in to sweet talk him during rounds and revive him when he gets sparked with a jab nates autism handler should speak to the commission and explain he needs his best fwend foweva in there with him or his autism will spike
MMA,removed,yeah nate outright saying hes a punk bitch and that his team staged the entire thing youll never get me to believe anything but

MMA,removed,too much blacked out content in canada tsn bought up the rights to most of the live stuff and sticks it on tsn which you generally need a special sports package to receive im not paying for a couple events and the ufc cant show it on fightpass so i wont pay for the handful of fightpass exclusive fights i acknowledge that its shitty to take it without paying but they just arent offering it at a price that is reasonable for me so ill watch the high quality free online streams until they change something

MMA,removed,worth opponent bisping is a chode
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,coner macgreger is my favorite fighter reported for fan bashing
MMA,removed,anthony johnson cyborg
MMA,removed,if you thought hendo won you might be are definitely retarded
MMA,removed,ive got hendo with as well this guy needs to get bispings nuts off his forehead theyre covering his eyes
MMA,removed,dude got hit so hard he did the heil hitler
MMA,removed,wasnt his fight vs silvia on fight pass you illegally stream fightpass
MMA,removed,would let her triangle me
MMA,removed,not naked enough
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up thats such a fallacy i can show you fighters pulling punches within inches of their opponents unconscious face mark hunt is a retard and he can feel it easily
MMA,removed,title is misleading she is not naked
MMA,removed,to everyone who is downvotinginsulting people who think hendo won the fight may i remind you of the recent lawler vs condit fight condit outstruck lawler winning every single round except the final round in terms of volume but lawler got the decision because judges weighed his damage output as being more significant just sayingit isnt so clear cut that this fight definitely shouldve gone one way or the other so please fuck off with the insultsdownvotes both sides of this discussion are valid

MMA,removed,stfu john
MMA,removed,did hendo beat that ass so raggedy bisping couldnt even show up to the presser
MMA,removed,she still has clothes on
MMA,removed,youre on strmbwls stream right
MMA,removed,i honestly dont even know i have over different streams depending on how laggy some are
MMA,removed,hahaha what are you serious so youre saying rockhold gave less than effort on a title defense you might literally be retarded
MMA,removed,i would like to see you there in the cage being sent in a coma and possibly dying for a superlate stoppage because it happens
MMA,removed,it just happened that most brazilians fighters had the same decline since usada or trt bans must be another coincidence
MMA,removed,and fuck those that support the cheaters that condone peds and steroids they are part of the problem
MMA,removed,fuck you
MMA,removed,lol conor is one of the best mma artists to grace this sport and you say sum cum chump like ball guzzler can stomprucker him
MMA,removed,ur just some dudetrans on wow on cod on the gameplay shits calmd own
MMA,removed,and hes clean which for me its the most important thing
MMA,removed,it reveals it if you read it if you see the words spoiler times before the actual title why would you read it if you havent watched the event
MMA,removed,usada is the best thing that has even happened to mmaufc actually the best thing
MMA,removed,ulolareyouforreal the guy isnt too bright from the little i watched giving yourself a superhuman level of hormones is cheating guy is a bodybuilder later in the video he also says roidrage isnt a thing aka doesnt exist but admits roids make u crazy and that rapist serial killers have times higher steroids really didnt understand that part well
MMA,removed,god what the hell is this nonsense if this was under olympic boxing rules bisping would have won every round but round you potato in amateur olympic boxing rules a knockdown doesnt mean anything its counted the same as any other clean shot to the head you get points for clean shots to your opponents head body and gloves considering bisping played a great volume punching game throughout and outlanded hendo by over strikes he would have won with even more skewed scores in an olympic boxing ring youre a jackass hendo landed literally solid shots on the feet over the entire minutes stick to ufc rules because that helps your case more at least judges gave it to hendo
MMA,removed,youre right even though both use gym and weights adn even same lift but use a different rep range both use the bench press and squat and even deadlift differences bodybuilders train for pure size where as powerlifters train for brute strength training for the powerlifter implies training in a very low rep range reps and many singles is the crux of the powerlifters routine these reps are completed with maximal poundage and extremely long rest periods bodybuilders are more concerned with diet and concerned with appearance than powerlifters a powerlifter clearly doesnt care about appearance as the main goal in the sport of powerlifting is to move as much weight as possible proper diet either makes or breaks a bodybuilders appearance and that is why it is imperative for bodybuilders to make smart food choices have you ever seen a powerlifter do cardio i didnt think so bodybuilders focus not only on strength training and diet but on cardio as well when losing fat or preparing for a contest are the goals of the trainee cardio is absolutely key for bodybuilders bodybuilders train with the big but also train with compound movements and isolation exercises something powerlifters fail to do dont get me wrong powerlifters do train every body part they just do it in a different manner they focus on full body lifts rather than several accessory lifts to target the muscles
MMA,removed,what you describing happens to people outside us are you using a proxy where are you connecting from in many countries you basically cant watch ufc events nor even by buying well you have to buy the local cable subscription which is yearly crazy
MMA,removed,if i buy a ufc ppv in us using a proxy from a country which has ppv disabled after will i need to use the proxy to watch the event question equivalent to if i buy a ppv in us and then travel to another country with ppv disabled will i be able to watch the event from there using local internet
MMA,removed,i dont fucking understand this i deal with this shit every fucking weekend and i dont come crying like an amerifag how fucking hard is it to skip facebook and literally fucking mma forums the day fucking after the event like fucking really we need fucking spoiler tags on a mma forum the day after a fcuking event get over yourself the fuck is this shit
MMA,removed,are you old enough to use reddit buddy
MMA,removed,tim kennedy is one of the most annoying racist homophobes on the roster sort of wanker who votes trump
MMA,removed,gayest comeback of all time
MMA,removed,you can see when he jizzes so creepy
MMA,removed,alright whos the dick who censored gabis malfunction
MMA,removed,i can comfortably say both their clits are bigger than anything im packing
MMA,removed,as in shes and would bang me and i cant do shit about it
MMA,removed,i wonder if they pulled
MMA,removed,did not score it round by round but as a whole well fuck off to pride then
MMA,removed,oh fuck off ive been into mma for years and i dont need my credibility as a fan checked by some dweeb like you tj is small enough to make he doesnt kick harder than conor who outweighs him significantly if you think that i suggest you watch more fights and stop being a mark
MMA,removed,why be a dick
MMA,removed,for reals they look like old trannies wtf
MMA,removed,one of the best haha gtfo here how was mendes able to land many shots on him then if he is so good at keeping the distance w his reach
MMA,removed,i bet deep in his ass hole is the worlds largest salt mine
MMA,removed,for sure got a piece on em
MMA,removed,could you imagine getting raped by those two im just imagining in my head a tiny petite paige vanzant with a non weight cutting big cyborg and a big gabi sandwiching her
MMA,removed,nonmma fans at the bar who are these trannies
MMA,removed,a real guys night out
MMA,removed,grabbed him by the pussy
MMA,removed,reminds me of those thai tranny contests id like to erase my memories
MMA,removed,for some reason i can imagine gabi being an absolute minx in the bedroom
MMA,removed,could you imagine a threesome with those two fucking rip your dick clean off
MMA,removed,such a low cut dress but no tits
MMA,removed,i said brazilians only because they were dominating the sport preusada and after usada they either stopped fighting or were caught or started losing or just changed body drastically just that no other reason i agree with you that the problem wasis spread everywhere
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,does laser beard removal count
MMA,removed,my point was that caught or not caught brazilian fighters were at the top pre usada after usada not so much examples of brazilian fighters that were at the top pre usada and now they arent vitor bellfort anderson silva jose aldo bigfoot wanderlei silva the first that comes to my mind
MMA,removed,leprachaun
MMA,removed,who the fook are you
MMA,removed,oh fuck off like everyone in the uk knows shit about the usa i was watching a british panel show the other day and only one of the people on it knew that the us had exactly states
MMA,removed,they sure love to boo anybody who isnt a brazilian mutt though
MMA,removed,id recommend you find a tall bridge and jump off it
MMA,removed,cool story bro tell it again
MMA,removed,he might have a point
MMA,removed,i am pretty sure their contract say they cant do that but even if that wasnt the case the sport law block them from doing that with punishments as harsh as jail because of the bets he would be making a fraud but if they fake it and no one see it through then they could get away with it still deplorable to the sport and to the fans
MMA,removed,problem is that fighters could die for mistakes like this and yes it has happened before
MMA,removed,btw ronda mother made that interview one month before ronda vs holly fight
MMA,removed,clit fucked in the butt butt
MMA,removed,manlets cant be captured in anything above fps not sure of the technical reason
MMA,removed,uhm it was not a passive aggressive post why you both say that well idk but it wasnt my intention if you want to remove it then remove it i dont want to cause trouble or problems ps i dont have any issues Â°Â° or grudges Ã¹Ã¹
MMA,removed,found the manlet
MMA,removed,you make total sense but the antiufc drama mob has spoken down vote me too you motherfuckers
MMA,removed,doesnt that also mean youre going to suffer with having to watch shitty streams
MMA,removed,i know well about putting respek on shit my for one at least spell respek right two who the fuck excuses being dark for a memelulz only a cunt
MMA,removed,maybe theyre downvoting you because you called him retarded dont act like some saint
MMA,removed,how does that have any fucking relevance to this id love to get kod by brock for im sure carwin would love to avenge his loss how the fuck does that mean anything about his comments about ariel dont be stupid
MMA,removed,lol triggered lemme know when your novel drops dawg ill be sure to not read that either hahaha
MMA,removed,gold
MMA,removed,he smoked dmt and joined joes cult motherfucker
MMA,removed,you get down votes but youre correct wapo is a news outlet composed of complete hacks
MMA,removed,everybody knows poles are bigots ask the jews
MMA,removed,no
MMA,removed,dude you and i have no connection to esther lin or the other person weve never heard of infuriating no not really
MMA,removed,i swear to god some of you people seem to live in this alternate universe where you are able to bend the truth to fit what you believe in cruz a favorite against chad mendes gtfo
MMA,removed,urobinblackmma yo dude go on this but it make a mold of your own cock and then fuck yourself with it
MMA,removed,just stream that shit best of both worlds
MMA,removed,i wasnt pretending that rockhold is an arrogant asshole and deserved the loss
MMA,removed,thats assault and battery now fuck off
MMA,removed,even if it was incorrect english which it wasnt go fuck yourself this isnt english class
MMA,removed,the only one misunderstanding is you i dont even buy that care about helwani as much as you act that you do youre just practicing the trend of whiny pretentious social outrage for the sake of arguing changeorg petitions for a journalist getting banned from the ufc dude get a life your current once sucks if you get so pissed at everything so trivial
MMA,removed,you sound like you are lol
MMA,removed,you both sound like douchebags
MMA,removed,she isnt going to literally die in the streets but her career has essentially ended stop playing this off like its not a big deal im assuming you are a fourteen year old kid whos never worked a day in his life because if this happened to you youd be freaking the fuck out
MMA,removed,and you are totally fucking illiterate once again i have said nothing about his striking ability yet you keep on bringing that up i am making a joke out of the fact that he has been getting knocked the fuck out in kickboxing left and right you are raising and defending a point that i never brought up and btw i have been training at the go fuck yourself gym for many years you are welcome to join us anytime goodbye stupid
MMA,removed,i wouldnt watch an mma event unless it was live in the arena or a ufc yeah but youre a dirty casual though
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,i dont agree but dont let these fucktards commenting put you off thinking outside the box and sharing an idea or talking point
MMA,removed,love that he deleted his reply lol what a pussy
MMA,removed,watches the highlight reels and are considering whether to go to a bar for the next ppv or not sways by a washington post article about some mma journalist they dont know exists a few minutes ago i hope you realize how dumb your post sounds
MMA,removed,dont ask how i know this but they appear to be one of the biggest producers of shemale porn in the whole world the moar you prostatestimulation know
MMA,removed,the ufc acts like a czar journalist are supposed to report they need to find their own internal leaks as has been stated i could easily stream if i wanted i just chose to support before with
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,fook off
MMA,removed,lmao jk
MMA,removed,yeah you didnt give a shit so why should anybody do anything for you lazy useless piece of garbage
MMA,removed,how is it dumb the ufc was planning the reveal of brock and ariel went and spoiled it i made it a simple analogy so that even a simpleton like you can managed to understand
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,they dont need a precedent its not the rule of law its a business relationship you can dump your gf cause she keeps pissing you off by squeezing your toothpaste wrong when you tell her you dont like it like that ariel has been pissing off the ufc by doing early releases and poking at other things they dont like you dont have to suck their dick but if you keep poking them in the eye when theyre responsible for your income then its on you when they tell you to fuck off also kurt shilling i think got fired for stupid shit on twitter dumber things have happened
MMA,removed,dont buy ppv just watch on those free streams in protest
MMA,removed,he seems like a guy that would be in a parking lot bar fight and talk shit but instead of saying suck my dick hed end up saying imma suck your dick and then everyone goes wait what and then he throws a question mark kick while everyone is still confused
MMA,removed,yeah i need some good free streams
MMA,removed,nah im just summarizing your conversation its not my fault that a simple recap of one of your posts is all it takes to make you look like an ass
MMA,removed,looks like a rape attempt
MMA,removed,urobinblackmma you always annoyed me and i didnt enjoy listening to you and i never understood rmmas love for you but seeing you here and mentioning in interview seemed okay tolerable but this is pathetic you have issues go fuck yourself

MMA,removed,win or lose bisping always finds a way to worm into his opponents head he doesnt have the charisma of a mcgregor the comic timing of sonnen or the street cred of the diaz bros but he trash talks like he fights constantly and with seemingly endless stamina
MMA,removed,how can i best deal with a tranny that wont leave i want to just choke her out then put her outside but what if it can fight

MMA,removed,for anyone not in the us
MMA,removed,he was not being serious you dick sucka
MMA,removed,i think it was a great show of respect the trilogy is over now their beef can be put to rest
MMA,removed,dom is a giant dickhead loner it shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone that he acted like an asshole at any time hes said that he doesnt trash talk he just tells the truth hes not like bisping or mcgregor hes not talking smack with an undercurrent of respect or playing the game hes just a genuine dickhead why do you think he has no friends in the vlogs and wanders around like a prowler stealing peoples flowers with his dog its going to become more and more obvious that hes a wanker as time goes on and then rmma will hate him as much as i do one day
MMA,removed,youre a homeless gambler now
MMA,removed,like that clip where faber lightly says were gonna get you some fans and dom immediately looks furious and flies off the handle saying fuck you like the guy just tried to rape him and then starts insulting him even more in a disgusting way hes just a piece of shit and i hope he already has catastrophic cte

MMA,removed,gotta feed the jew
MMA,removed,we just sacrificed kimbo for this
MMA,removed,just shut the fuck up we are in mourning right now rip kimbo
MMA,removed,kids raised by single moms generally come out way worse than kids raised with both parents much more likely to break the law and go to prison they even have studies to prove the number one factor that affects how empathetic children grow up to be is how much time they spend with their dad also go fuck yourself with a rake
MMA,removed,inthevipcom nsfw will never be the same again
MMA,removed,fuck off look at his tweets you dunce

MMA,removed,too bad it couldnt be dana white who died
MMA,removed,shut up seth you asshole why the hell would you say that
MMA,removed,if you enjoy watching it you will pick up fighters different styles and techniques jiu jitsu is very technical most people just think the fighters are stalling when they are setting up positions same with greco roman wrestling which us grappling using the upper body as for the cost i started watching years ago when i was broke in college you can find online streams or videos the day after the fight if you know where to look
MMA,removed,damn two gorillas in one week
MMA,removed,are you the world is grey not black and white principle is informed by circumstance neither is sufficient by itself
MMA,removed,hendo knocked out lombard with a rape selfdefense elbow
MMA,removed,kimbo just was a very likeable guy or at least the kimbo we saw on tv its sad even when an ass hole dies but you cant help but feel a little bit more so when that person made you smile
MMA,removed,nosenose nose nose nose nose nose seriously ariel was very well spoken nose
MMA,removed,stfu
MMA,removed,ive never paid for a ufc eventi torrent themwatch them on streams and im not about to start now whatd the ufc think was gonna happen that no one would care about them banning for life the most wellknown mma reporter ariel helwani
MMA,removed,dude was a fucking gorilla a beast immagine to fight him he would eat you alive man
MMA,removed,thats the third gorilla in a week
MMA,removed,regardless you clowns sticking up for journalism because a guy is spoiling fight announcements are silly acting like the dude is exposing political corruption or human rights abuses lol
MMA,removed,agree hes way too asbergers to fake all that
MMA,removed,probably intense as fuck like every scene he has on peaky fucking blinders the traveling jew
MMA,removed,was kimbo a sacrifice to the mma gods did he die so that ariel could continue to trane ufc ufc is coming are we prepared for the flood of wwe fans or will the many faced injury god harm another knee its only been one day this week how are we going to survive the next four
MMA,removed,kimbo died so ariel could be reborn
MMA,removed,the dude has a superstar look to him hope he somehow develops a skill set to go along with it
MMA,removed,what shit are you talking about exactly having an elite level amateur wrestler who knocked out randy completely pounded a high level grappler like mir into the ground who came back in a spectacular after getting his shit kicked in by shane who brings in more money than conor back in the ufc the only shit i see is your fucking comment dummy
MMA,removed,you know we were talking about favorites and when you discuss such subjective things mentioning the reasons why you like or dislike someone is extremely relevant in short shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,shut up fucktard
MMA,removed,thats exactly how things used to work before the reebok deal jackass
MMA,removed,ariel was basically that person who finds out your wife is pregnant then posts on fbtwitter that you have a baby coming making the announcement before you could after you already printed out all of the cards did a photo shoot wanted to let your parents and inlaws know first etc you let him know youre pissed and to never do it again next year when you have your second child he does the same shit then is pissed that he is not invited to the baby shower etc sure you could say well they were going to find out eventually but for the parents it has a lot of meaning to make the announcement
MMA,removed,one would be an idiot then
MMA,removed,i still cant believe they have computers in brazil
MMA,removed,take that stick out of your ass i thought it was funny and shared it
MMA,removed,dae dana is literally hitler
MMA,removed,how many more lbs and less years did he have on randy cmon
MMA,removed,oh fuck off you think tmz gets invited to heidi klums birthday parties
MMA,removed,most likely this info came from dana rogan talked about it and then right after went on to talk about how hes friends with dana and trust him whos word do you think is worth more ariel or danas for shits and giggles lets say its true where are these fired employees zuffa trying to take the moral highground here is fucking ridiculous dana is an asshole has always been an asshole and will forever be an asshole ps frank and lorenzo are cunts as well
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,mistaken identity or retarded
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,sign me up unzip pants
MMA,removed,youre very stupid that record has more to do with diazs stubbornness and disregard for strategy being a point fighter dude is a fucking animal and if you catch him on the wrong day youre going to have a bad time
MMA,removed,fuck off so hard
MMA,removed,hey op go fuck yourself you insensitive prick
MMA,removed,op it must be fucking hard to be that dunb
MMA,removed,what a bunch sisy bullshit if he died from cocaine or heroin there would be a widely acceptable uproar against drug use and you know it i didnt know him personally but he got paid to be in the mainstream and if you cheat to do so then later die because of said bad choices i wouldnt want anyone to look up to these guys realizing as an adult all the athletes you look up to are liars and cheaters im not going to glorify their cheating and it need to be dealt with hes not the first person to die from steroid use
MMA,removed,i dont have any for those who cheat and profit off of it
MMA,removed,mostly he hates jews
MMA,removed,i dont have any respect for cheaters and people who have there manager pick easy fights to avoid being exposed plus he made plenty of money he doesnt need my respect
MMA,removed,god what a little bitch

MMA,removed,this is the easiest fight i can really think of at mw for him lombard has been absolute garbage since his return of ped suspension
MMA,removed,ah fuck you too buddeh mark fought roided monsters almost exclusively outside of the ufc never complained hes a joke
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off this thread then u peice of shit u think we need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling us about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of her
MMA,removed,or kick it in the face once
MMA,removed,i use these almost exact words when i have to makeshift something
MMA,removed,a novelty druggie and fellow roganist hypemaggot his fight with royler made him and not much after that
MMA,removed,nope only his child
MMA,removed,democrats have emboldened the lgbt community it was rare for gay men to be this aggressive against straight men before obama
MMA,removed,speaking of besides illegal streams is there anyway to watch the card over here in europe i want to drink wine at and watch people punch each other
MMA,removed,i meant with my dick but maybe cyborg fucked her after they fought
MMA,removed,its fighting of course its going to cause injury why watch it at all if their safety is all you care about im not even talking about my entertainment you pretentious pussy these fighters want to comeback it is their choice they dont need some nerds who have no idea about their health saying they shouldnt fight somehow im the selfish one for supporting a fighter making their comeback i legit didnt even mention my entertainment i just said im sick of people on here speculating about peoples health like they actually have any insight or qualifications to make that judgement
MMA,removed,maybe its a little offtopic but does cory andeson have the most severe case of gyno in the ufc the mans got the nips of a pregnant woman pictures for reference
MMA,removed,i bet hes thumbed at least one muffler in there
MMA,removed,yes im sure those high rez photos are from her iphonedefinitely and you trolls on here who mass downvote dont suprise me this is one of the worst subreddit on reddit and i cringe everytime i see a celebrity andor high profile fighter post on here and waste their time interacting with the likes of yous
MMA,removed,fedor hit him so hard he turned gay
MMA,removed,oh wow sounds like such a tough job not being able to use autofocus of the time how do you manage s
MMA,removed,here is a for anyone that doesnt want to visit that site
MMA,removed,idk how the whole sport being racist gels with jones being a piece of shit and some guys still bending over backwards to tongue his asshole but seriously i honestly dont doubt that woodley catches a shit ton of genuinly racist heat over social media we can sit here and say no we dont like you because but i guarantee theres guys running around pestering him who actually dont like him because hes black and let him know all the time so i cant blame him if thats what sticks with him anyone creating things will tell you one negative comment drowns out positive comments
MMA,removed,are you sure you arent sucking woodleys dick and if you think joe rogan is racist then you have some problems there is a difference between comedy and commentating woodley has stated that rogan while commentating in the capacity of his job at ufc is racist not his comedy read up before you comment
MMA,removed,yeah thats live im not paying to watch this tho i stream them all anyway but still
MMA,removed,fuck you
MMA,removed,well they can fucking stay there and we can take all their ugly language signs down fuck quebec the rest of the country hates your fucking guts
MMA,removed,i think you know a lot of assholes whose fucking business is it what you eat
MMA,removed,the russian hammerfist
MMA,removed,you also have toronto an hour away
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,except then he can never fight again not be able to support his family this was all in the article toodo you even read
MMA,removed,yeah except rockhold helped him up the first time they fought and raised his hand
MMA,removed,the dirtiest fighters in mma gilbert is first on the list
MMA,removed,affect
MMA,removed,blow me dick
MMA,removed,see you soon boi lmfao he had all the energy in the world to fight gsp but as soon as yoel comes into the title picture he is nowhere to be seen or heard from again people are okay with this i cant believe this pussy bitch isnt more reviled for the pussy bitch he is
MMA,removed,this guy pissed me off the entire time i couldnt tell if he was just an asshole or a massive retard because he seemed a bit of both still ive been put in leglocks and if someone held on to one too long i would be incredibly mad
MMA,removed,he literally called rockhold a faggot
MMA,removed,people like you are why civilized human beings hate conor fans
MMA,removed,rmmastreams
MMA,removed,chaels dead kid tho
MMA,removed,it will most likely end in tko or ko so you are going to be a sad man also to my homies who are broke httpcricfreesc hit more click on ufc then click on the eventat the right time of course only exception is that you have adblock turned off for their site only which i find fair i get to watch fights they get my ads is normal also once you pick the event there is like channels to pick from if your stream is lagging at all the links will be right above the player hope this helps some poor guy like me
MMA,removed,fook off promoting your shit here
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,about as bad as having a flair to your shit prediction sub were you boast about having wrong half the time
MMA,removed,i bet youre one of those betas who are whiteknighting jenna jameson on twitter today
MMA,removed,i dont take any pleasure from this but you make me want to list all your transgressions
MMA,removed,are you
MMA,removed,how about you shut the fuck up and keep it moving
MMA,removed,you sad that your bitch conor got slapped
MMA,removed,holy shit can you read we all fucking know that he wants to make money were not talking about that were talking about what his legacy as a fighter will be and how he can forge it this is like hitting my head against a brick wall every time this topic comes up you get some mouthbreather who just incessantly repeats yeah but conor wants money hurr durr as if it has anything to do with the topic at hand and is some kind of novel information that none of us have stumbled across we fucking know he wants money
MMA,removed,i dont care spends hours regurgitating mcgregor talking points
MMA,removed,lmao stfu
MMA,removed,hes as dirty as the rest of them inadvertently taking a ped is a failure on the athletes part
MMA,removed,and still here you are bashing my fandom because i dont like attempted murder get a life dude some people are going to have different opinions than your own and you are going to just have to accept that
MMA,removed,reported
MMA,removed,this fucking clown posts in the red pill just so you guys know what level iq were dealing with here have fun dying alone no matter how hard you try to act like an alpha youll always be empty inside
MMA,removed,so are you trying to say you have superstar standards i was going to call troll but bruh that post history
MMA,removed,are you fucking insane or what you legit think they have supplement suppliers put illegal steroids into their stock so that jon jones could potentially use the tainted supplement excuse and blame their company if he ever pops for peds you are fucking stupid
MMA,removed,youre an imbecile
MMA,removed,its blauna goodjob calling out the error but not saying the correct name dick
MMA,removed,tappy tappy how does connor have less power at then
MMA,removed,didnt he also pay off joey mercurys mortgage so the dude wouldnt lose his house if i buy groceries for my elderly neighbor every week but am an asshole to everyone else i encounter does my one good deed counteract everything
MMA,removed,im sure this helps a lot of people another way that works even better is if you get a vpn like private internet access change your location to hong kong there are other locations but hong kong was the cheapest i found once you go to the ufc fight pass website you can order the ppv for i can confirm that this worked on the last ppvs you do not have to have the vpn active once you pay for the ppv the stream is in perfect hd and i have never had a streaming issue additionally i believe ufc gets all the money without a middleman taking a cut so its not like illegally streaming it for free this also works to see other events that are normally on fox i forgot to dvr the holly vs valentina fight so i changed my location to a country that wasnt blacklisted and watched the whole show on fight pass
MMA,removed,ufctv and do the vpn thing the other guy is saying
MMA,removed,they probably didnt want to use a good name on a daughter thats going to in a few days
MMA,removed,fuck off then nobody gives a shit who or what you know
MMA,removed,jesus christ dont even bother downvoting this fuck its obviously what he wants
MMA,removed,i just want to make you aware of how stupid you sound bottom line is youre fucking wrong and if you disagree with me well then youre also an idiot end of story goodbye
MMA,removed,will tunnelbear chrome extension suffice
MMA,removed,private internet access is the one people really like right
MMA,removed,do the same thing but pick thailand and get it for
MMA,removed,fuck off you dork
MMA,removed,someone posted awhile back that india is the cheapest country to go through not sure if thats still the case
MMA,removed,yes it will be linked to your ufc account and i think that makes it so its english ive purchased from a few different countries and when i watch its always in english with rogan
MMA,removed,im going to call you snith duran
MMA,removed,isp for sure but i think private trackers are generally safe to use without a vpn
MMA,removed,nay you only use the vpn to purchase the fight and turn it off after ie you dont use the vpn while streaming
MMA,removed,dick head fam
MMA,removed,im perfectly fine i need no help youre simply an idiot
MMA,removed,i switched my region to hong kong and the price is listed in kh do you know if ill be able to use a prepaid visa to buy it
MMA,removed,seriously this is much better than his easter island look
MMA,removed,ah downvotes without explanations cowards children who hide behind a screen if you believe something advocate for it otherwise youre worse than an ideologue yourewell youre you the other thread was closed but i wanted to give you the reason you were downvoted there is no privilege only labels we give eachother to denegrate and virtue signal an excuse to be rotten towards others it has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with culture
MMA,removed,this is exactly what i believe and i believe the ufc wants it to happen and is setting things up for it to happen for promotions sake they trust conor to do his part and win the title so they have the intrigue of a first ever reigning twoweight champion theyve bent over so far for conor its embarrassing nate wasnt supposed to win the first time and theyre hoping conor takes it this time
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up op we dont need this kind of karma around here
MMA,removed,its because everyones on fergusons dick now you cant mention khabib and title shot without at least half the people saying something like hes only beaten one top we guy basically acting like the guy he didnt completely manhanlde in his fight before last was the same guy people were calling one of the greatest lightweights ever just a few weeks ago half the people in here are probably your stereotypical casual fan and are just parroting what other contraction dipshits say
MMA,removed,and conor retired over the internet like year old girl screaming for attention conor has no room anymore for talking shit about anyone he got his ass kicked and was going to quit because his ego couldnt handle it and he knows damn well nate will fuck him up again the time he bought in between wont help him either he should have stuck to fighting people half his size talk about a bum champ thats the definition of a bum champ
MMA,removed,im not gonna suggest anything not legal but try out rmmastreams
MMA,removed,someone wanna tell me what happened i opened the stream and security broke things up and dana said it was done
MMA,removed,such an asshole pick one
MMA,removed,because fuck your irish midget cunt dats why
MMA,removed,aw fuck up it was not staged you dickhead
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up dude you think nate or nick would agree to act all mad and get that heated and shit like some wwe shit if they approached them with that shit theyd laugh and tell everyone about it
MMA,removed,also an idiot
MMA,removed,mannn if rmma starts licking nates balls and doesnt complain about him throwing the first water bottle then it really shows who the real nuthuggers are here
MMA,removed,well better grammar thats for sure its there not their first of all and what the fuck you got to offer go take care of your toothache little bitch made boi
MMA,removed,oooo nates sooo coool and badass rmma would be going on a lynch mob if this was mcgregor
MMA,removed,nobody likes u cunts lmao this pleb is all ur shitty dogshit country has going for u hahha go anal fuck a potato u motherfucker
MMA,removed,lol how is conor talking shit he got fuckin finished was no fluke ko no accidental leg break how is this fucktard have the gull to talk shit
MMA,removed,fuck off with this dick riding bullshit have you never seen the diaz bros before their fights if conor walked out it would be the same excuse of conor is trying to get into his head
MMA,removed,only cause that fuckin leprechaun was late
MMA,removed,sure that dirty mick isnt racist its just funny
MMA,removed,at the end of the youtube stream someone off camera says i threw it right back at him they are probably talking about the bottle that comes flying back at nate after he tossed his
MMA,removed,you know it takes less than seconds to create an account lmfao im laughing my ass off here your soft mind hurts when you realize that cholo gangster trash culture creates a fuck ton of crime who would have known oh right the department of justice has known
MMA,removed,i was laughing my meat off
MMA,removed,definitely has ive been to the last uk events with a lot of my friends and the starting time has been the deciding factor as to whether theyll all go our tickets for the last london event were around Â£ each but were pretty close to the cage first row in the standsthe time before that at the it was about the same for floor seats we got our manchester tickets for what was supposed to be bispingmunoz for Â£ each but they were nosebleed seats we still had a great view of the cage and could see everything pretty fucking clearly ticket wise i think the last time we got them we got priority so got them a day before general release you can also join the ufc mailing list to get them a day earlier you should be okay with buying them on the day but with it being a ppv event im not too sure how easy it will be beyond say next friday to get reasonable tickets
MMA,removed,its a fight yeah between the two of them you dickhead
MMA,removed,conors but daaad he started it face in the end is foocking priceless
MMA,removed,anyone have a link
MMA,removed,anywhere that i can watch this live living in ireland
MMA,removed,yeah i dont trust dave the autist
MMA,removed,dumbest thing ive read all day how do you think you were watching the fucking press conference you goon
MMA,removed,this is literally the exact same video from the live stream just mirrored with a shitty news paper overlay to prevent it from being taken down fuck off
MMA,removed,im aware how to google was just checking if anyone had a decent link to help avoid the rest of us swimming through a cesspool of dodgy linksstreams
MMA,removed,you seem like a cool cat hespect
MMA,removed,youre welcome to fuck off
MMA,removed,diaz and his gang are white trash
MMA,removed,plenty of streams but im not going to post them here pretty easy to find a stream if you simply google espn streaming you can use their watch espn siteapp but you have to be subscribed to a cable network
MMA,removed,cro cop became a champion big nog a ufc champion shogun a ufc champion henderson a strikeforce champion overeem a strikeforce champion werdum a ufc champion rampage a ufc champion etc all who came from pride please drink bleach
MMA,removed,that was full blown hood rat behaviour from the diaz boys no enough glocks
MMA,removed,thats because youre a pussy you have no problem watching two guys destroy themselves in the octagon for your amusement but you get butthurt watching said guys throw bottles at each other from a distance lmao gift
MMA,removed,shut up beaner
MMA,removed,i would hit her with my dick
MMA,removed,just end it all bud
MMA,removed,i reckon it was intentional diazs crew was shouting shit atabout conors team some of which would have been sitting with dee one of diazs crew took aim at one of conors and hit dee scumbag move really if conor walked out of a press conference and threw stuff at diazs team people on here would lose their mind
MMA,removed,considering mcnuggets girlfriend allegedlty got hit with a roll of tape thrown by the diaz camp im wondering if shields will be in his corner either
MMA,removed,i thought you were kidding you honestly think the only people at in that whole building who couldve possible flooded a bathroom are the diaz brothers why not i dont know some drunk asshole or a kid fucking around remind me not to hire you as a private investigator
MMA,removed,thats awful cheal is a cunt for being a cheat but this is just heartbreaking i hope he has a good support system for this i cant imagine how this feels fuck man
MMA,removed,i guess mcgregor threw the water bottle a bit too hard
MMA,removed,dammit bruce
MMA,removed,its only a wall graffiti will be fine i hope you are under the age of because thats the logic of retards its property dont go around fucking it up
MMA,removed,haha you actually reported my comment wow
MMA,removed,nates sooo cool mom hes like in a gang and stuff he threw a bottle at that irish leprechaun guy
MMA,removed,he cheated to give other brain damage this should be brought up whenever chael is mentioned
MMA,removed,wonder how many people died in syria today can we get a flair for that too
MMA,removed,he sounded optimistic about his fight with rashad too and we all saw what an abortion that turned out to be
MMA,removed,psa you can save on ppvs by visiting rmmastreams around fight time
MMA,removed,you reported a comment bro hahaha did you please tell me you didnt

MMA,removed,in ages shad last fight was in april against glover wft are you smoking
MMA,removed,it means that you need to get a life
MMA,removed,so he can fight as a real mc gregor is the money fight and it is in his best interest to win size and strength really make a difference in grappling so it would make sense he would bulk up and such that he walks around and then cut to and good cardio is a diaz signature trait ya dusty ass motherfuckers
MMA,removed,you guys are assholes
MMA,removed,you get to make a porno starring any two ufc fighters who do you choose
MMA,removed,do a vlog where pat eats your ass
MMA,removed,his arms are the perfect length to jerk off conor with
MMA,removed,you have a vagina so that kind of ramparts shit is accepted
MMA,removed,probably because a hes not a fighter anymore and doesnt give a shit b if he wanted advice on his boxing he would ask a boxing coachnot a cheeto fingered redditer
MMA,removed,do u fuck dat ass
MMA,removed,after he destroyed an entire division i get what youre saying but he didnt destroy the entire division thats one of the reasons why everyone wants him to actually defend his damn belt
MMA,removed,who gives a fuck its his money his ticket his seat while you lot sit here and smirk and then masturbate in to a cup afterwards because your lives are empty
MMA,removed,im gonna assume a lot of the wrestlers were told to respond so wwe would look relevant
MMA,removed,holy shit i never knew these loser he would talk about on the show actually existedyou actually took your time and went to his page to tell him that wowsort out your priorities man
MMA,removed,what the fuck is this shit why post this garbage anywhere
MMA,removed,it is its all to do with the new bt deal and the bidding war between eir and virgin at the moment it wont be resolved any time soon either if at all if youre an eir customer youre sorted but if not the only option theyre giving you is illegal streaming
MMA,removed,not everywhere is as fucked as south africa

MMA,removed,so what youre saying is that shitting on lance armstong the asshole who has single headedly raised more money for cancer research than most people in human history is more important than him raising that money well to that i say fuck you
MMA,removed,i could smell the fedora a mile away
MMA,removed,no its literally not and im about to skull fuck you with an explanation you cant contort to fit your fucking narrative the atheist in a foxhole argument is used to say when someone is facing death they believe in a god because they are scared of what will happen when they die my example was a personal experience a year old kid found dead by his brother at the funeral which i was at as an athiest and left as an atheist they played a video of the kid getting baptized a month before his death now i dont think the kid is in paradise and that really doesnt even matter the comfort his family had in that moment a moment where they lost a son and a brother showed me that religion has its place that place is not in politics that place is not in public ramming it down peoples throats however if a crushed family can have any comfort on their worst day then it has its fucking place you are the stereotypical militant atheist and i hope sooner rather than later you realize the way youre acting is hurting your cause more than helping it
MMA,removed,ehm is doing porn when you shouldnt even be born for the next weeks considered childporn
MMA,removed,wow fuck you
MMA,removed,karma is a mother fucker

MMA,removed,yeah and its on too late to watch it in a pub so cant even do that someone linked to a setanta go app which might be an option but the site are cagey on bitrate and buffering so could be worse than a dodgy stream
MMA,removed,haha keep waving the wrong flag loser

MMA,removed,you are autistic retard and i stand by my statement until you give me a reason not to think that
MMA,removed,no i dont i dont seem defensive at all i dont know what youre talking about fuck off

MMA,removed,you are kind of a bitch
MMA,removed,nobody is offended ive repeatedly explained to you why that is a false equivalency and you still bandy it about i have no recollection of us ever having a conversation about this and no its not a false equivalency i dont see how you could possible come to that conclusion considering there are people in this very thread offended by other people being offended nobody is advocating for sjws to lose their jobs and what relevance does that have to this situation due to what they perceive as poor word choice i see youre trying very hard to tiptoe around the word racism theyre trying to speak out against people empathy being used as a cudgel to force them to toe a party line what party line that casual racism isnt acceptable in the context of a live sports broadcast im not exactly sure what you mean by using empathy as a cudgel how about this im asian and hearing that shit pissed me off i heard enough of it when i was one of like two asian kids in basically allwhite schools and i put up with it because i thought it made me cool even though i hated every fucking second of it now im an adult and i can actually stand up against it and make my grievance known i dont think its cool anymore to sit around while random people take cheap cracks at me because i look different fuck that and fuck you for suggesting that this is just some moral crusade that liberals are using to feel better about themselves you seem to buy into the idea that no one is ever actually offended by anything that they just pretend to be for attention i hate to pop your little bubble but thats not the case im going to take a wild stab and guess that youve never had to deal with years of being mocked for being a different ethnicity you come off as a smart guy which makes me think youre capable of better than this sort of intellectual laziness wow thats a pretty weak attempt to appeal to my ego and you can fuck off with this intellectual laziness crap because youre the one handwaving this away as if its not a real issue that should be talked about honestly i appreciate that youre not a complete mouth breather like some of the hopeless motherfuckers in this thread but im not going to sit here and pretend like youre presenting anything resembling a cogent argument
MMA,removed,ari has so much cum squirt in those eyes you cant see whats right in front of your faceamanda daniels takes joe silva leaves that job vince dana is fucked and im fucked which means were all fucked and were fucked in the way you like to get fucked not fucked in the way normal people like to get fucked

MMA,removed,your point was when fighters contemplate retirement their career goes downhill how is what she did before that even relevant she contemplated retirement then won the title after seeing this and your comments on other posts you sir are an idiot
MMA,removed,miguel torres how ironic that after your last post you had to go to a kick boxing match in a ring and it still doesnt fit the description of a significant injury surely you are aware that miguel fought again months later significant knee injuries take years to rehab ask dominic cruz and derrick rose rampage complete bullshit rampage has been complaining about knee injuries from pride and he even still has never sat out a significant amount of time since the jones fight due to knee injuries he took another fight months after the jones fight but lets humor you and accept those two fights for the sake of argument there have still been zero careers ended due to oblique kicks which is the constant claim with you people yet there been lives ended from regular run of the mill head strikes
MMA,removed,heres what you said black people are much less likely to be shot by police than white people even when you adjust for population and heres what your source says from to whites died by being shot by police compared to blacks more whites are killed by the police than blacks primarily because whites outnumber blacks in the general population by more than five to one forst said the country is about percent white and percent black your own source makes it clear that the raw numbers do not account for the disparity in population
MMA,removed,this is the dude who said everyone should be on steroids because the sport wont be exiting with out it shut the fuck up

MMA,removed,it was a play on malkis stupid date rape analogy autist
MMA,removed,kg is lbs so if a fighter walked around at that weight hed probably cut down to about by the end of a two month camp hed then cut the rest lbs during fight week if you cut from lbs to during fight week lbs that would be a very dramatic weight cut
MMA,removed,its probably water im sure she downed a shit ton of water pedialyte and coconut water the rest is food but probably not as much as youd think
MMA,removed,god the squad are such a bunch of goons
MMA,removed,dufresne missed weight by lbs which is bullshit that takes away from the upset imo
MMA,removed,i still think meek beating paul harris is the upset of the year that was a complete shock harris was murdering top fighters in wsof and the ufc then gets kod by a complete noname
MMA,removed,hawt you think im going to let you sit here and tittie fuck me
MMA,removed,fuck off marc

MMA,removed,the black guys usually gas
MMA,removed,he did it right too one warning then a point should be for eyepokes and nut shots

MMA,removed,its a day ban in order to vet do some research
MMA,removed,dana is friends with trump hell get the private jet treatment

MMA,removed,i bought he was danish lmao s traitor to iran now face the harsh reality
MMA,removed,hes undefeated against his wife
MMA,removed,ewww
MMA,removed,as a trump supporter this is complete and utter bullshit the ban is only temporary days and the main reason for it is because the current state of immigration control is awful the plan is to get the uscis to a healthy state and then deal with the refugees also dana and trump are close friends
MMA,removed,this is ridiculous
MMA,removed,and where was all the due outrage when we were bombing the shit out of of those countries and producing the refugees and would be immigrants that we are now so up in arms about not being allowed to visit something something terrorism something something freedom and fuck islam
MMA,removed,i was antisjw and on trump now me being muslim and all with rather discriminatory laws being laid against me and my community i have boarded the sjw train you better check your privilege bitch i am coming with a loud speaker while chewing my vegan sandwich

MMA,removed,wellcub swanson is pretty antitrump
MMA,removed,mousasi is also a christian
MMA,removed,i swear to god rmmas got a mental deficiency where rondas fight win streak was just a complete accident and not because she was the superior fighter tip ronda doesnt have to be a good striker or a good person to be a skilled combatant
MMA,removed,we need to give trump a chance we gave obama a chance and hes black
MMA,removed,some fucked up tweets
MMA,removed,christians are also infinitely less likely to be islamists
MMA,removed,bisping seems pretty rational to be honest
MMA,removed,but trumps a racist therefore his bans are different and thats what makes him racist there are so many real issues with trump people need to stop focusing on bullshit ones
MMA,removed,holy valentina me gusta
MMA,removed,trump is mad that hispanic immigrants laid out two of his republican buddies
MMA,removed,titties
MMA,removed,king trump i dont like the guy but at least he doesnt give a fuck what people think
MMA,removed,i think that when sex appeal becomes so nescessary in a profession that really doesnt have much to do with sex appeal in the first place there is something wrong with either the company or with the fanbase that creates the demand thanks for letting us know oh great and virtuous moral compass
MMA,removed,that dumb year old bitch who doesnt understand cage fighting like i do what a cunt she gay or something

MMA,removed,yeah everyone whos ever studied tapes of their opponent is a shit fighter i agree i know that was your bros fight and hes still fighting amateur a couple years later you can tell by looking at the guy hes never been there before it was obvious he was scared especially after he got head kicked amateur fights should be left for amatuers trying to get better so they can turn pro they shouldnt be for dickheads who dont want to move up and only want to head kick people who are below their skill level around the world go ahead and downvote this one too fruitcake i do not give a single fuck but i hope it makes you feel better than your buddy after kicking a stationary target in the face
MMA,removed,links or it didnt happen oh wait you cant because youre afraid of taking a head kick we both know hed enjoy the fuck out of kicking someone who doesnt want to fight and is scared by the way he posts up on the ropes after he knocks the dude down youre even worse than him for posting it and then bringing up the traveling as an amateur and multiple belts get off his nutsack
MMA,removed,well turns out watching fox news doesnt keep you too informed jews and christians have guaranteed seats in the parliament and yes they are citizens of the country

MMA,removed,hes the first prospect in that division in a while other than derrick lewis who i believe is probably less marketable his crazy submission and knock outs all lend to the idea that he is a contender in the division the rest is hype but i do believe ngannou could become champion and while overeem is a better striker hes weaker slower and has a glass chin
MMA,removed,most of them arent so its just fair
MMA,removed,dumb
MMA,removed,can you just fuck off
MMA,removed,rightbecause you cunting your friends out of is the same thing as ronda making substantial improvements to the wmma landscape and in fact bringing it to the mainstream ive heard of ronda unless youre one of the founders of one of the major sites or a high level pro youre a fucking joke ronda may be an asshole but youre a fucking tool to compare your success to hers in any way im not a ronda fan but shes shit out more grappling knowledge than youve ever possessed and youre likely a worse striker

MMA,removed,old fat gorillas can still rip you in half
MMA,removed,fuck off he said he was gonna send them back on the monday after ariel got fired so he finally got around to it dont spin this he voluntarily gave up his creds and probably sent a strongly worded letter to go along with them that called them all rapists and telling them hes seen the evidence its damning so yeah he probably got banned if the ever unreliable frb and botter subordinate is to be believed after he sent his press pass back

MMA,removed,are you attempting jokes you havent written weeks in advance
MMA,removed,thats not what i said at all read the first sentence i said he was dominant dipshit dominance can be boring especially if a fighter is content on coasting most of the fight on points like cruz dont pretend that dom doesnt have a point fighting style he doesnt take risks when he can keep scoring all fight safely on the outside normally he completely shuts guys down and hits them at will without getting hit at all still dom didnt look impressive at all against faber he didnt do much damage and didnt do what a champion should do to an underserving challenger he could barely crack fabers defense the whole fight but was unhittable so he won he was unhittable but couldnt get many of his own hits in
MMA,removed,youre an absolute fucking idiot im tired of people like you completely revising the history of the sport due to your ignorance the ufc did not properly lay claim to mmas heavyweight division until they absorbed strikeforce rings had the hw division until pride took over as after the ufc bought pride affliction held the best hw division after that strikeforce finally after that the ufc now has claim to the best heavyweight division in mma
MMA,removed,you really resort to insults a lot and yes he ripped off retirees and seniors but you only heard about it because he ripped off rich people dont bother responding punk im gonna make a toilet meatloaf and go to bed
MMA,removed,german french and irish here youre close to having the perfect combo
MMA,removed,youre punching above your weight with that girl

MMA,removed,if conor rousey and brock are all on the same card itll get about million buys max still a shit ton but nowhere near maypac level
MMA,removed,thats my feeling as well theyll try and make it up to us
MMA,removed,he specifically asked for the rematch
MMA,removed,its because most mma fans are pieces of trash that watch on illegal streams before their shifts at their low paying jobs
MMA,removed,yeah and has nothing to do with being scared
MMA,removed,dont be silly sonnen cant ejaculate after all that trt
MMA,removed,the guy youre talking to is a really butt hurt mcgregor fan boy who says outlandish claims about diaz so people will shit on nate its scary pathetic
MMA,removed,you need a tissue lad grow a pair ya soft boiled egg theyre only words no wonder you think conor is king kong
MMA,removed,thanks man i suppose you were watching it on fightpass or is there any other stream you were using
MMA,removed,the quote illustrates that alvarez doesnt have a good grasp of what is going on in mma that literally shows that alvarez the champ knows less than you or i unless you also think mcgregor is a lightweight game recognizes game stop saying retarded shit like that adults dont talk like that game set match cerrone is top tier stop fucking pretending to end our conversation and then responding to me you come off as unintelligent and immature
MMA,removed,you dont come across as someone who is working with a full box of crayons i hope you have a nice weekend
MMA,removed,waaaaaaahhhh
MMA,removed,whoah there
MMA,removed,now thats one girl that id like to lay n pray
MMA,removed,oh cool youre the type of person who likes to throw out the term white knight you people usually have great insights into things
MMA,removed,hahahahaha dip shit i fucking told you
MMA,removed,lol i love the argument that because fanboys are downvoting me you can change the definition of a term you are seriously pathetic dude how old are you
MMA,removed,just shut up
MMA,removed,mercedes is the best that said i think everyone on rmma man or woman would want to get into the north south position with her
MMA,removed,ufc he din do muffin
MMA,removed,done
MMA,removed,also youre arguing that woodley couldnt make a weightclass thats below his current weightclass do you really think he couldnt get to by losing some muscle just fuck off with this retarded argument dude cyborg could make the weight if she werent a cheater and didnt want to keep the benefits of her cheating
MMA,removed,oh my god im not talking about cutting weight im talking about losing weight theres a difference
MMA,removed,youre the one stating the obvious you moron hall outsmarted grayson and some of you re salty as fuck about it brains beat muscle every time get over it

MMA,removed,unzips now listen here op i want you to suck my dick and suck it good ok
MMA,removed,anyone remember when luke was active here and started calling people fatidiotsretards ill try finding the comments if they arent deleted
MMA,removed,so because you and i share different opinions im fan boy does that make you a fan bitch because you seem to be emotionally tied to that fight too except youre crying about it like a bitch so fan bitch i dont give a fuck if ryan hall is a ranked ufc fighter or not i dont care if he wins or loses i dont even care if other fight fans didnt enjoy his style but as a fight fan myself that fight was hilarious to watch and i was entertained the entire time if you dont like that youre free to go fuck yourself gray was terrified to go near a grounded opponent and he was embarrassed on the feet too embarrassed by a guy with amateur level striking and elementary school striking power how about that ryan shut him down talked shit to him the while fight and made a fool of him there was nothing gray maynard could do about it nothing just like there was nothing you could do about from your couch last time i checked it was a fight and maynard was losing on points so go kick his fucking ass maynard what was he waiting for he was laying right there
MMA,removed,melendez was just about the biggest name outside of the ufc at the time many outlets had him listed as the or lightweight in the world
MMA,removed,ryan hall is a competitor and owes us nothing are you deluded or just stupid he owes us entertainment thats what hes paid for also under a different set of rules hed have his head stomped all over the cage flopping onto his back like that is playing to rules to his advantage
MMA,removed,you are saying this but probably have a good cry every time someone puts one of their points on the ground to defend a knee
MMA,removed,youre still talking about stuff i addressed in my first posts go do worm guard on your body pillow queer
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,gsp vs johny hendricks mcgregor vs nate diaz mighty mouse vs tj dillashaw jon jones vs gustafson cerrone vs gunnar nelson mark hunt vs pat barry dariush vs michael johnson

MMA,removed,right you are aware to the full ignorance of my knowledge to the ground game bc of my statement its flopping bc hes just falling after a strike trying to bait and trick him he falls to the ground and has no chance of bringing him to the ground other than baiting or tricking him into thinking hes hurt if he had done it a cpl times to no success thats fine but he did a ton to no success which is what made it so disgustingly dirty and pathetic oh and thanks for explaining why he didnt engage to his guard captain obvious being so ignorant about the ground idk what i wouldve done had you not explained that to me
MMA,removed,mmastreams bro i only use fightpass to watch some older fights

MMA,removed,stop putting pussy on a pedestal its so beta
MMA,removed,i dunno the image of a highly tanned man with a pale twink has stuck in my mind might be from some of those pictures of brian singers parties
MMA,removed,hes literally in the most competitive weight class in the sport hes not a great fighter comes down to the definitions of goodgreat and you being a smug little asshole trying to belittle fighters who are a million leagues above yourself just because they have losses to other great fighters

MMA,removed,uh dumbdumb were talking about women your experience as a straight man has no relevance go get a haircut
MMA,removed,following namajunas remarks of being done crying done not sleeping at night after her contest with tecia torres thugs headcoach trevor wittman decided it was time to pull her fiancÃ© and former ufc competitor pat barry back from camp in attempt to give the no strawweight a bit more focus heading into her contest having that emotional involvement is too much assessment i think we ran into that with the last fight hes a very emotional guy its a little much high energy its a cool thing getting her hyped up but on an energy level we needed to keep it focused one thing when it comes to a corner when youre speaking high or speaking low you always want to be able to assess the energy of a fight sometimes a coach needs to cool you down sometimes a coach needs to wake you up sometimes a coach needs to piss you off but when theres nonstop high energy that makes you fight nonstop high energy i wouldnt say its a bad thing but at this level we needed to have everything toned in
MMA,removed,wtf kind of retarded response is this

MMA,removed,now trying to pretend to be a grown man you think a grown man goes out there bragging about having cash you hobbies are as ridiculous as your character i mean look at you you are obviously a kid that got mad cause i told you a fact which is assuming that you paid for the payperview it makes you bucks short you got defensive because in your kiddie mind thats offensive you and your hobbies are immature and deserves to made fun of
MMA,removed,i usually hate when people read too much into the hes in his head type nonsense but if i were to add one thing to what you listed off there nate diaz does not get rattled by trash talk or boos or any of that shit i feel like mcg still enjoys a slight advantage over some of his opponents just because he manages to make them loathe him so much if i remember right aldo even said i wasnt afraid of losing he just didnt want to lose to him that affects how these guys fight i think nate on the otherhand was out there thinking this little fuckin leprechaun just tagged me but ima get em next round
MMA,removed,you are seriously comparing ali and his articulate wit to connor and his gutter level trash talk lol
MMA,removed,oh the game plan fuck off what game plan had you masterminded
MMA,removed,conor taking a shit is more exciting than your lame existence lmao
MMA,removed,im surprised its on by default ive never seen one for any stream that didnt have racial slurs and ascii swastikaspenisesmarijuana leaves

MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,it was broadcast uncut where i am so i am sure if you torrent it or stream the fight from elsewhere it will be there
MMA,removed,so if you are the owner of a bussiness and your employee who is under contract starts running around your ofice like a mad man exclaiming he wants more money you just bow down and do as he pleases

MMA,removed,you mad
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,we have this same conversation literally every time one of his fights end he goes from being entertainment conor to regular conor people actually think that he isnt intentionally doing what he does and acting how he acts for attention and entertainment purposes lol theres a reason he brings in so much money he knows exactly what he is doing as does any intelligent person familiar with sports event promoting he has shown repeatedly that he cares about fellow fighters team mates and always shows sportsmanship after fights just look at him and nate they obviously like each other at the end of the day but if they decided to do the trilogy you better believe they are going to pretend to have bad blood and hilarious arguments where conor acts even more ridiculous the fucking children who actually hate him for how he acts are about as dumb as the people who hate on pro wrestling heels they dont understand that its all a part of the show its why the show is so big its why so many people watch conor also raises the stock of all fighters on cards with him and fighter pay in general because of all the attention he is bringing to mma more attention to mma more fans ticket sales and ppv buys higher average negotiated fighter pay anyone who doesnt get how good of an influence this is having on the sport is a retard and anyone who thinks conor is serious is a retard
MMA,removed,this has nothing to do with me wanting brain damage your comment was about being a little bitch if you cant take shit talk so i put you in the exact situation aldo was in so yeah i did read what i typed before clicking save now im waiting for you to read it so youll actually respond to what i said
MMA,removed,what an idiot
MMA,removed,anyone browsing this site right now trying to avoid spoilers is an idiot
MMA,removed,i love conor but khabib will rape the shit out of him
MMA,removed,top kek do you really think aldo would have a chance vs eddie at all do you honestly think he could make it minutes vs conor if you do youre the casual
MMA,removed,pics or gtfo
MMA,removed,its like those obnoxious retarded people who think theyre free to be racist and generally an asshole because they voted for trump they feel vindicated ill still be glad when conor retires but its going to be annoying to have to listen to dumbshits who dont know anything go on like this actually was a historic moment when anyone who knows their shit knows better
MMA,removed,public enemy or go fuck your mother
MMA,removed,stfu
MMA,removed,youre obviously a very spiteful unhappy person just be happy for connor and stop being so closeminded

MMA,removed,that man is a silverback leaving its enclosure
MMA,removed,are you even reading what im writing i said the dos anjos fight was impressive the pettis and melendez fight wasnt impressive given the level those two guys were fighting at the time a long with the fact that they were lackluster split decisions
MMA,removed,hell no diaz v kabob diaz will smoke that oberrated fuck then it will be diaz connor for belt maybe let connor fight his fw belt aging aldo and rape him in seconds
MMA,removed,wtf dude you keep assuming so much out of me youre just making stuff up to argue against if youre not a nuthugger i dont know who is you sound crazy
MMA,removed,conor is great and all but this comment is absolutely retarded woodley made lawler eat shit in one round and the guy looks like a comic book hero one punch is all he needs for conor to see the shadow realm mcgregors class is lw hes selling wolf tickets he knows he doesnt belong in ww
MMA,removed,part of the craft of fighting is not disqualifying yourself from competition and not cancelling a fight because of a change in opponent actually its totally not the craft of fighting is the craft of fighting not promoting not being a white person from a market that the ufc is looking to break into not making money etc you can be a dickhead and still be the best fighter of all time

MMA,removed,have a look through my comments and youll see eventually comments related to my travels in morocco egypt jordan iran uae turkey malaysia indonesia and two muslim regions on top of all that southern thailand and western nepal but i see that im wasting my time with a paranoid halfwit who thinks there is some conspiracy by jews to make muslims look bad okay never mind verses or hadiths that mean death for apostasy its all the jews handiwork
MMA,removed,he couldnt have known because it was a mistake that it was even in his supplement to begin with again ill aay the fucking professional drug testing agency agrees with that fact your incessant bitching changes nothing at all he is top get over it

MMA,removed,when this guy kicked your ass httpiimgurcomnbosbgnjpg did you consider becoming a democrat
MMA,removed,with all due respect i disagree with pretty much all of that you make it sound as if joness presence in the ufc will prevent another talent like jones from being discovered which i can promise you is categorically false the ufc have and will continue to find the best talent to put on the card and if nothing else i want a talent like john jones around to challenge those folks again i feel like a bunch of people here are making their disdain of jon jones personal this is not personal you do not know jon jones he did nothing to you and if he is the greatest then it is a waste to have him not using his talent accordingly permanently banning the best talent in the world because they are morons does not make the ufc greater not one bit just like not having fedor in the ufc devalued the heavyweight division not having jon devalues lhw whether you like him or not
MMA,removed,a few too many coloured people on the card not trump enough

MMA,removed,has fought at lhw more recently has more wins at mw in the past years than silva has fights anderson silvas last win was october since then he has four losses and a no contest due to testing positive for multiple banned substances nb mousasi has not tested positive for same mousasi is over the same span with finishes if you want to talk about who the ufc thought would be the best name to put on the marquee to grab a few more buys and save that dumpsterfire of a card then yeah ando makes some sense but to say mousasi deserved it less than anderson that argument has downs and so do you

MMA,removed,in brazil pride was aired in combate a cable fighting channel and sometimes sportv biggest sports channel in brazil it was very underground though because it aired really late at night guys like wanderlei silva vitor belfort and the nogueiras were known but not very famous no idea i think gracie fought under somekind of special rules for that fight normal fights were min and min
MMA,removed,you gotta love the assholes who get in your face like that and when you push them away they use it as an excuse that you instigated first its the most retarded fucking shit
MMA,removed,wow the spoilers turned a potential mma story comment section to fucking gay of thrones fuck off
MMA,removed,im a bit confused at how nonjapanese people were watching these early pride events most of the events i watched last night were during the dark ages of the ufc so im assuming pride wasnt magically getting on payperview here i also see sky sports in ads in every ring post at every event so im assuming that maybe fans in europe are getting it i was part of an mma site more than a decade ago and i had people i knew online who would share links and streams but a lot of the early events mostly early i had to watch after they had happened but sometimes i could catch a stream way late at night live it was a lot harder to find things like that back then you couldnt just type in vipbox or anyone of a dozen sites in google and see every sporting event live for free like you can now is bas rutten and maurelo actually calling these early events or is this something the ufc paid them to announce later my basic googling noted that bas was in the ufc during some of these events so idk how he could have announced them live i honestly dont know sometimes i would only get to hear japanese commentary and sometimes it would be bas and maury is the minute round minute rounds going to be the rules for the rest of pride i went from watching gracie vs sakuraba for hours to time limits within a year or two after that and wasnt sure if it was going to change again yes is standard but there are special rules fights as well that follow different rules like the wandycrocop fight
MMA,removed,youve crushed a ton of fan boys with the truth the truth hurts
MMA,removed,fuck yourself for posting the same shit as everyone else i hope everyone downvotes these posts
MMA,removed,lol yeah no if he fights diaz at it wont be for the belt and it is that would not be a real defense come on guys lol
MMA,removed,he blocked me for suggesting that the fighters conor beat are better than the ones dj have beat
MMA,removed,chaels podcast minutes in but i dont know if it was after i got hit that i kinda went into fight or flight mode or whatever you want to call it but i got hit and it was like i went right and i boxed
MMA,removed,oh fuck off for douche attempt yes the constant hate is relevant when hes gone in a row
MMA,removed,no possibility youre making assumptions and as the old saying goes making an ass out of yourself
MMA,removed,of course its a real title defence youre literally making no sense whatsoever nate still poses a very real threat to conor so i dont see how it wouldnt be a real title defence of course there are people more deserving but given how the ufc has been working lately who knows whats going to happen also youre clearly realising how moronic your argument is since youve gone back and deleted some of your comments in this thread
MMA,removed,youre clearly an idiot with no mma experience

MMA,removed,unfortunately you have it the wrong way around conor mcgregor is trying to fight dana white is trying to stop him the first time aldo had a pounded vagina the ufc had him checked and cleared by a doctor but he still wouldnt fight then he showed up and got bitch slapped out cold in seconds fight stopped after and then he started calling out mcgregor when he was signed to fight rda but then to his horror rda pulled out with a bruised clit but aldo after his any time any place post said he wasnt ready confirmed by dana white now aldo is dead silent because conor is available there isnt a peep out of him d

MMA,removed,some people love mma its their passion some people in this world arent motivated purely by watching petite asians getting enriched by bbcs some people pursue their passions whether they have a seperate reddit account or not how do you think we get fighters and porn
MMA,removed,i seem to have upset you im sorry you dont like hearing the truth but continuously crying about it and making an ass out of yourself replying to everything ive said wont change anything look at the majority of comments here look at how many people go out of their way to watch mighty mouse hes not on roids but he is ruling over a shallow division and his fights arent really compelling because of how much better he is than his competition and then come back and try to prove me wrong
MMA,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo

MMA,removed,the best thing about streams are the strange foreign commercials
MMA,removed,i didnt read the article but i saw the fights where the fighters used oxygen tanks prefight and that is what the user was implying
MMA,removed,when you fat little boys start training and have a little bit of evidence beyond your fanboy opinions you can accuse andrade of steroids until then shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,im not sure i agree i feel like not using anything that helps improve cardio state of mind etc when someone is in the midst of pro fight it could potentially mask brain injuries andor allow fighters to continue on when they shouldnt but maybe im wrong with that opinion
MMA,removed,that songs hard as fuck dana
MMA,removed,noooooooooooooo my stream died
MMA,removed,i will personally cum if punk comes out to either cult of personality but ill cum even harder if he comes out to this fire burns and ill cum if he walks at least once like vince

MMA,removed,laggy stream
MMA,removed,my stream is laggy as fuckkk

MMA,removed,me too damn reddit
MMA,removed,i think lesnar should be hired as a bouncer in case shit goes down
MMA,removed,what happened my stream froze then i saw werdum kick the coach
MMA,removed,my stream lagging behind base on these comments coming in
MMA,removed,lol at the stream that flipped over to babe nation for a sec

MMA,removed,mods ban this retard
MMA,removed,your a retard aswell as a cornerman when the fights over you dont go steaming into the fucking cage screaming shit at the opposing camps fighter hes lucky he only got a little kick
MMA,removed,wtf are you talking about he made his money in wwe he had the money without ever taking the fight his money has nothing to do with tonight
MMA,removed,im watching it on live streams and im cocked it was skipping and what i saw browne was on top fuck streams
MMA,removed,the stream changing to babestation is the highlight of the night
MMA,removed,why so retarded
MMA,removed,great argument dickhead
MMA,removed,it looked like it was bruce buffer
MMA,removed,i love all these posts popping up ive seen three so far haha then they get deleted rip
MMA,removed,i would look at gyms in your area and then go to each one dont assign yourself to one gym until you have gone there at least a few times to see if you mesh with the team
MMA,removed,im glad he did that that retard edmond cant go around screaming at ppl that can beat the fuck out of and expect no consequences i wish werdum head kicked that clown
MMA,removed,honestly im amazed everyone is praising him for that edmund is an asshole but you dont fucking kick someone for talking shit to you wholly unprofessional
MMA,removed,very nsfw
MMA,removed,hahaha it may not have been with the video it just looked like it was
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,yea its rmma its full of beta retardsi got downvoted to fuck and trolled by white knights for saying the fight was butterface vs butter face
MMA,removed,well theyre chanting cleveland now im gonna stop watching

MMA,removed,bro im sorry youre a mma savant why would i ever question you i mean calling cm punk the underdog fuck man are you mike jackson
MMA,removed,good god you are a douchebag
MMA,removed,there are more fakewrestling fans that follow mma than there are combat sport fans the fakewrestling fans have a small amount that just cannot see past the gimmick so believe their hero is superman tldr retards
MMA,removed,like edmund has a chance against werdum lol werdum would creampie his ass repeatedly and all edmund would be able to do is say good job champ with his ass in the air
MMA,removed,i am a bot providing a warning this comment contains the words tree fiddy if it is a story you have been warned proceed with caution message me to remove this comment or add a new copypasta
MMA,removed,go back to squared circle nerd
MMA,removed,doubt shell fuck him tonightgetting your ass beat that bad by a year old has to be kind of a turn off for her she might dwiddle her clit in the shower to mickey thoughso there is that
MMA,removed,great you actually are an asshole and proud of it no point of entertaining a troll if all youre gonna do is be rude i think an outsider looking at our conversation is more likely to have a negative opinion of mma fans than pro wrestling fans based on the way you acted which is the opposite of your intention have a nice day and i hope you dont remain so bitter throughout your life
MMA,removed,who gives a fuck no matter what he said he attacked a bystander in the cage thats completely unacceptable are you or just some white trashghetto piece of shit who wasnt raised right lol
MMA,removed,youre a douchebag
MMA,removed,im not gonna read all that man im just not
MMA,removed,maybe punk is insto cuckoldry and thats why he lost so quickly
MMA,removed,mickey is galls deep in aj while punk cries in a corner jerking off right now
MMA,removed,dog please dont even voice your opinion here if your gonna say stupid shit lol
MMA,removed,punk got cucked tonight
MMA,removed,if you think correia is a valid mma title challenger and not an accountant who took up mma years ago to lose weight and got to headline a card because she is brazilian and fights in the thinnest division in the sport im sorry you have a serious case of the retards also correia tagged rousey in their fight a few times which is just sad considering rousey trains at a boxing gym
MMA,removed,i was sports entertained tonight
MMA,removed,ignorantjackoffnoob httpsenwikipediaorgwikirousimarpalhares
MMA,removed,man fuck off with that bullshit
MMA,removed,just because its full doesnt mean shit lol the crowd was fucking ass go into all the other threads on the front page and youll see people complaining about it just because you sold seats doesnt mean the seats arent full of assholes
MMA,removed,was that ever up for debate did anyone ever actually make that point or are you just a jackass
MMA,removed,wont be the last time a brown disappoints in cleveland
MMA,removed,what determines how hard you should have theoretically laughed
MMA,removed,remember this mother fucker wants to fuck your wife and i cant make out the rest

MMA,removed,man and you arent the biggest asshole in this thread surprisingly
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off his joke then you peice of shit u think he needs a stupid fuckwitt like u telling him about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,i believe he was implying that youre probably an idiot
MMA,removed,now fuck i wanna see your moms naked vagina covered in my bloody day old semen
MMA,removed,what sort of pussy creates a throwaway account because they are scared of down votes
MMA,removed,take a hint dumbbell
MMA,removed,pussification generation
MMA,removed,i bet you are a mouth breathing troglodyte
MMA,removed,then stop watching and fuck off
MMA,removed,which is why i made my reply sigh fuck you all
MMA,removed,what edmond moved towards him while screaming incredibly insulting things in werdums third language with a facial expression that signaled intent to fight and if you dont believe me dont get it twisted if werdum wanted to fuck him up he would have he didnt he threw a teep at and backed off your moral high horse here is astounding
MMA,removed,gall is in a higher weight class and has tremendous jew jitz i think he would sub sage sadly sage does not have a great ground game or tdd
MMA,removed,weve been doing it for years lol now its a big deal give me a break even the winners have brain trauma they get hit plenty and some get knocked fucking silly before coming back to win pussy generation
MMA,removed,weakest beta on reddit chiming in right here
MMA,removed,agreed
MMA,removed,the chode
MMA,removed,fuck your wife and what
MMA,removed,youre deciding its a kick going by your emotions and not by objective reality its a push kick in retaliation for edmond getting up in his face since this is emotional to you and i considering im still replying i suspect our debate probably mirrors that of edmond and werdum its clear in the real youre not a werdum who goes around being badass mocking the haters instead youre probably more the yappy little edmond who goes around ordering people on their social etiquette how they should think what is acceptable etc you resonated with edmond because youre on the side of pathetic and need fines laws and governance to control the badasses in the world do everyone a favour dont have kids
MMA,removed,look at your desperate weak ass reply lol
MMA,removed,you think i give a fuck about being downvoted the people on this sub are insanely biased their fandom blinds them from rational thought its like telling a teenage girl that justin beiber is not the best singer in the world its a step below insanity because anyone with eyes can see from the video i posted how sloppy and bad his boxing is its funny because everyone shits on michael bisping but bispings boxing is worlds better than werdums
MMA,removed,he had plenty of business being there hes accomplishing his dream youre just being an asshole
MMA,removed,good fuck him
MMA,removed,the fabled athleticism of a wwe actor this is a pretty stupid statement novak djokovic is a phenomenal athlete in fact hes probably a better athlete than anyone in the ufc but anyone in the ufc would still beat the living shit out of him in a fight an athlete who isnt a professional fighter and a couple of years training at the age of does not make punk a professional fighter being beaten in a professional fight by a guy who actually is a professional fighter isnt a big surprise so sit down and shut the fuck up with that wwe actor nonsense
MMA,removed,fuck clevland fuck edmound fuck you
MMA,removed,is this not an internet board you sound like a cunt to me
MMA,removed,still not seeing it sorry everyone looked gay in the thats just how the fashion looks now he takes down minor youtube accounts that call him out for being stupid says some guy k also hes like and
MMA,removed,he makes crybaby hands to the crowd
MMA,removed,somebody should get a performance bonus for kicking you in your whiny social justice warrior mouth
MMA,removed,yea what a crime not knowing about physics if i had to list important things a person should know i could legitimately probably get to the spot before i named rofl electromagnetism gtfo with this elitist nonsense
MMA,removed,no fucktard thats the reebok pay nothing to do with his purse which was probably to show and to win if standard contracts apply

MMA,removed,its not supposed to just saying if you want to compare me at least find someone relevant mr i cant tell if its a guy or girl
MMA,removed,gtfo you stupid needle dick steroid user

MMA,removed,if you live in glendale the average armenian is like edmund for sure its weird in that city

MMA,removed,lol shut the fuck up plenty of brazilians have wins post usada shit we just had a card that was predominatly brazilians getting the w need i remind you rda is still a champ post usada or does he not count given he lives in america and we all know that its impossible to source peds outside of brazil
MMA,removed,bisping spends his entire time talking to his older son hes such a classic english sports dad also i was thinking when he was saying the good looking stuff how devastating would it be if he walked in on his wife flogging the box off herself to an interview of luke rockhold that would be marriage ending stuff and then after the fight she keeps trying to hang out with him but rockhold tells her to fuck off and bisping has to console her that she didnt get to bang him what a nightmare
MMA,removed,firstrowsports
MMA,removed,giving you independence well except northern ireland we kept that shit doesnt mean youre not still our bitchesyou get directed to the uk site because despite having mcgregor as a country youre really that important on an international level
MMA,removed,uglyfuckingcunts com just pictures of ugly women
MMA,removed,wow youre really stupid the ufc showwin minimum is you should probably learn to shut the fuck up if you dont know what youre talking about you guys ever notice the little whiners that cry about fighter pay like ustardawgog always lie about numbers
MMA,removed,he would probably go home and jack off thinking about it
MMA,removed,the fight pass library player always has that bug of skipping a few seconds every minute or and playing back few seconds earlier it still skips there again its hard to buy your product if i couldnt watch a fight fully in every video so i dont buy fightpass and just fucking stream
MMA,removed,something like twitch for combat sports maybe uh its called television stupid
MMA,removed,her striking maybe ugly but its effective with seems pretty effective but thats not even what you were taking about you called her a paper champion as if destroying all the top women in her division somehow doesnt matter because she doesnt have good boxing technique youre a moron
MMA,removed,better than a second mortgage because you a got a boo boo also most of you cunts dont make of what we do so you actually have nothing to brag about lol

MMA,removed,who do you think you dealing with ccksucker
MMA,removed,pedo glasses fuck off
MMA,removed,exactly you ask me about a totally different scenario and use it to justify this one i dont think you understand what the rules are a takedown and knockdown are not the same thing plus when does conor do your equivalent of laying on him in the second round you sound like what i imagine a conor hugger would if diaz would have won by decision
MMA,removed,k so youre a racist
MMA,removed,she can sit on my face any day
MMA,removed,no shit they affect the brain because people have thin fucking skins youre telling me that cornermans words are gonna revive the brutality against asians again im a pathetic whitewashed asian scum so cute of you to attack me so directly getting heated in the moment already with some stranger across the internet like that cornerman you just overgeneralized me then proceeded to imply all whitewashed asians are scum and have thay hurrlaughagmeforrespect mentality you stereotyped something like a racist or sexist or homophobe does time to stereotype back for fair game you year old overly liberalcollege sociologist major sheep of a prick but it isnt nothing either which is a point i stressed a thousand times but more likely than not you skimmed through my posts looking for things to get offended by the art of argument is lost where the goal is to try to understand first then readjust if necessary rather than be a selfserving douchebag and find something to be right about words are more important than broken bones if they lead to broken bones that cornermans words did not lead to unnecessary physical pain just people like you getting your manchild panties in a bunch my opinion was that its bad but not that bad that isnt an argument thats objectively refutable judging the severity of something is subjective and can only be falsely seen as objective if one is terribly closeminded and condescending something you are ill refrain from responding if you even do respond since most people like you like to say what you wanna say then close your ears and skip off to give yourself a false sense of victory if your response is as pathetic as your first one racist
MMA,removed,aldo is such a little shit yeah the greatest featherweight of all time and one of the greatest fighters ever once undefeated for ten years is a little shit this sub sometimes
MMA,removed,pretty sure i heard how bout u go an fuck off my decision then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here

MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,keep tipping your fedora and hoping girls will start liking nice guys mr neckbeard
MMA,removed,i dont know why ppl upvote you so much but i have a comment with same idea and ppl down voted me into oblivion
MMA,removed,with that statement you can start blaming rape victims for being raped
MMA,removed,oh fuck off you twat everyone knows that and calls the thing frankenstein to avoid going into detail on the thing every time
MMA,removed,that was one of the best technical fights in the history of the ufc gtfo
MMA,removed,leave it to le reddituers to take a funny pic and make it misogynistic

MMA,removed,notice their two different fighting styles on pads you underdstand that mitt work is to hone in your combinations right and not a power exercise again where is the fight of rooney and tyson fighting drop the troll please lol
MMA,removed,buying pay per views does nothing for fighter pay either when the ufc brass see that ppv number they dont think wow look at all the support for our fighters all they care about is the money going into their pocket i watch streams for the same reason i buy the merch the fighters sell themselves and not rebok crap i wont buy something from a company whos business practices i disagree with the ufc pay fighters a fraction of what they make in my eyes the majority of money should go to the fighters not the guys in suits and yea i might be reacting strongly to this one situation but its more the whole fighter pay situation that makes me angry this is just a drop in a bloody bucket
MMA,removed,are you fucking kidding you think a multy billion dollar company is hurting for cash you think they cant afford to pay their fighters millions more right now at this exact moment its people like you who shill out money to ufc no matter what that lets the ufc get away with paying their fighters nothing the casual fans on this sub are cancer

MMA,removed,is that her clit pointing out lol
MMA,removed,you sir are an idiot
MMA,removed,fuck off
MMA,removed,she shouldnt not against an undefeated challenger or ronda both have a higher claim
MMA,removed,while this sub has a huge problem with random downvotes that guy didnt actually make sense
MMA,removed,i dont understand why hes letting conor affect his career so much he needs to get on with it especially since theres no guarantee hes getting the fight
MMA,removed,no room for filler in rmma get out of here and go back to scandinavia where you came you dirty weege
MMA,removed,they dont go over for that long
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,old enough to know that not even being able to win a belt in a second rate promotion doesnt qualify anyone as great and being a washed up way for the ufc to pull in the military crowd doesnt either he was good never great calling guys like tim kennedy great diminishes the accomplishments of the truly great

MMA,removed,omg stfu about esther lin already
MMA,removed,noob cunt
MMA,removed,in a boxing context httpwwwdictionarycombrowseiced httpwwwdictionarycombrowseschooled per the dictionary definition youd never use these phrases for boxing but you do and we both know exactly what they mean or at least i hope you do you are being purposely obtuse and the fact you are claiming charles martin is an elite level boxer makes you an idiot of the highest order winning one of the top belts in boxing unfortunately doesnt necessarily mean you are the best or even top of your division the rankings can be manipulated easily and promoters hold a huge amount of sway with different sanctioning bodies meaning their fighter often gets undeserved title shots often these titles are for vacant belts using charles martin as the example was he or glaskov in any independant top for rankings saul canelos last opponent liam smith who had he fought in the top at lmw to be considered a world champion
MMA,removed,soz mate am an aussie and cunt is just normal here just take it on the chin

MMA,removed,no one would see my shit anyway because its nested to your shit which is collapsed because your original comments were hammered with downvotes even if they werent were in so deep into this bs conversation that it would probably already be collapsed under continue thread which no one ever clicks btw unless it has something to do with them personally do you even reddit bro no one gives two shits about your or my shitfest trust me but you can tell yourself whatever you want thatll make you feel good about yourself im not the one who cares enough to keep fighting until someone tells me im right uominouswhateverfuckingshit is right dammit tim kennedys balls taste fucking delicious he aint done anything wrong yall
MMA,removed,yeah its from the podcast
MMA,removed,they both cheated plain and simple both guys were in the wrong in that particular fight yoel could have had the result overturned arguing that kennedy got the finish with the help of an illegal tactic not saying stalling is cool but neither is glovegrabbing that shits against the rules cmon man all of those statements are from you your comments repeatedly downplay the extent of romeros and his teams transgressions which implies they were of equal importance and effect to an arguable nonfoul by kennedy im not trying to twist anything look at larger image look at how romero tosses his arms back and forth even when kennedy doesnt have a hand on his right arm can you really look at that and say kennedys splitsecond hold had any influence over the direction of the end of that round or that it had more impact than his wrist hold immediately prior to that there are hundreds of cage grabs and glove grabs that have affected a fight more than this splitsecond glove hold and they arent called fouls so what makes this one so important to call out as hey guys dont ignore that kennedy did this hes a cheat and fine maybe you think it really is that important so if you do think minorinconsequential glove holds are important to call out then can you explain to me what is different between a glove hold and a wrist hold why is one illegal and the other not and do you really consider this instance to be on the same level as the things romero has pulled

MMA,removed,do you retards actually fact check the shit you spew aldo fought twice every year except and when injuries kept him to fighting only once those years defenses a year is pretty average for champs so this aldo so inactive heuheuheu spam that you mcgregor retards spam makes no sense
MMA,removed,you are really really dumb you are just spewing mcgregors own talking points aldo has fought at the very least once a year to twice a year since winning the feather weight title in aldo has pulled out of more cards than other champions because he has been the champ for longer than everybody else

MMA,removed,no one cares dude lol why do you think anyone cares
MMA,removed,after ufc they got the taste of money and it has gone downhill since ufc greed is destroying the sport i wont go to deep into this but you all know now the frutatta bros never cared about mma since they ended up selling it to the fucking chinese of all people but politics aside look at their greed regarding ronda and conor and what it is doing to our sport wmma is a spectacle and a joke lets face it it was popular when the female royce gracie was fed cans the best woman in the sport cyborg was humiliated and shunned by the ufc especially from the president dana white now you have jose aldo one of the best if not tops saying he wants to go to other sports and you can tell he is disgusted with the ufc look at fucking conor mcgregor vs alvarez absolutely fucking disgusting look what they did to fn khabib i cant believe this fucking weasel conor and the favoritism he gets he isnt even witty and his trash talk is more hateful than it is funny witty and clever conor is an angry adolescent the ufc has gone way too far they were fans like us at one point and they use to have love for the sport it died sometime after they got a taste of the mainstream after ufc honestly pre ufc between ufc to were the greatest days of the ufc i am absolutely disgusted with the ufc i actually find myself not enojying mma because of all the negative media like twitter fights and drama and all the manufactured drama they are trying to cater to adolescents and it is absolutely insane i dont get it anyways long time mma fan here long time bjj guy too and i am starting to hate watching mma will always love martial arts but this sport is pure trash anyways guys no one is telling you to stop watching ufc but you really shouldnt pay for it somewhere in the world it is on free tv and the internet will show it to you for freeï»¿
MMA,removed,no it doesnt i didnt even say everyone do i really need to spell it out for you that im talking about mcgregor fans and not mma fans as a whole youre just being a salty pedantic ass hat because you know its true
MMA,removed,thats a stretch mate have you not been watching any ufc events for the past i dont know year crazy shit like people getting caught has been happening in almost every ppv it seems now im sure no one thought bisping would knockout rockhold but look now but but he got lucky yeah well jeremy can get lucky too and seeming as proportion wise jeremy hits harder than michael its possible he could catch conor conor beats jeremy times out of but im just saying its not impossible just an uneducated bandwagon fan type of thing to say it wouldnt against conor you sound like one of those conor nuthuggers on youtube youre a youtube comment never go youtube comment
MMA,removed,because rmma are fucking idiots who crack jokes on people getting injured dude is stfu
MMA,removed,he doesnt make any money off clicks or try to get more popular because of it you tool
MMA,removed,i feel so threatened by some dork on the internet i dont how im going to recover from all of the downvotes i get
MMA,removed,its not about the money really jose youve moaned more about money during your time with the ufc than anyone
MMA,removed,just stop you can try to dress a low brow conversation all you want but its still low brow by nature of its topic for instance an interviewer can try to find the classiest way to bring up a celebritys sex life but thats not going to make it anything but a trashy audience pandering question would you prefer that woodleys position solely be judged off of onesentence excerpts being reposted on twitter ideally no one would give woodley any attention for his dumb racebaiting comments and ariels not asking these questions to give him a chance to explain himself hes asking these questions knowing the answer will be more controversial and that it will bring in more viewers
MMA,removed,why is anyone talking about race relations these days called racebaiting the people who complain about this are largely racist and they dont want to discuss race relations because they dont want to be called a racist its a because if the discussion comes up and such a person shares their true views on race instead of being pc or whatever excuse they have for being decent people theyre going to be called a racist
MMA,removed,your mocking a guy for saying a meme and your flairs a meme you twat and how am i coming to conors defense here im pointing out youre a hypocrite
MMA,removed,from their ipo filing alliance mma inc was formed to acquire the businesses of the target companies and the media libraries of two prominent mixed martial arts or mma promotions by combining the target companies alliance intends to create a developmental league for professional mma fighters and a feeder
MMA,removed,mcgregor ended his whole career lmao typical brazilian crybaby shit go spill some pee and deport drugtesters and suck as a bellator fighter
MMA,removed,okay so lets do some math teachers work about hours a week maybe or so hours for grading so round it out to about hrs a week for months so x about hrs a year so fighters generally fight about twice a year but ill be nice and say times a year they do month camps plus the fight week the media obligations youre talking about are for higher end fighters were talking about bottom of the barrel lowest paid guys in the ufc so fight camps plus fight weeks thats about months weeks or weeks so in order for them to equal how much teachers work they would have to be putting in hr work weeks during camp and fight week you think fighters put in hr weeks if you do then this conversation is over because youre clearly an idiot
MMA,removed,conor is getting his hand held and gently walked into holding belts you realize he has to fight for them right they arent actually handed to him he cleared out fw after embarrassing the alltime fw champ he was set to very quickly take a shot at lw that got derailed due to rda getting hurt and now the train is just back on the track he isnt held to the same standards as anyone else in the ufc and it makes the entire organization look bad no one is held to the same standard as anyone else one guy pushes a ref and gets cut without dana even watching tape roy pushkicks a ref and we hear nothing even now holloway runs through fw after his only loss being to mcgregor and he cant even get a sniff at a contender shot its not like the fucking game has been flowing fairly and objectively along and mean ole mac ruined things it would serve the ufc right to have a lot of their top fighters drop them and go to bellator because bellators system makes more sense hahaha fuck off
MMA,removed,who the fuck is that guy
MMA,removed,maybe something in the water
MMA,removed,you are a moron
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up and stop being dramatic he has a cushy endorsement deal from reebok and is making a few hundred k per fight hes not getting fucked over and as soon as they throw more money at him hell stop complaining

MMA,removed,youre a fucking idiot
MMA,removed,you have the intellectual maturity of a logical fallacies really dont apply when were talking about something thats completely contrived and arbitrary like sports im done wasting my time with this youre in the vast vast vast minority that fails to recognize why aldo very obviously deserves a rematch
MMA,removed,irish bastard connor mcgregor ah so youre a racist cunt i see do us all a favor and fuck off
MMA,removed,you can go fuck yourself no matter what raceculture you are
MMA,removed,improve your reading comprehension and actually respond to arguments and then youll have a better time next time
MMA,removed,not from you your posts arent that lifechanging
MMA,removed,mcgregor is queue jumping there is no way he deserves a lw title shot after a win and a loss against the divisions gate keeper rda is much more deserving of a title fight but now he has to wait for the versace leprechaun shit show
MMA,removed,aldo has been treated like shit should we be surprised no the ufc is actually greedy pig enterprises incognito the way the fighters are treated is very poor the rankings mean nothing to the ufc and this is really bad for the fighters because what else do they have to aim for other than fighting the guy ranked above them dominant champs should always get a rematch not just the popular champs very few champions had cleaned their division out so thoroughly as aldo anderson is one that comes to mind and he was granted an immediate rematch i look forward to when other promotions come to the fore front and treat their fighters in a legitimate and sensible way i wish i could say i wont support the ufc anymore but i love the sport too much maybe i will just use illegal streams from now on i have already sworn off live events due to a shit experience

MMA,removed,he is charismatic but his shit talking isnt anything special a lmao what is there nothing about mcgregor people wont discredit theres literally maybe a handful in fighters in the ufc better at trash talking than conor mcgregor he went a bit over the top during his buildupel chapo phase but when you look over his whole career and he has delivered some gems and absolutely dominated guys mentally if his trash talk wasnt anything special he wouldnt be where he is now

MMA,removed,tldr type in Â¯ãÂ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the Â¯ãÂ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out Â¯ãÂ¯ which will turn out like this Â¯ãÂ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ã the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ã so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written Â¯ãÂ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
MMA,removed,i got into mma sometime in i too felt like it was hard to get a sense of who everyone was so what i did was pirate all the previous ufc and pride events and watch them in order i also did this with all the tuf seasons i rewatched the whole history of the ufc times and saw the greats come and go the rules change and the sport evolve i dont have the files anymore but i wish i did and i couldnt tell you where to find themif its still possible it prob is but difficult if you have moral objections to pirating id say watch the embedded ufc youtube vids or get fightpass or watch this season of tuf to get a better feel for the fighters as people

MMA,removed,i distinctly remember conor fans wouldnt shut the fuck up about how dangerous aldo was in sparring
MMA,removed,if chad had a full camp and gassed i would believe conor did that with kicks but we didnt have a full camp chad to measure these things what we know for sure is that he came in out of shape which is obvious and we can prove it you like your story cause it makes conor look better but he fought a man out of shape
MMA,removed,could also use the signature emmanuel yarborough technique the tit choke
MMA,removed,actually demian maia is the hardest person to hit absorbing all of strikes in his last like fights how do you know his cardio will be worse at a higher weight lots of fighters have better cardio at a higher weight due to not cutting as much umm what that only works when fighters arent on the edge of death like rumble but fighters who can relatively easily make weight will definitely have worse cardio at higher weights conor at vs is a great example of that gonna have to land it against the hardest to hit person in mma really surprised youre able to breathe with cruzs nuts so far down your throat just because hes hard to hit doesnt mean he wont get hit point is with some fighters you need to absorb a ton of damage to go down like the diaz bros and others are onehitterquitters like hendo cormier etc
MMA,removed,someone post her office number again

MMA,removed,wow hes so politically incorrect what a madman this chop buster is
MMA,removed,hey guys this was me and my father in law we were absolutely stunned speechless we tried to get tickets at the box office but they were sold out we spoke to people selling but they wanted nearly double the price so instead i came up with the idea of finding out where he was staying i went to the raddisson blu and met all the fighters on the card had pics with them all but not with bisping who i went there for i over heard a camera guy say something about the lowry hotel i googled it and it turns out its where he stays whenever a fight is there so because it was last minute the room was only Â£ which we went halves on so we could atleast sleep for the friday night now most of our money was gone we had booked a room at a hotel i wasnt even sure he was at lol anyway get to the hotel and check in hang about the lobby for a few hours from midnight til about am realised he wasnt coming so i went to pay for our bar bill as i handed the money to the guy i heard bisping i threw my money at him and darted to the lobby and saw him get in a lift i was gutted so i was now determined as i knew he was there my fatherinlaw fucked off to bed but i stayed in that damn lobby all night he never came down about in the afternoon the next day i saw bispings coach and approached him i was real polite and he expected me to ask for tickets but i didnt all i cared about was meeting and getting a pic with bisping i told him i didnt want tickets all i asked was if he could arrange a pic he said he was sleeping at the moment and he wouldnt be leaving for the arena until i said il be standing in the lobby all day and i wont be moving just incase he comes down before his coach came back down and asked if were were still interested in tickets as he knew a guy selling some for the actual price we both said yes and he went away again few hours later he came back telling us he was arranging a meeting with the guy so we could buy the tickets off him he then sat with us and we spoke about mma and joked about stuff he said i knew my stuff and that he will be back soon with the guy for the tickets he drove off in his flashy car and we expected him to come back with the guy but when he came back he was on his own he walked in and didnt even acknowledge us it was wierd we thought we had annoyed him or something another few hours pass and he comes out the liftand walks to the counter on his phone he hung up the phone and just said come on then and walked off we didnt even have a clue what to do he then told us to get in the lift took us direct to his hotel room did a secret knock and we followed him in bisping wasnt there at first i think they made out he wasnt there for shock reaction it fucking worked he gave us the tickets and i was sat next to bispings brother all night who gets very upset and worked up when his brother fights so i was consoling him most of the fight while we watched it together we were so speechless and stunned we really did not expect it the strangest part is his hotel room was rooms down from ours and we didnt even know i could have sat outside my room and eventually have seen him the rooms are very close together what are the odds of that

MMA,removed,first of all what is nate going to pay conor back for the first round second its diaz v mcgregor diaz gets top billing he made conor bitch out in the first fight this video sucks i would tell you put conors nuts back in your mouth but they never left
MMA,removed,glad im not the only one who thinks rda is on roids
MMA,removed,i always thought rda was on the juice glad there was a fighter who agreed
MMA,removed,if he beats edgar hell be a weird champion beater floating in between the weight classes of those two champs barao and edgar that is
MMA,removed,as long as holloway gets his shot thats all i really care about id personally rather see holloway vs mcgregor though if for no other reason than holloway is the only fighter that mcgregor couldnt finish yes i know conor blew out his knee that fight intrigues me but i cant help but think was conor unable to ko him bc he injured his knee or was it bc he wasnt towering over holloway like he usually does over opponents at fw but ill take aldoholloway thatd be a good one too
MMA,removed,interesting to see so many people say ww i agree theyre killers dont freak out but i think very few people would consider too many ww in rankings before the loss i would of given robbie a or spot but no one elseif the division is so full of killers why no love surely being top of the strongest division warrants more respect in pound for pound from myself included im not talking about ufc official ranking just general consensus as a side note where does everyone rank wonderboy
MMA,removed,i have fight pass and buy every ppv but i pirate the prelim streams for every event because i have to and theres no way for me to get those fights legally here i just dont act like im doing it because im some vanguard of morality that cares about fighter pay

MMA,removed,best of luck with your situation mate but i just want to say there are some very nice quality streams out there these days i know you want to go the legal route but the fact of the matter is that theyre making it unnecessarily hard for you to give them your money
MMA,removed,also it will benefit the hordes of unchecked migrants spilling into eu countries haha woops
MMA,removed,i think the big thing with frankie was that his wrestling was good enough that he wouldnt get man handled by the bigger guys but he really wasnt throwing them around either its a good fight for stephens but edgars boxing is real tight and he might just get picked apart ive been a fan of jeremys a long time though you can never count him out
MMA,removed,i feel like a lot of this is stuff he wouldnt want you to go and tell everyone about on social media you pretty much just gave a chunk of his strategy for fighting frankie away threw it out there that he accused rda of being on roids and announced his next fight for him
MMA,removed,hick
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off this page you peice of shit u think eddie or tyron need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling them about how to promote fights who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,couple of the most undeserving title shots in ufc history fuck off im sick of neckbeards complaining about how woodley and alvarez earnt their shots who gives a shit what matters is they both capitalized on their chances in impressive fashion theyre the champs now and its not like either of them got the shot coming off a loss

MMA,removed,hey cheer up it could be worse you could be the guy who has to put the produce back in the produce section before walmart closes
MMA,removed,im not a fan boy suuuuuuuuuure i think every champion should be pushed it makes sense business wise to create more stars where you can and mighty mouse has shown that even goattier champs have trouble being pushed if people dont like themcant warm to them no matter how much they get pushed i think youre just dickriding the rest of the sub to be honest claim not to be a fanboy and then throw out a statement like that because someone has a differing opinion top mind show me the plenty of fighters that have talked about it too ill wait youre pretty new to mma arent ya you must be if you think eddie is the only fighter ever to talk about being scarednervous and that somehow makes him unique and you didnt watch the interview i sent why would i no one is under any obligations to watch stuff fanboys demand and stuff fanboys squeee over youre just looking to argue because its you thats biased against eddie you use the word biased like its some sort of argumentwinning trump card why is that youre way more biased for eddie than i am against him so why are getting a free pass on the bias argument youre making as far as im concerned eddie is just a fairly dull guy whos trying way to hard to throw his weight around before he loses his belt yet youre throwing a tantrum because someone doesnt like your big boy crush you got issues
MMA,removed,i dont know why no one has mentioned this id recommend going to the ufc or wikipedia pages for all you favourite fightersor popular fighters atm whatever looking at their mma record and googling each fight you will get results for almost all of them and you can watch them on websites that offer pirated videos then you will have watched most of the fights of most of the fighters
MMA,removed,im very glad you felt the need to clarify you are indeed a trump supporter now i can surely look down on you as dirt in my eyes

MMA,removed,gtfo of here lol
MMA,removed,if he doesnt pay and gets suspended in nevada there is all of chance hes going to continue competing in mma because the ufc isnt about to stake its license on conor mcgregor its sad how you guys downvoted the guy in this very comment chain trying to explain just that and the idiot replying hahahahahhaha edit hahahaha is you can argue if its going to get reduced if he tries to fight it in court or if the ufc will ultimately just decide to pay it for him something theyve never done before but one way or another that fines getting paid this is reddit are you really surprised this place is a cesspool of stupidity and circle jerk

MMA,removed,i do know the fucking difference jackass you are one to talk about not admitting a hook involves full hiprotation and pivoting of the leadfoot and it comes from the side that punch came straight from the front just because eddies arm wasnt fully extended doesnt mean its a hook jackass also straight punches are guardsplitters they split the guard down the middle hooks come from the side go take a boxing class jackass

MMA,removed,i didnt name any specific people theres corrupt activity in the acs just like the government you probably should take the stick out of your ass and stop trying to belittle my argument just because you think you know everything just because the ac controls everything doesnt mean its gonna continue down that path or that they are correct in the measures they take
MMA,removed,why would he he subbed him like a bitch in a round and a half the supposed come back fight to make it all better was a five round squeaker
MMA,removed,survives the second one oh fuck off your boy got dropped on his arse times
MMA,removed,whoa bro youre just an elitist gate keeping asshole
MMA,removed,more like you dont like mcgregor so you have to make an ignorant statement so you can give me shit for calling out someone for throwing shit at people who did nothing wrong i like nate diaz and am a fan i cant stand his hypocritical fans this is such a stupid fucking comment should i start rooting for only white people as well i mean i am white maybe i should stop cheering for dj do i have to like every american simply because theyre from my country these motherfuckers arent fighting for me they dont give a fuck about me half the americans dont even bring the flag out when they fight

MMA,removed,no it says conoh bressuu ð·ð·ð·
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,the reason she was so happy was because its akin to seeing someone win the lottery she knew she was the luckiest person on the planet to fight and beat the reigning champ all while having her clit pumped up on roids and ronda falling right into her poorly laid trap luck doesnt begin to describe it so she has such an emotional reaction and take note how that was her peak and she has looked like shit since she was a lucky scrub in the right place at the right time purposefully holding back in her initial fights so she would get underestimated lol i guess she reverted back to holding back because she fights like shit and is boring as hell
MMA,removed,he calls conor mcgregor mcnuggets i think that is just fucking hilarious plus the dude is a badass fighter im a fan this sub fucking hates him though i think its hilarious god i hope he wins the butthurt will be palpable
MMA,removed,ok guys dont down vote immediately john koppenhaver vs jared rollins hear me out i know war machine is a god damn piece of shit but well before he was a know woman beater he had a scrap vs jared rollins that was a slug fest both guys put it on the line and at the very end warmachine managed to get the choke i fucking hate how that piece of shit tarnished that fight for me because its one i used to watch regularly
MMA,removed,the people that cant afford ppv just stream it on sketchy adinfested websites hell the people that can afford ppv probably just stream it on sketchy adinfested websites

MMA,removed,shit up idiot u dont know shit wats the point if testing wen there isnt really any harsh penalties years ban is bullshit if the guy cheating had killed his oponent would u still think years was a good enough penalty your a moron shut your mouth dummy they should lose all the money be banned for life and go criminal court
MMA,removed,in every major american city you cannot leave a bike or anything out even locked especially a bike without it getting snatched all because of the cuddly addicts constantly stealing to get their next fix who we shouldnt judge or spew hate towards the people i know that have had done heroin i believe snuffed itbut i never talked to them about it exactly and they are just acquaintances that i now never see and i will keep it that way because i dont want to get closer to opiate addicts the family they are stuck with can shoulder that burden their families hadhave handfuls with them and they were not injecting addicts i wouldnt want an opiate addict to me my doctor my lawyer my accountant but this is reddit the perfect venue to fight for nonsense notions like one activity is just as good as any other and being a drug addict is no different from being a nonaddict i also wouldnt want them being my roommate my girlfriend etc
MMA,removed,really seems like the reporters are just sucking woodleys dick hes an idiot haahhahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahaha
MMA,removed,she took so many steroids she has erectile disfunction on her monster clit
MMA,removed,if this guy is even telling the truthwhich is in doubt that would seriously suck for the people in the facility with him the op has used a reddit sub ropiaterollcall to apparently sell dope to other redditors via pm see my post here maybe if he is telling the truth he is dumb enough to reveal his rehab facility so we can warn them beforehand the people i know do drugs by relying on knowing a local dealer that is one of the benefits of rehab it takes out of your local environment but if someone knows a subreddit like that they can arrange to find dealers anywhere it is not likely in the smartphone age that rehab facilities can keep everyone offline either if you work on such facilities you need to be very careful about internet access it seems
MMA,removed,exactly what i was thinking the whole thing seemed so weird to me lol some people are so gullible
MMA,removed,when you are on drugs you stupid things why not give him the benefit of the doubt that he wants to clean his life up take your negative crap out of here
MMA,removed,a drug addict selling drugs god no how can this be
MMA,removed,the way what was worded i started talking to you to correct your ignorant knowledge of acl tears comparing the level of sport instead of the grade of the tear to determine how severe the injury is and youve been downvoting me ever since
MMA,removed,i really cant wait to see the shitstorm here when conor beats aldo again the aldo nuthuhggers have surpassed the conor nuthuggers at this point after months of saying they were sure aldo was going to end the hypetrain and embarrass conor he got knocked out cold in a single punch they disappeared until nate beat conor but now theyre back in full force it was just a lucky punch they said conor was just in his head they said aldo was just nervous they said
MMA,removed,shit up idiot u dont know shit wats the point if testing wen there isnt really any harsh penalties years ban is bullshit if the guy cheating had killed his oponent would u still think years was a good enough penalty your a moron shut your mouth dummy they should lose all the money be banned for life and go criminal court
MMA,removed,fuck off

MMA,removed,your statement is ironic because youve been busy hanging onto conors nuts this whole time
MMA,removed,hey dickhead who are you looks like our town isnt as small as we thought it was someone should really twitter for me i dont think ppl remember tony his mma shit had to have been after highschool cuz yea good not the best in almost everything wtf
MMA,removed,i think a format where you go over the co main and featured bout would be better but your analysis is spot on and amazing as it always has been
MMA,removed,because we all know how obscure mma is
MMA,removed,c brazilians make sure to only roid in their own country with corrupt athletic commissions

MMA,removed,if this was about my comments you could have a point too bad its not so you dont have a point but you will get upvoted by the invisible mccracker stans anyway so all is good
MMA,removed,why would you not be educated on something youre paying a lot of money to see thats reason they say stupid shit like i mentioned because of the time they dont have a fucking clue as to what is going on youre missing out on of a product essentially if you want to see people get koed just watch some boring arse one punch ko compilations on wshh
MMA,removed,they asked now that he lost if he would defend his belt dana and conor said that would be his next fight what the fuck is up with you delusional conor fans you dont even watch all the press and then try to comment about what he was saying either watch it and comment or dont comment about it at all
MMA,removed,jewjiff shoes

MMA,removed,id buy a rockholdpaige vsnzandt porn
MMA,removed,just because you can physically make that doesnt mean you could perform at that weight again bringing up irrelevant bullshit you said jones would have to cut off a leg to make i replied with if he does it by dehydrating then yes but if he loses weight it shouldnt be impossible whether or not he can perform well at that weight is irrelevant if you seriously think a human cannot be healthy at pounds then youre a complete idiot
MMA,removed,jon jones is not pounds i know hes not pounds im saying that if he lost weight he could cut and be healthy at hristian bale can make for the machinistdoesnt mean he can live or do anything at that weight the difference is that pounds for a foot man is never healthy pounds for a man is a healthy weight im not saying he has to make most guys at weigh lb jones can easily reach and be at healthy weight this is why your argument is dumb as fuck so theres your first point irrelevant like i said jon jones cuts to you pretty much caused an entire argument because you misread what i said i said if he cuts by dehydrating it would be impossible to make because he walks around but cut is also a term that is used as lose weight if he lost weight then dehydrated to it wouldnt be too bad thats what i literally said in my original comment for example pettis couldnt make and he walks around at like i said if he lost weight he could easily make it he tried to make purely based on dehydration your points have no basis in reality and your saying shit because your frustrated at how dumb your initial statement is now youre spewing random bullshit go and reread my original comment if you cannot understand it then you seriously do have some brain damage
MMA,removed,well you and your band of troglodyte joe haters can crawl back under the rock you came from

MMA,removed,lol when did i say that he didnt when you said maia would be a nightmare because of his grappling oriented fighting the implicature of which is that gsp wasnt a grappling oriented fighter gsp was primarily a striker early on and then he turned to a wrestler at least vs the strikers you werent talking about contenders you were talking about champs you dont get to backpedal and change the context just because it suits you since im guessing you didnt actually watch his fights you should check his jake shields fight and his koschek fight pure striking in both of them lol since you didnt even read my prior post i suggest you go back and try again because you look pretty stupid right now

MMA,removed,trump supporter wouldnt get it
MMA,removed,wonderboy talking about race is kinda a dumb move he has no idea what woodley has been through you cant deny marketable fighters good looking white guys like wonderboy and sage get some extra shine from the ufc wonderboy got a promotional tour in the philippines and shit
MMA,removed,feb at utc httpiimgurcombxvmothjpg ran into this legend and got to pick his mind about all kinds of stuff mightysquad httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,removed,im a simple man i see people talk about privilege i immediately downvote and stop listening
MMA,removed,honestly i think what bisping did was worse than hitler
MMA,removed,oh wow an invicta champ that wins on fox is totally all it takes to be another ronda rousey you sure know your stuff man you really broke this case wide open i dont claim to be making an astute observation which is why the top comment looks like a retard of course you have oneupped him so theres that
MMA,removed,yeah she was like premature and didnt make it very sad indeed
MMA,removed,a more emotional angle fuck off lol
MMA,removed,its hard not to be in the face of such soul crushing dumbassery i dont have the saintlike patience needed to respond to shit like ishihara is way more legit than kawajiri cub is a b c fighter and id bet the bank on artem to beat cub in a calm rational way i dont even think its possible
MMA,removed,cub swanson vs doo hoo choi
MMA,removed,pussy dont laugh and pretend to be above it
MMA,removed,checks out favorite tv show as a kid dragon ball z
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,theres no one else but whites in the ufc right
MMA,removed,hopefully she does a xxx movie
MMA,removed,thats up to you guys im going to point out the hypocrisy every time i see it it has gotten slightly better but it was really out in the open when jon jones first beat shogun
MMA,removed,idgaf if this attention whore is bullshitting about going into mma his shtick is awful and youre rewarding it
MMA,removed,oh wow white people dont notice racism or their own privilege must be that everybody else is just imagining it
MMA,removed,silverback gorilla we cool
MMA,removed,what racism that doesnt happen anymore white people
MMA,removed,really not dominated by white conservative males
MMA,removed,are you white
MMA,removed,mostly liberal think like that and you will get downvoted to hell because liberals rules reddit
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,utridentmixed surprisingly silent when this type of stuff come up
MMA,removed,my point is that the only way to get over racism is by well getting over it youre fucking kidding me
MMA,removed,as the rules eddies rigjt as a fan schuab is
MMA,removed,why the fuck do most people want this cuban cunt to win the championship he is a fucking cheat that has been proven several times i know bispings a asshole but why do you want a known cheater to beat him for fucks sake i would understand if you wanted any one else in the division to beat him but not yoel romero
MMA,removed,tyron might not be the most likable but thats the thing a black guy does get away with a lot less than anyone else he should realize though that most watchers and commenters of mma are white dudes who dont give a fuck about the race issue will just use this as an excuse to hate him more
MMA,removed,so youre comparing the nba fan base to mmas also i never said he wasnt a mega star because hes black its just hilarious how as soon as he says anything about race all the retards come out of the woodwork to lambaste him if you dont think that the majority of the ufcs fan base are a bunch of insecure white dudes then you are terribly mistaken
MMA,removed,eh thats pretty dumb theres always someone who has worse problems than you but it doesnt mean your problems arent valid the fact of the matter is that black dudes have to be objectively better than everyone else to get any respect tyron might be annoying but he doesnt get any slack jeez just look at the comment sections
MMA,removed,thats how trump supporters think lmao
MMA,removed,lolyup because people cant make mistakesoops i mean only white people can and people forget about it
MMA,removed,if everyone could keep the race wars out of mma that would be great white guy
MMA,removed,nah hes just a bitter guy he does that to everyone
MMA,removed,i should have said white people in the us like to pretend that racism doesnt exist anymore
MMA,removed,cool again no one at all cares about your opinion of him keep it to yourself instead of just being a douche for no reason
MMA,removed,im pretty sure wonderboy wouldnt be cool with kkk association
MMA,removed,did u not read what i said i said he knew you dick wads were trolling and
MMA,removed,tyron from the hoodley guaranteed to get more fans now that hes insulted them all and made everyone uncomfortable about not enjoying his workmanlike attitude towards fighting and promotion
MMA,removed,theres a looooooot of white fragility in this comment section lmao
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,youre a maniac who did duffy beat and who did conor beat how did they beat them what were their records going into the fight
MMA,removed,her roided ass should stay out of the ufc shes basically a man
MMA,removed,theres an alt right movement in france right now its not very effective but it highlights a segment of the population that are uneducated and scared just like in the us with trump france is a mixed bag like the us in terms of racial tolerance
MMA,removed,lommy your a fucking asshole lets just call it like it is here
MMA,removed,wait so you are saying you dont care why he is in the ufc in first place geeze man i wonder why you even care at all then thats the thing a guy like mickey gall who had pro fight in the ufc destroyed and fucked up cm punk what makes you think any other fighter in the ufc will do less to him he is in the ufc if you even have a clue what that means
MMA,removed,youre clearly such an expert on racism white guy you definitely know the nuances of what black people experience
MMA,removed,well your username gives it away for one
MMA,removed,they should just have those fighters on canadian cards since our new leader is so erratic with his executive power
MMA,removed,in what way he speaks well is fun to watch is an amazing athlete is a good family man etc everything youd want in a champion people seem to dislike him solely because he brings up the issue of race in mma its weird how people get ridiculously defensive over it
MMA,removed,no the lie that athleyes arent effected along with other apologist lies
MMA,removed,thats great news we get to see browne and ed get embarrassed once more
MMA,removed,fascinating you conclude that he has received favorable treatment in every aspect of his career based on one decision you arent too bright are you
MMA,removed,or as a ufc champion woodley had earned the right to use that platform to highlight an issue which he thinks is a problem and is being ignored in this sport i honestly dont understand why people are so triggered and defensive over this woodley is in a better position than anyone to talk about this issue and if he feels that there is a problem he has every right to talk about it and open up a discussion but people dont want to discuss theyd rather just put their fingers in their ears and automatically dismiss it
MMA,removed,doesnt mean its not an issue though does it maybe it just means that noone has had the balls it bring it up until woodley and i can see why judging from the reaction on this thread
MMA,removed,wut
MMA,removed,wonderboy has confederate flag bed sheets of course hed say that
MMA,removed,the whole order is illegal anyway so he can just do whatever he wants right
MMA,removed,i think youre missing the point no what they meant is that black people are more easily described as well spoken or articulate the point is that they dont actually have to be particularly articulate to receive that compliment just not speaking with the expected black accent if enough to challenge the preconceived ideas held by those who are unfamiliar with the black community so they want to acknowledge what they see as being exceptionally articulate and well spoken for a black person well meaning racism on the other hand cruz is just very very articulate im no expert
MMA,removed,and that fighters name albert einstein
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,personally terrified really guy you are personally terrified whats your address can i mail you some tissues for your fearful weeping
MMA,removed,people say nobody is racist against him a good number of people who comment on instagram are idiots and yes racist
MMA,removed,lets face it majority of mma fan are white people and if tyrone wants to be more popular he needs to reach out to the black male but thats hard cause that group is already heavy into basketball and football
MMA,removed,because you probably enjoy thinking before making decisions unlike a certain person
MMA,removed,oh yeah whens the last time woodley confronted a lynch mob
MMA,removed,this seems bad to say but she claims miller mounted her and punched her repeatedly in the face but showed no facial injuries that is consistent with mayhems standup his crappy punching got him off the charges
MMA,removed,so many butt hurt liberals in here god damn
MMA,removed,he hosted what one ufc event and was involved with that shitshow affliction its not even about trumps mma supporting record the figure head of the ufc and arguably mma publicly backed this racist morally bankrupt narcissistic wannabe tyrant dor the highest office in the land in time that will bite us all in the ass
MMA,removed,autism much
MMA,removed,lol i remember nate calling caraway the biggest fag in the world
MMA,removed,sorry you cant criticize donald trump on this sub people here have a fetish for asshole strongmen like fedor and chael sonnen
MMA,removed,lets not pretend that he isnt retarded because he is retarded
MMA,removed,compared to the fucktards on youtube chat yeah fucking phds
MMA,removed,sifu stfu
MMA,removed,why dat ass is more than enough for everyone
MMA,removed,nope just a kick ass username or were you just sucking the diaz brothers dicks and think they have the type of boxing talent to beat the best at boxing why if they are so concerned with what they are getting paid have they not made the transition to boxing for the money they are better than most of mma at throwing hands but are not champion level boxers if they were they would be chasing the money
MMA,removed,nah fuck u conor dick riding bitch

MMA,removed,were you the one sticking the needle in brocks ass or something you seem to have insider information no one else does
MMA,removed,newlysigned fighters there is a completely separate rule for retired fighters so shut the fuck up about newly signed fighters the exception is built into the rule in the first place and it has restrictions the fact that they want to copromote summerslam doesnt satisfy he restrictions you drama queens are the only ones whining mark hunt is a drama queen for pointing out that the ufc is bypassing the rule its a normal situation that nobody has a problem with its not a normal situation it has never happened before apparently the guy fighting brock has a problem with it but as long as you think its fair ufc isnt damaging its reputation by sidestepping the rules they were shamed into adopting
MMA,removed,brock fucked this losers mom and hes mad

MMA,removed,what loose moral compass the difference its not big enought to excuse the difference in reactions okay thank you doctor for your scientific research your personal opinion is more valid than scientific papers that educated people have put years in their lives to produce if cyborg was a beautiful girl and juiced as fuck like those really famous fitgirls or crossfit girls i dont think this conversation would have happened to be honest with you i dont care about her being beautiful or not i care about her having the punching power of a man because of her usage of male hormones and if cyborg was american or european even less people would react badly this is what i think ah yes and you top it of by being a racist i cant make a post of a valid topic because you think im a rich white male living in a palace and hate brown people fuck you this is what i think

MMA,removed,round the leech is looking like the better striker hes landing some nice leg kicks and hitting lead right hands one of them a beautiful cross counter its looking like a clear round for the leech with about seconds to go in the round with leech also stuffing takedowns from the collegiate wrestler nash then nash not only drops leech but attempts a no hooks in rear naked choke and maintains a dominant position for the rest of the round round nash carries the momentum he had to end round and is tagging leech with some big shots leech stands his ground and returns fire a lull in action on the fence a deserved break in my opinion before leech himself not turns the tables and eventually knocks nash out fantastic back and forth fight that had moments of craziness but both fighters were still able to maintain some semblance of punching technique both showed their heart both came to fight i hope they were compensated extra somehow cause they definitely deserved fight of the night imo

MMA,removed,dana white voted for trump this is a conspiracy
MMA,removed,then shut ur fuckin mouth
MMA,removed,he hasnt done enough yet huh
MMA,removed,puts on tinfoil hat it all makes sense now thats why weidman supported trump to duck the moose
MMA,removed,none
MMA,removed,its not totally obnoxious to me kind of obnoxiously comical at times at best and definitely overrated but will you expand upon any reasons why hes a rather shitty person and do you think its bad to really actively root hard against all these scumbag trump supporters
MMA,removed,dana supported trump
MMA,removed,lol this dunce said he preferred trump over hillary
MMA,removed,crap
MMA,removed,haha yea like this guy asking lawler if he ever thought about having his hands up
MMA,removed,im not on anyones side and hate politics but important to note obama passed an act last year to make it extremely hard to enter the country if you have been in one of the countries that trump has temporarily banned sure trump enforced it but obama laid the foundations for the executive order
MMA,removed,i feel exactly this way fuck trump havent openly cared but if the moose cant get loose than im going to be upset
MMA,removed,remember when mousasi said he liked trump
MMA,removed,of course thats why trump didnt ban muslims from countries where he has business interests
MMA,removed,looks like a teenagerovergrown baby this style blows
MMA,removed,influence of a boogieman the ctr thing is so stupid whether the amount was million or million trump supporters have been going on since spring about how ctr is controlling reddit and twitter and facebook and every other comment section it would cost way more than that to control social media for that length of time like a silly amount more its far more likely that the hillary supporter you disagree with is simply that a hillary supporter than it is that theyre a paid shill just like the donald people i disagree with are probably just people who i think are stupid assholes rather than russian agents the banning on rthedorito is because theyre pathetically thin skinned like their candidate
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,ok but seriouslywe all know thats not the only thing shes taken women dont look like her naturally

MMA,removed,lmao thank you pc culture
MMA,removed,youre a bitch
MMA,removed,the downside to being able to absorb ungodly amounts of damage to his face is that he bleeds like a virgin on prom night
MMA,removed,men boosting their man juice production isnt the same as a woman that doesnt naturally produce it getting on it
MMA,removed,i mean jesus fucking christ dudeseriously really jesus christ told us she took anabolic steroids and she has acromegaly and a mini cock for a clit ok cant we just trust jesus

MMA,removed,not really saying ill stab you could imply other means if he had said that it could be said he threatened to stab me saying he threatened me with a knife is a different very distinct and specific threat possibly with either a remark or visual representation
MMA,removed,good job reebok andor new owners from here on i free stream everything even how to lose fans

MMA,removed,you do realize that there can be more than one word to describe something in the same way and you do realize that famous can be used for something positive and negative dont come at me trying to flex your inteligence you look like a fool
MMA,removed,lol connor is retarded indeed the money has made him a retarded leprechaun
MMA,removed,what a bunch of soft cocks
MMA,removed,is that uspez on the far right
MMA,removed,you twit thats an article quote from from a yahoo sports writer who has been a boxing writer for years damn youre dumb you just make shit up what the fuck are you talking about do you have brain damage yeah any boxer would be killed if they tried mma you know like when ray mercer ktfo the former ufc hw champ in seconds yeah former fighter past his prime seconds or when the womens boxing champ holly holm came to mma and ktfo the greatest in human history rousey in less than round by boxing her face off then she got choked the fuck out by the woman who lost to rhonda twice the reason was because rhonda got cocky and tried to box her and obviously she would lose a boxing match holm is on a losing streak lmao couldnt even defend once not to mention she actually fucking trained mma she didnt just hop into the octagon cant tell if youre fucking with me or just this retarded
MMA,removed,because this utheclashoftitans douche and all the other ones in this thread cant accept that their mma idols are friends with a mass murderer and that this mass murderer has a lot of connections to their beloved mma world its embarrassing that people like clashoftitans are upvoted so much really shows what this sports fanbase is like lol

MMA,removed,shut the fuck up

MMA,removed,is the same kid who thinks woodly is a better striker than mcgregor lol
MMA,removed,because hes vocal about them and thus opens himself to criticism you stupid fuck
MMA,removed,rmma today you are embarassing yourself get the fuck off dc dick worse than any mcgregor or antimcgregor on this sub the comments here are unbelievable dc could kill a baby at this point and people would be saying he did what he had to do to put the baby out of the pain and agony of life
MMA,removed,no he wouldnt have beaten him with ease yes he would have salido gets put there to loose he got humiliated by marquez gamboa mikey garcia and even fucking rocky martinez beat him lmfao i love how butthurt that loss makes lomachenko fanboys salido was always a mediocre fighter until he beat lomachenko and now suddenly even floyd would lose to him get the fuck out of here with that bullshit again mayweather already had pro fights at that point he was years old a literal old man by boxing standards lomachenko was in his damn prime and he got beat salido is a mediocre fighter who beat lomachenko i hope they never have a rematch just so you can remain forever butthurt

MMA,removed,today i learned sam alvey is an idiot
MMA,removed,because all the views you hold are proven to be factually correct and irrefutable just because you disagree with someone on a single issue and i agree that alvey is totally wrong doesnt mean theyre an idiot idiot
MMA,removed,people are sceptical when it comes to unions and i cant blame them what really annoys me is that whenever you even try to go against the local opinion youll get shit on and called names without any substantial arguments some scandinavian dude said heyy im from scandinavia and unions are the greatest thing in the world and they treat him like some sort of authority what i can say the opposite on the basis of my nationality and id get downvoted i really just think most people just have strong opinions and validate them by being hostile towards one another on here lol
MMA,removed,it amazes me how every fighter thinks they are going to be as big as conor and make the same money they truly have the biggest egos haha
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up buddeh

MMA,removed,so now were hating on joe thought the circlejerk loved him i personally think hes a piece of shit with a little mans complex
MMA,removed,i personally wont consider conor a division champ if he wins it would be along the lines of bj or couture to me the ufc have done all they can to make this happen for him theyd never let mighty mouse go fight in another division for a year and after fights call him the champ in both weight divisions
MMA,removed,im all for firing duners there is no room for them in the ufc
MMA,removed,well in ireland we measure all of our seats in leprechaun sizes so really its only about in full human sized seats at croke park fuck me
MMA,removed,holm is juiced to the tits too though lets not pretend

MMA,removed,lol so funny i always laugh out loud when i type normal things too hahaha lololil
MMA,removed,i think it is going to be interesting to watch this not because it is going to be a good fight dom needs to fight mm or tj plain and simple however if dom can get a finish it will boost him into the stratosphere of marketability
MMA,removed,sushi fuck pats a freak is he
MMA,removed,hopefully joe silva dies in a fire short little bitch

MMA,removed,i am indifferent no youre definitely not what you are is colossally full of shit ok the next time someone mentions mcgregor calling siver a nazi keep this in mind do you see me bitching and moaning about that
MMA,removed,why are you so worked up about kevin lee lmao i literally dont care about him which you clearly do yet youre here in a thread about him talking about him getting mad over him no its quite obvious that you do care about kevin lee despite your insistence to the contrary you bitch and moan about his trash talk a lot uh what ive quite clearly said that i dont fault mcgregor for saying the shit he does because its how he sells his fights what does annoy me are the mouthbreathing fans who parrot everything he says and try to act like him oh shit look at your username isnt that funny
MMA,removed,why on earth do you enjoy fighting it seems like getting punched in the head for a living would be painful
MMA,removed,hi heres a summary of what an ad hominem is httprationalwikiorgwikiargumentumadhominem from the latin to the person is an informal logical fallacy that occurs when someone attempts to refute an argument by attacking the source making it rather than the argument itself the fallacy is a subset of the httprationalwikiorgwikigeneticfallacy as it attacks the source of the argument which is irrelevant to to the truth or falsity of the argument an ad hominem should not be confused with an insult which attacks the person but does not seek to rebut the persons argument
MMA,removed,i came way too hard in your sister fucked in her asshole
MMA,removed,pÃ³g mo thÃ³in
MMA,removed,probably just scared of roided up gorillas because youre an average man ftfy
MMA,removed,the only reason a division even makes halfway sense is because of cyborg of course they were supposed to wait for her the title fight on is no better than the happy meal interim belts the ufc hands out several times a year now if cyborg was a popular fighter this entire sub would complain but its cyborg so fuck her
MMA,removed,i mean at this point with all the testosterone shes taken shes basically a preop tranny she should fight fallon fox for the trannyweight belt
MMA,removed,youre also a lot more annoying max
MMA,removed,who da fook is dat guy
MMA,removed,i think you have a large child porn collection
MMA,removed,httpwwwmmaweeklycomnatediazsaysbothbensonhendersonandjoshthomsonshouldhavelostintwitterrant go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,yeah because aldo got ktfo
MMA,removed,a black cuban jew nazi checks out
MMA,removed,yeah but styles make fights everyone was also saying woodley also looked mediocre before the lawler fight i think pettis has the right style to beat holloway and i think hes going to ko him via a body shot the key to beating pettis is pressure but this has to be pressure on the feet combined with the cagetakedown threat holloway can only bring the pressure on the feet he isnt going to be taking pettis down like rda or alvarez was holloway ate numerous head kicks against lamas which is very concerning against the guy with potentially the best head kick set ups and the best body kicker in the sport ill give max enough credit to say hell eat pettis shots but i think hes going to get caught with a hard body kick when his relatively wild boxing gives pettis an opening
MMA,removed,triggered much holy cow
MMA,removed,shoulda came out to fat joes lean back
MMA,removed,yeah simpsonville is definitely more suburban than rural
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,so youre the lone asshole arguing that a kod fighter should have to do a post fight interview
MMA,removed,you seem ignorant as fuck
MMA,removed,stfu you goof
MMA,removed,dude he snuck it in there thank god he didnt say it in the same way terrorists seem to do because trump would have him killed i would imagine that of america would freak out hearing that too
MMA,removed,cyborg fan boys be like she didnt tweet that her pr people did fuck cyborg this salty bitch should either make or shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,fuck eddie for spoiling this news like a complete asshole at that pre fight presser made me lose all respect for him instantly

MMA,removed,and a great ass
MMA,removed,fucking dickhead
MMA,removed,deleteddd
MMA,removed,im replying to a comment directed at me dude youre just kinddddda being a jerkoff is it that hard to realize that
MMA,removed,it doesnt helps when the majority conors fans are insufferable douchebags who live vicariously through conor and feel the need to react like that what other fighters fans have been so cancerous and vitriolic to their fighters opponents maybe besides jones its pathetic theyre the fratbro type that think theyre tough until they get hit
MMA,removed,and the hatetrain begins all over again so the man knocked out the division goat in seconds jumped up weight classes came back down and dominated the champ in rounds and hes still ducking people yeah mate you keep being you
MMA,removed,yeah that one the frankie edgarjeremy stephens fight and the two before them they usually air the first couple of fights on fight pass but for the most part ppv prelims always air exclusively on fox sports i usually have to find some kind of stream which has never failed to be a hassle flawed if you ask me but thats just how it is
MMA,removed,i will miss those boobs that ass
MMA,removed,trolllllll
MMA,removed,anthony pettis is former champion and a legend of the sport you are a in your moms basement do you now see why tmz values anthonys call out of mcgregor over yours
MMA,removed,it sure would be and khabib should get on it as for drunk irish people in vegas im not sure what your point even is both russians and irish and other europeans can all be brought into mma fandom and become viable markets these arent mutually exclusive if i take a flight to the next continent over book hotels buy food buy tickets use transport then youre damned fucking right im gonna have me a drink too other than being vaguely racist you just sound like an asshole or an year old and i dont really know what one is worse
MMA,removed,what seems more plausible you a baby read my comment and reported it or a random mod in a thread with over comments was reading the same comment chain and read mine mins after i posted and thought thats out of order delete hmmmmmmm
MMA,removed,what was bigotry please show me
MMA,removed,i will call whoever i want king shitlord
MMA,removed,not that much
MMA,removed,change the fucken tune bitch lose muscle mass and shut the fuck up she bought the ticket but doesnt want to take the ride
MMA,removed,khabib will rape conor but conor will never take the fight theres coke to do people
MMA,removed,look i am the number one conor dickrider but the guy literally could not beat a small child
MMA,removed,not really they arent crazy different
MMA,removed,in regards to naming and amount hoping he goes the george foreman route now who will be his ali or if conor is already ali diaz is already frazier looking forward to the conor mcgrill in or an conor mcgregor leprechaun themed slot machine available in casinos all over the world
MMA,removed,sorry i wasnt fact checking in my mums basement at the time whilst hyperventilating into my cheetos packet about someone being wrong on the internet i was actually on my coffee break at work
MMA,removed,alright well i guess we can stop pretending you know what the fuck youre talking about enjoy being objectively wrong were done here
MMA,removed,gtfo they fought twice this year and nate was barely ranked a trilogy is necessary for what reason exactly
MMA,removed,something something rape sweater
MMA,removed,im the biggest connor fan everybody knows that im a connor dick rider but the khabib matchub is just tough man
MMA,removed,wrestlefuck would def be tko or submission gsps grappling is lightyears ahead of conner i see conner taking that fight inly if it is his last fight where he is just cashing in and getting out i can totally see him doing that he has been able to get the best matchups for himself and make a nice chunk of change he doesnt seem to be a guy that is going to stick around fighting for a long time
MMA,removed,in case anyone is wondering where the bisping confirmation comes from dana is saying that the winner of romero and weidman faces bisping next
MMA,removed,dana before the fight was answering some questions live via facebook and said that bisping gets the winner of romeroweidman here
MMA,removed,ireland says enough
MMA,removed,hey save my add me as a friend or keep in touch whenever a ufc ppv is out ill provide you with streaming links to watch for free online

MMA,removed,thats weird fellow german here and ive never had problems with ranfighting so far no time jumps no black screen and always at least i bought ufc and now and since those events have been the most watched and thus most loaded servers i just assumed its all good appearently i have just been lucky but man that sucks when i had the same problem with metamoris a couple of years ago i started to watch to watch the shows via an illegal stream without remorse you should do the same now i kinda miss the prefightpassera every event was free for germans even the ppvs also fuck
MMA,removed,i like how all of these dumbfucks are trying to push the false narrative that nate is pounds heavier
MMA,removed,get he fuck off rmma nobody wants to talk about hypothetical fights with superheroes with no sanctioned fights
MMA,removed,my biggest complaint is regarding ufc on its ok most of the time since i can stream the eventscards on my computer by way of comcasts live tv web service unfortunately ufc on fox and are not available to me which forces me to obtain their content by legally questionable means any time an event is broadcast through these channels it would be nice if i could stream all live events on fightpass im not sure what the details of the fox deal are but it seems theyre sticking to an outdated business model that i hope would die very soon ill gladly pay just a little bit more for my fightpass subscription shit i might even consider viewing ads during the prelims but the fact that sometimes their content is simply not available to me and countless other fans is a bit frustrating
MMA,removed,thats what happens when youre the first to give her a creampie your dna bonds with her and she becomes your bitch never let your first love go

MMA,removed,conor was talking about how he was going to butcher his face so it was unrecognizable lol again keep the downvotes flowing facts are facts
MMA,removed,no hes just honest jackass he obviously believes what he says otherwise he wouldnt be where he is
MMA,removed,so why isnt anybody calling eddie alvarez a cheat hes blatantly fucking jacked with a ridiculous gas tank yoel is innocent until proven you bunch of cunts

MMA,removed,pfftfound the whipped nice guy bitches be everywhere only one opportunity to watch live sling that dick some other time
MMA,removed,idk i think a lot of people learned about rooting for history over practicality during election year of else for conor to go from here unless he goes after another belt anyone he fights after that is like hes a step down for conor in terms of entertainment
MMA,removed,he says he took about a year to get used to his new body his last fight was may usada started testing august good on him for making the proper adjustments looking forward to the leaner cleaner and meaner thiago alves
MMA,removed,shut your whore mouth shut it shit it all the way the fuck up

MMA,removed,wrong hand dipshit
MMA,removed,hes a douche fuck him
MMA,removed,finally this country will be great again
MMA,removed,i think its obvious at this point that khabib has a very distorted pov from his religion to thinking ariel betrayed him to thinking conor is ducking or will duck him
MMA,removed,conor haters are easily the most pathetic community on rmma the guy helped further bring mma in the mainstream made the ufc more money and giets knockouts and exciting fights every time he steps into the ring but keep being salty
MMA,removed,i just cant imagine conor keeping up with eddie rda is still one of my favourites but he needs to change his game i think his game has become a little rigidhe wasnt able to adjust against ferguson but for connie i wish you lots of luck
MMA,removed,this is a youtube level argument he makes some decent arguments but of course hes got to be a hater for fucks sake
MMA,removed,the only king is the underground king war eddie

MMA,removed,rnottheonion i am a bot i link the subreddits mentioned in the title for easy navigation
MMA,removed,racism really has nothing to do with it plenty of minority fighters are absolutely beloved you do realize its possible to be racist towards one say black athlete and not racist in general or specifically towards another black athlete right for example someone can think magic johnson was the greatest thing since sliced bread but refer to some other black athletes or even black people as niggers and dont get defensive if this doesnt apply to you but there are a lot of people out there like the ones i just described
MMA,removed,i personally cannot imagine anything being worse than getting hit in your face but there are apparently people who think the opposite mma stands for mixed martial arts thats the worldwide term for freefight but its more known as cagefightingfighting with no rules here in the netherlands mma has the same basic techniques as but were allowed to grab people to use wrestlingtakedowns and continue fighting on the ground and to use chokes and submissions so were allowed to pretty much do whatever we want except for dirty fighting could you show me show techniques yes sure like that near your chin that hurts why did you kick my ass dickhead resiliencestamina is also a part of it ah shit that doesnt work on you my turn girl starts moaning are you alright yes im fine once again youre going to defend your title in america on august the could you elaborate on that its gonna be a very important fight becuase mma is starting to grow in america and i believe that its gonna be as big as boxing in the next years were starting to see a decrease in the boxing popularity and an increase in the mma popularity youve already showed me the standup game could you show me some chokeslocks now are you sure its way different than getting hit sit in this position and then im gonna do like this perform a choke girl starts moaning and this is a back mount choke now if i very slowly squeeze my muscles try to escape taps no i couldnt escape because youre a sexy mofoe i won then continues moaning everything alright yes how did you do that shows how to perform a guillotine choke and if your technique is wrong you wont be able to lock it good in and it will simply not work then yes like this you might feel some pain simply because im a strong ass mofoe but its not as painful as when you actually have good technique tries to suplex here sorry but may i quickly say the ending words okay this was it it was fun but also kinda scary i also got some knowledgable about mma but i dont really know yet if its something for me but okay there can be only one winner and thats definitely me camera man stops recording and ubereem takes the girls into a locked room to get some s u c c
MMA,removed,always has to be a scotsman who acts like a dickhead for no reason after someone just said something nice about scotland which by the way there aint a lot of nice things to say about scotland quicker you lot fuck off out of the uk the better
MMA,removed,yeah he should act more mature like you
MMA,removed,youre a typical fucking young idiot who knows nothing and decides to spout his worthless opinion take a look at history and youll see that commentators and journalists trying to consider how outoftraining factors have played a role in losses has existed since the dawn of professional highprofile fighting if you look at interviews or even fights of joe frazier youll see mentions of how his musical career joe frazier and the knockouts may have contributed to his loss to foreman it was a very apt and insightful comment that goldberg made his only mistake was overestimating the intelligence of his pseudointellectual commentating partner and fans like you
MMA,removed,youre a ridiculous individual what crusade lol i asked a question i got downvoted and had people complaining the thread aka bothered fair assumption right and you come in with a dipshit answer and im the one with a crusade do you want to fight me irl i might not win but i have heart
MMA,removed,thats such a stupid argument shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,this thread is a case study in the difference in reactions between a normal fighter action coming from a favorite or someone people dont like thread is ful of peolle throwin their cards on the table and admitting they hate cody for no reason why he has tattoos this sub is a cesspool sometimes

MMA,removed,dont lump randleman in with samman sammans death was because he overdosed on illegal drugs his death shouldnt be celebrated it should be used to tell people to stay away from drugs
MMA,removed,can we stop pretending this guy was a hero he died because he odd on heroin it was his own fault and pretending it wasnt doesnt send the right message

MMA,removed,there isnt a need for a womens only gym either you can revel in y your rape fantasies all day but a womens only gym isnt stopping rape if women are allowed to be uncomfortable because a man is on the gym men can be uncomfortable about a woman being at the barber shop

MMA,removed,and somehow this shit only matters to mma fans plenty of people watch football that never played thats fine but somehow to the mma autists you have to have a pro record before youre qualified to enjoy watching something

MMA,removed,that doesnt mean he should be a hw silvas previously undefeated record at lhw doesnt mean he should be lhw if silva had beaten dc it doesnt mean that by proxy silva should be a hw since dc can beat hws your logic is shitty just stfu and stop replying to this shit
MMA,removed,we worship anderson more than anyone jones and cormier are also one of the most popular guys here so fuck off with your race card
MMA,removed,id use your husband as a condom and there is nothing he could do to stop me
MMA,removed,mmamania jon anik fuck off

MMA,removed,that makes no sense you dumbasd
MMA,removed,httpiimgurcomcuoygwxjpg
MMA,removed,just because slurs arent like you doesnt mean you can call them pejoratives try again shitlord
MMA,removed,oh yeah she pooling alright hngggggggggggg olviiiii
MMA,removed,is roman greco proper for ordinary self defense though not that i know what im talking about in the world of mma but i read that judo would be good because it helps keep you from going to the ground and wrestling is pretty much all ground as far as im aware im worried that if the person attacking me has friends ill be an easy target for a kick to the head or something i just want to make sure i pick the best option for someone in my fat condition who just wants to protect himself if the need arises if others agree with you i will definitely check it out
MMA,removed,do you mean cheap pricewise or not nearly as effective as bjj
MMA,removed,i didnt even think about the aspect you refer to as mcdojos kind of had this subconscious thought that somehow mma gyms wouldnt engage in that behavior would it be rude of me to ask an instructor if i could observe a class that would give me info on their worthiness
MMA,removed,its a mind set and toughness that isnt as present in other martial arts is greco roman greekroman suitable for someone completely out of shape and with no background i will work my hardest to do well wherever im at but i dont want to feel overwhelmed
MMA,removed,bbbut dana did it himself because hes evil and wants to help the shouty leprechaun man
MMA,removed,well my normal weight is about lbs yep im that overweight im not huge or maybe ive slowly morphed into a bigish dude and havent noticed it i think i could do well though once i get to working out i bulk up well it looks like wrestling is a good choice for me having a little difficulty finding a gym on google thats not meant for teens though think i might try to find a wrestling specific forum and see if there are any locals with recommendations
MMA,removed,they were wronghes a pro athlete now but if it makes you feel better you were fat and arent one
MMA,removed,mvp could be a huge star but hell never make it to the ufc rose i doubt it she has zero chance of beating jj and if youre not champ in that division andor insanely good looking youll have a hard time getting over shes cute shes a talented fighter but she isnt dominant she isnt super sexy and it sounds like she has downs when she talks the ship on her becoming a breakout star has sailed dern definitely has the potential but we have no idea how good she is vannata no fan favorite probably but not a star choi i think he might be a future champ and hell be massive in asia i doubt hell get over with english speaking and brazilians crowds imo yair garbrandt khabib stipe wonderboy choi holloway jimmie rivera pena these are the fighters that can be future stars
MMA,removed,page will never make it to the ufc bellator will lock him down for life
MMA,removed,this is exactly the video that raised questions to me he is absolutely massive in this postfight interview much more than he was at the end of his career he just looks much different here a lot fuller
MMA,removed,there is zero evidence of bisping juicing he has looked and performed the same his entire career i think its pretty telling hes finally winning the fights he used to lose once usada was implemented the guy only has three legit losses in my book rashad rockhold and kennedy the rest were juiced to the gills
MMA,removed,to quote willie d from the geto boys left right left youre toothless make a nga say damn they ruthless
MMA,removed,funny how fanboys still plead that hes natural
MMA,removed,and i thought it hyperextended nates knee it looked brutal
MMA,removed,what a dumb fucking comment
MMA,removed,that headline is like its written by a divorced mother taken to her year old daughter about her year old son there is no we you mong
MMA,removed,not enough if you need a gofundme fam as your first backup this cheerio head is he doesnt have an hsa fsa roth or too late to invest in that shit bugga
MMA,removed,all that plus his belly and nipples sure some guys have puffy nips some have massive delts some have huge traps others have big muscular bellies but all of them combined cmon now add in the fact he out muscled and destroyed everyone in a time when practically everyone was on something including known users i think its pretty damn obvious
MMA,removed,lol at anyone believing a word rampage says he leaves the ufc and bad mouths them he then leaves bellator for the ufc then bad mouths bellator then leaves the ufc again for bellator bad mouthing ufc in the process cmon now regardless like i said mikes fighting style has been the same hes pulling away from those close fights he used to lose to known users and yes hes on a tear he beat silva and rockhold for christ sake
MMA,removed,i approve as long as its big john goddard or dean ill be happy
MMA,removed,when jones is suspended could he just use peds like a motherfucker without getting tested i mean years of steroids damn
MMA,removed,lmao are you dumb youve clearly never watched her fight in muay thai and kickboxing she doesnt take punishment at all shes a very technical counter striker with extremely good timing about the opposite of what you say holm fights at one range long range she looks mediocre every time she faces someone who isnt aggressive and charging in shevchenko is a better kicker puncher and striker in every range except for long range if holm can impose her reach and size advantage she wins if not shes done for
MMA,removed,lol fuck off
MMA,removed,no fuck off
MMA,removed,they can also stack sentences for multiple infractions which means a possible year suspension
MMA,removed,the guy has delts and traps of a greek god puffy nipples and an hgh gut which are all signs of ped use sure all of those things are possible to have but all at the same time add in the fact he outmuscled and destroyed known steroid users and he was the most dominant champion in an era where everyone was using i think its safe to say he was on something
MMA,removed,i think hes a top possibly top ww in the world his striking is one of the best in all of mma at the end of the day he could be a pretender he hasnt faced anyone of note or anyone to challenge him hes been taken down i wonder how hed do on his back against a hendricks woodley rory maia gastelum or nelson
MMA,removed,the guy has delts and traps of a greek god puffy nipples and an hgh gut which are all signs of ped use sure all of those things are possible to have but all at the same time add in the fact he outmuscled and destroyed known steroid users and he was the most dominant champion in an era where everyone was using plus he said one of the main reasons he left the sport was because of lack of testing yet hasnt returned when the strictest testing ever is introduced i think its safe to say he was on something
MMA,removed,the way he does it is pretty insane this coming from someone that usually holds the wait until he faces real competition view i agree he might be a can but from watching a lot of mma he definitely seems like a top ww at least
MMA,removed,pedantic but i think its more of a jabstraight righthookkick each one sets your body up in a way to deliver the next move with as efficient a motion as possible thats what they taught at nova uniao
MMA,removed,no its call fighting not for pussies like you you fight til the ref stops you no legal hit is cheap
MMA,removed,very well written and the point is well made theres a reason we call them freakshow fights and squash matches we acknowledge that they are not real fights in the same way evenly matched fights are
MMA,removed,lol i had to look that up i cant believe it
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,there are a lot of solid refs and only a few bad ones i just put those three on another level every main event should be one of those three
MMA,removed,theyd probably freeze his suspension until he unretired
MMA,removed,you can cry and cum at the same time youve never hidden in a closet and jacked off while some other guy fucks your wife weirdo
MMA,removed,cyborg and rafael cavalcante
MMA,removed,always thought bones would get foremand by him bad matchup imo bones and dc have very different styles of wrestling and bones isnt known for his chain wrestling and pressurepace which johnson historically crumbles against
MMA,removed,ehm no dummy he does those kicks because circling away from the left side is how to counter any southpaw he doesnt force an opponent to move to the left by doing that he punishes the fact that they are moving to the right theres a very big difference it doesnt set anything up front snaps to the body also are used to wind opponents and are especially effective with the opponent up against the cage that doesnt set anything up lead leg side kicks are distance managers high snapping roundhouse kicks are damaging techniques you set up high roundhouses a strike like that cant actually set anything else up other than spinning techniques im done arguing with parrots
MMA,removed,the fact that you arent funny shouldnt be laid at my feet chief
MMA,removed,you talking shit about conors retarded gorilla
MMA,removed,whatever you say fatty
MMA,removed,why did you suddenly become an asshole
MMA,removed,mcgregor could take all of them at once
MMA,removed,how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think i need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
MMA,removed,you guys are lame af you talk shit about any fighter that even looks at your prince but if anyone even mentions his name youll loose your mind lol i wasnt serious you fucks xd go be mad about something â
MMA,removed,whats with the racism in this thread
MMA,removed,tirteen seconds
MMA,removed,ill definitely be downloading this via torrent sorry conor
MMA,removed,yea when you post anything thats even a tiny bit anti mcgregor the nut huggers start to pms awesome video nonetheless though
MMA,removed,maybe kavanagh should behave like a coach and stop predicting knockouts then httpsnpredditcomrfuckyou
MMA,removed,making assumptions only one of which number is correct check quit being a crybaby
MMA,removed,ujoelauzondotcom get rekt
MMA,removed,pre did you not see what chad mendes did to jose aldo and then conor kod him flat his chin is clearly gone and without his steroids hes a bum usada jose is a bum post wow jose is back and better than ever was a fluke conors a bum with no chin and no will power post conor is the greatest fighter in the history of mma jose got flattened like a bitch nate got flattened like a bitch they all get flattened elcuck your claims are unsubstantiated until we see how robbie holds up in future bouts youre only setting yourself up for future embarrassment and flip flopping
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,when do i defend his honor i go around fucking around and throwing conor memes around all yall get all riled up its pretty hilarious did you really expect to find downvoted mcgregor posts from the search button lmao
MMA,removed,nagger or nerger
MMA,removed,lol dont jerk yourself too hard there
MMA,removed,he seems like a redneck
MMA,removed,yes it does matter those words have different meanings in this day and age
MMA,removed,giving what back there was actually a fan qa for him jose where a fan asked what they had done for the community and there you can see where the dude really stands might have done something after but if hes as smart as his fans make him out to be then one can also look at charity as business strategy that way it cannot be argued but its the intention that counts things that cant be seen also i think fighters know that running around showing your ass to the world gets you attention but what it is is really that humility can be sold never bought why do you think some fighters refuse to act in this manner and the ones that refuse are often the ones from the poorest backgrounds eg brazil because they understand the value of humility and respect could mean lifedeath in some places dude is lucky to be from ireland w people like himself had it been elsewhere alot of countries would disown him for bringing shame and dishonour but its what is honour really
MMA,removed,limp dick
MMA,removed,i was expecting conor mcgregor dildo tbh all that talk about changing the bum or something and he doesnt even think of a dildo smh

MMA,removed,nggangger i highly doubt it was er it was probably something like this
MMA,removed,oh jesus another condescending asshole who doesnt know what hes talking about theyre not taking clomid and letro for the slight performance enhancement theyll give you its post cycle therapy constantly is also an exaggeration for how often you need to use test suspension

MMA,removed,nagger
MMA,removed,what a vague meaningless statement heres a better more concrete one a fighter knows more and feels more about the world of fighting than some internet couch potato who though he never trains is fine passing judgment on fighters
MMA,removed,hardcore modding is in effect
MMA,removed,only one way to find out
MMA,removed,after reading some business and some financing articles and books ive noticed that if youre not willing to spend some money than youre not as committed if its free than its value is treated like it has none but i was raised by a jew so i totally get what youre saying

MMA,removed,lol your uneducated donkey post doesnt deserve this response i notice you dont have anderson on you true great list you only have people who are on top or retired on top cause you like many mma fans forget history too quickly and think that unless you retire on top you dont deserve respect for what you were in your prime get a clue you fucking donkey im not on penns dick but if you think hes not a legend of the sport then you need to get your head checked youre just a typical uneducated fucktard fight fan
MMA,removed,you conor fans are fucking delusional
MMA,removed,what a whiny bitch
MMA,removed,they tried to force a love story down your throat in a raunchy comedy about porn stay in your lane judd

MMA,removed,are you insulating that he is really thinking about sucking mans rock hard cock very slowly just praying to be lucky enough to receive a shot of silky tangy cum because thats a little far fetched
MMA,removed,meisha could probably be a same with ronda if she lost some bodyfat and not just regarding her current shape shes always a bit soft on fight night
MMA,removed,probably best to go the opposite way why did you ask it
MMA,removed,you kinda sound like a pussy
MMA,removed,now i gotta find some potato stream for the main card

MMA,removed,to be fair you could say it was a bad decision thats better no idea why people like to argue grammarsemantics when you know exactly what i said lol and yeah its to be fair because to be fair the scenario isnt exactly what he suggested brooks beating mc twice but rather win and draw if were to actually watch the fights to base his ability and future fight predictions like the one against barboza plus english isnt my first language but good job being an ass for no reason
MMA,removed,oh look another troll on rmma what a surprise
MMA,removed,youre a fucking lad
MMA,removed,woodley intentionally backs himself up to the fence in order to implement his bread and butter his powerful right counters his takedown threats by backing himself into a corner other guys tend to bite and follow him closing the distance for him there he either goes for a takedown a right hand or mixes it up to try to catch guys the koscheck fight is a classic example of this look at how woodley backs himself up to the cage up to this point woodley is winning the striking exchange he eats a right hand and starts to back himself up koscheck bites and walks him down to the cage where he believes he will be more dominant then immediately after woodley goes for a takedown which is immediately stuffed by koscheck but woodley mixes in his right hand which lands and pushes koscheck back to the center now woodley takes the center and resets but takes huge steps to back himself into the cage now this time then koscheck yet again bites on the bait and rushes in and is subsequently countered by a bomb and gets knocked out
MMA,removed,she was obscured by a bigger better asshole at the time

MMA,removed,fuckin rudy gay man
MMA,removed,she would have got ktfod with another shot it was a mercy stoppage dont be an idiot
MMA,removed,and that happened right
MMA,removed,it has nothing to do with what she has done for the sport its her being a huge bitch the entire time saying she can beat mayweather talking shit about people for no provocation whatsoever and now her recent antics fuck her she had what was coming for a long time
MMA,removed,next time show her this
MMA,removed,seriously i think the real winner here is conor mcgregor ronda gets a payday to match conors best fight which i believe was nate she gets to skip media and therefore fuck the actual event and in the process disgust everyone with her privilege to an extent not even conor has accomplish and she gets pinballed around the cage and stopped in less time than it took me to find a working stream dana looks stupid the ufc looks silly conor goes from the biggest draw slightly ahead of ronda while dana in his usual state of being totally full of shit maintains that she is the biggest star to the undisputed sole megastar the ufc has bravo so good i want to eat it
MMA,removed,lol this is all so scripted
MMA,removed,trashy tbh lol shut the fuck up dont speak ill of the lioness at a time like this let alone at all
MMA,removed,white knight alert
MMA,removed,as long as she does porncasting couch before she dies i wouldnt mind
MMA,removed,people saying rondas definitely going to kill herself shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,yep anyone on the face of this earth would do that for seconds of punishmentshit id let some one rape me for seconds for million and im a dudeno homo
MMA,removed,shits been posted here times why the fuck do the mods keep deleting it just keep one up you fucks
MMA,removed,female mma is so gay
MMA,removed,she wasted a lot of talent potential and other peoples time and money somehow i dont blame her i guess she just doesnt know better its her camp good lord what a bunch of fucktards you know its not just ronda as they nosedived travis and jakes careers too
MMA,removed,stfu
MMA,removed,yeah anyone sayjng it was an early stoppageyes ive seen people say that is an idiot did they want her to to eat with a straw her entire life herb saved her some brain cells
MMA,removed,douchÃ©
MMA,removed,how about you stfu
MMA,removed,so guys i analysed this fight to the tee my acc that i did it on was called solidghxst but i was banned for days because i told so many people that cody would dominate cruz had no answer landed takedown and it got reversed in an amazing fashion he couldnt answer the proper boxing footwork of cody as well as getting dropped times throughout the fight albeit though i give dom props for not getting finished hes a true fighter i would also like to apologise to the people i may have come across as stubborn and rude but then again it was the same emotion people showed to me calling me an idiot or retard not knowing anything about mma and also saying i was blind so now down to the nitty gritty who was right cruz got schooled this fight and had no answers for anything his best shots were random occasional looping punches which barely damaged cody tell me again how cody is one dimensional how he has no ground game is just a brawler with power no fight iq
MMA,removed,are you just calling him a sleazy shit bag because hes armenian because if so thats statistically accurate
MMA,removed,i dunno if thats really fair maybe shes just a fucking tard when it comes to boxing
MMA,removed,werdum sees this unzips pants
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,i know its just jokes but a lot of you guys are gonna feel like shit if ronda necks herself in the hotel room tonight
MMA,removed,highlights httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnhyzqchcfa
MMA,removed,did tj fuck your wife or something
MMA,removed,didnt shock me it was expected of a guy with a credentials he had people dont expect boxing to work in mma because its mma yet mma boxing is not boxing cody is a former amateur boxing golden glove champion as well as being scouted for ncaa div wrestling as a teen yet he turned it down people wont believe me but i have the screenshots to prove and my other acc that got banned for telling everyone this is going to happen days solidghxst is the account name all the huge upsets came from legit boxing the past years fighters are finally catching up hopefully this is a wake up call for many of them as well as viewers the ronda fight showed it even more legit boxing experience dominates in mma the angles are a lot different the footwork is different and the way you react to how people throw different shots is again completely different cruz had no chance tonight he got schooled dont wanna sound like a dick but this is exactly how everyone sounded to me when they said cruz will embarrass this man victory is so sweet
MMA,removed,highlights httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnhyzqchcfa
MMA,removed,they arent scored by rounds asshole clearly amir wins
MMA,removed,sorry your idiot lost but you gotta take some of your own advice you sound like a fucking dipshit
MMA,removed,er yeahhhh ronda is a county butter face thats why
MMA,removed,man i hope you dont have kids
MMA,removed,thank you edmond
MMA,removed,and if someone said it they would get downvoted big time nunes is sweet i really like her i dont give a shit about her sexual orientation or looks because i was never going to fuck her anyway and i just like watching fighting
MMA,removed,oh shut the fuck up
MMA,removed,who is the chode in the gray suit who keeps standing in the front talking to other reporters
MMA,removed,her aboxee choachee a tole her she can a boxee with mee
MMA,removed,because it sounds funny asshole
MMA,removed,sakata may have just gotten whupped and embarrassed but at the end of the day hes the one married to
MMA,removed,is it still a nuthugger if its a female fighter that is this guy
MMA,removed,already made one
MMA,removed,one of the worst competitors in mma history she has always been a baby when things dont go exactly her way she never was a good remodel if you ever were a fan of ronda go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,garcia would rape cuckold mcgregor
MMA,removed,ill come all over your face and then eat it bitch
MMA,removed,dat ass tho
MMA,removed,lmaao yess
MMA,removed,if you dont think this is awesome than you should take the stick out of your ass
MMA,removed,like father like daughter ð
MMA,removed,thats super sexist shitlord
MMA,removed,lets disregard the fact that it is an obligation she also said she was going to speak post fight so shes a child and a liar done with you remove yourself from rouseys asshole so you can make a coherent argumemt
MMA,removed,dudes wife is hot
MMA,removed,maybe for a casual dont get me wrong i never pay i just stream but i still like these fights
MMA,removed,all she has to do is rape me now
MMA,removed,lmao nice try bro you are a hypocrit its cool im an asshole i think the no dad shit is low key funny af i have a dad tho
MMA,removed,i was hoping for a quick reply from someone who isnt a smug asshole like yourself but thanks
MMA,removed,bruh fuck off if that chick is im
MMA,removed,til id fuck kid yamamotos older sister sideways twat and all
MMA,removed,i feel the opposite ive always disliked her because of her lack of humility in victory and was jubilant when she got her head kicked off by holmes but the amount of hate she has been getting since is too much for just about anyone to handle kanye west can brush shit like that off but im actually worried about ronda as someone who always wanted to see her lose i hope she disappears and goes into total media blackout starts training hard with a solid camp then in a year or comes back to rape the division
MMA,removed,i was feeling a little down after cody garbrandt is an elite fighter he gave his belt to that kid cruz was still a savage at the post fight ive never seen anyone deal with loss that way thrillashaw aka killashaw aka dillashaw is back and then ronda died we will never see her as a fighter again i like nunes but it still feels tragic in a way what im trying to say is that this is what i need right now i wish rizin had been there for me after weidman vs silva
MMA,removed,says someone whos never stepped in a ring go fuck yourself with a rusty fork
MMA,removed,big mouthed white girl is going to dry her tears with her million while the brown slum monkey is going back into obscurity theres no nunes without rousey no one cared about her before and everybody will be talking about rouseys loss not the spanish rape babys win
MMA,removed,joe warren reminds me of trump sad shit
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,hopefully she actually kills herself this time around
MMA,removed,i have a fearboner for jazzy she actually looks good from certain angles unlike gabi plus dat ass
MMA,removed,why wear that skirt if you didnt want to get raped its rape apologists like you that make me sick get a life pervert ronda deserves better than this
MMA,removed,i would let rena shit in my mouth no joke
MMA,removed,she looks like a hooker with all that make up but she is my pick
MMA,removed,this appears to be much better than that rape they put on that bon jovi song
MMA,removed,i would happily give away a testicle to get ball deep in meisha
MMA,removed,lets go tiny nips
MMA,removed,only logical one hahahhahahahaha ronda mustve lost because of bad knees even though she looked fine when she was on the ground with holly yeah just ignore that not because holly masterfully defended not because nunes rung her bells constantly k edmond
MMA,removed,i uploaded both her fights with holm and nunez to pornhub but they wouldnt accept rape
MMA,removed,meisha take looks disgusting all the people saying how great she looks must be professional dragon slayers
MMA,removed,youre a joke all in all i would bet on rousey i would give floyd a punchers chance but i just dont see him koing ronda in the first exchange ronda doesnt need to get the takedown on the first try she just needs to get a hold of floyd and as soon as the fight hits the mat whether ronda is on top or even just pulls guard it will be her world
MMA,removed,imma fuck you til you love me
MMA,removed,where can i watch the full fights i know it was lived stream
MMA,removed,lol also lol and lol fuck you asshole
MMA,removed,full fight can be found here
MMA,removed,go fuck yourself
MMA,removed,everybody else musters up the strength to say something she is just a fucking asshole with no respect for other people
MMA,removed,id beam into her asshole
MMA,removed,in that picture hes literally grasping his solar plexus hes nowhere near the liver ps dont be a pretentious little asshat either
MMA,removed,did she kill herself yet
MMA,removed,she should just commit suicide now like her worthless dad this waste of life is finished bitch dont even wash her hair
MMA,removed,miesha tate you can have my fat neck beard body
MMA,removed,its an argument because youre dumb
MMA,removed,i just want to see her more in general know what im sayin
MMA,removed,i cant tell if youre just a troll or straight up retarded now
MMA,removed,oh fuck off are you even fucking serious you think the fight shouldve been stopped earlier idiot
MMA,removed,fuck off and dont come back
MMA,removed,hahaha glad she got her ass kicked not a champion
MMA,removed,i trust you havent watched mma or any combat sports very often thats why youre so easily impressed jesus fucking wept youre a bit of a prick arent you are you completely incapable of having a normal discussion without throwing baseless insults not that i need to prove myself to someone whos most likely a year old but ive been watching mma since which in the mcgregorrousey era of fans is a long fucking time and she was winging shots why wouldnt she before this gif starts she hurt her with a crisp she like anyone else in the wbw division has no respect for rondas standup and rightly so so once she saw that ronda was hurt she swung for the fences do you think shes the first mma fighter to ever do that when they smell blood and successfully at that and how can you base your notion of mma going down the pan on a wmma match which is very much in its infancy
MMA,removed,what even is your point i didnt sign a contract to fight i didnt get myself in there in front of millions of people stupid arguement and i think id be ok with eating a few punches from a female
MMA,removed,if hes still alive that is
MMA,removed,thats not how you spell conor or ronda
MMA,removed,im asking you to explain how technique played a roll you no training dip shit you havent given a single detail on how these people win or lose your observations are just vapid grandiose fluff about cans versus top tier athletes and other non descriptive nonsense any minute now im waiting for you to blab on about bullshit like heart and power like i said if ronda fought cans until she met holley your claim then how did meisha beat holly its a simple question to see if you grasp how this shit really works because by your logic that shouldnt have happened since meisha was a tomato
MMA,removed,im bothered by you praised him like a god and dare tell me i dont know shit about fighting only to be completely wrong next time stfu and stop acting like a know it all
MMA,removed,so glad ronda lost first hillary loses in brutal fashion and now ronda again was the best year ever
MMA,removed,helping develop a new martial art is a bit different than fighting a couple white belts from a thousand year old one dont act like a dipshit just for the sake of acting like a dipshit
MMA,removed,lol king of the hill peggy enters boggle contest gets to finals hank discovers illegal boggle bookmaking operation and gets addicted to gambling bets his winnings on peggy to lose in the final even though she is his wife but at least peggy won the tournament unlike ronda i wish miesha tate was still fighting after her recent loss they should set up a rematch if ronda has even a chance of going back into the octagon at the end of the match she should mail me the shorts she was wearing during it i would suck on them like the jelly doughnut stains i sometimes get on my shirt
MMA,removed,lol at mass outrage trump got elected and there wasnt mass outrage people will move on with the ufc and forget by today
MMA,removed,its how you handle yourself in defeat that matters says you fuck off for wanting people to deal with things the way you
MMA,removed,i actually see that as a great service to the world there are just too many damn people
MMA,removed,if bang him
MMA,removed,humbled in a loss oh wait still an asshole
MMA,removed,maybe now all you arm chair psychologists will stfu about how cruz is in his head a lot of you look like fucking idiots for acting so convinced it was making a difference
MMA,removed,big fucking deal yaall act like cody single handedly cured his cancer and donates all his earnings to him or some shit cant believe you eat this good morning america shit up
MMA,removed,no training months and spending thousands on training sparring partners etc then travelling around the world while your opponent humiliates you then he knocks you out in seconds then everyone thinks youre shit thats real humiliation nice try though trying to make this seem worse
MMA,removed,she would have to get past his boxing to be able to throw him or secure an armbar what about the last fights makes you think she would be able to do that
MMA,removed,badass beautiful woman badass dike
MMA,removed,r u telling me rmma circlejerks around certain fighters till their dick falls off
MMA,removed,lol i wish herb would have let it continue until ronda ate a another giant head kick i needed another highlight in my life fuck rousey her stand up is trash shes done trash talking for good
MMA,removed,ronda announces retirement she obviously doesnt have a champions mindset to try and bounce back
MMA,removed,ohh yes because every fighter except for her is clean fuck off
MMA,removed,agreed getting posterized looks bad but everyone knows it was just a single moment of play unless you also happened to lose the game from that dunk in the back of everyones mind they know it doesnt really reflect much on the player getting giffed in the whole fight caught in an embarrassingly short failure all the visual disgrace of being posterized but the added deeper shame of it actually reflecting on you as an athlete
MMA,removed,
MMA,removed,so youre cool with pearl harbor the rape of nanking and edited porn got it
MMA,removed,shes an ugly lesbian who looks like a hood rat
MMA,removed,fuck off with the hate
MMA,removed,hed just fuck her brains out anyway nunes was trying to do her a favour
MMA,removed,i can watch this fight over and over again and only have spent minutes of my time thank god for the free streams
MMA,removed,somebody post stream pls

MMA,removed,sorry but the venezuelan sexy babe is taking the belt from the butch brazilian after she smashes schevshenko
MMA,removed,and making sure his big boob hot dumb slut flatbill girlfriend that hes probably been dating for weeks is in every single embedded episode and saying really dumb things and seeming really unintelligent when he speaks and having a small vocabulary and not being able to think wittingly or quickly when asked simple questions
MMA,removed,she definitely has that i dodid hgh facial features im curious to whether her clit is as big as httpwwwlunaticradiocomrockitchynajpg whatever floats your boat i guess
MMA,removed,fucking lol kind of alpha in a way though
MMA,removed,there are hundreds of threads about conor and you can talk about him in all of those we dont think that every bit of social media conor puts out warrants a post of its own not only because they are of vanishing relevance but also because at a certain point they swamp out the ability of the community to find new content by overwhelming the new submission if the hundreds of posts about conor dont give you enough opportunity to talk about conor this might not be the appropriate venue for the kind of discussion you want to have if you think youre being robbed of your ability to talk about him here please visit rconormcgregor rconormcgregor or make a community of your own all of those options are freely available however what rmma will not do is sacrifice mma discussion for conor discussion

MMA,removed,rmmastreams
MMA,removed,brazilians are so shitty
MMA,removed,wow im really disappointed by the comments in this sub so its ok to objectify an excellent athlete like claudia and make jokes about her personal life this kind of thing might seem like harmless fun but it contributes to rape culture and might distress our female members

MMA,removed,what if i told youi dont believe cyborg was born a femalebut i still want to fuck her
MMA,removed,brazilian sports fans are ungracious rude assholes with no respect for the sport much like their athletes
MMA,removed,cyborg is the ugliest motherfucker ive ever seen straight outta hell

MMA,removed,i just cant believe wandy successfully snuck into the womens division its like juwanna man
MMA,removed,laptop unplugged right before cyborg bell rings frantically plugs it back in and starts laptop gets stream going and fight is over darn it

MMA,removed,httpiimgurcomvlzxhlvgif
MMA,removed,you mean catchsex you cis shitlord
MMA,removed,would love for this tranny bitch to shove her inch clit down my asshole
MMA,removed,palestine is not a state fuck saad awad
MMA,removed,they purposely flopped fake falling or fake injuries to get penaltys called in their favor they really tried to hurt opposing team players they cried and lastly really didnt deserve to be past where they were in the tournement watch some early games versus other teams and its shocking how they even are considered that great
MMA,removed,serious request fuck off
MMA,removed,smh lmao truuu im dead ððððððððððââðð
MMA,removed,you said it like a dickhead but rockhold is clearly the more dominant and wellrounded fighter and will win the rematch with ease
MMA,removed,hey brazil get your shit together you fucking animals
MMA,removed,brazil earths toilet
MMA,removed,wow congrats on winning dollars there bud go back to your cheap ass apartment and thats half the rent ho ho ho good job dollars is chang to me do you understand change

MMA,removed,brazil is a shit hole wouldnt expect anything less
MMA,removed,why wasnt joe rogan commentating last night
MMA,removed,not sure what you are talking about only a total of two posts were removed here in the last hours
MMA,removed,and now youve shown us that youre an asshole
MMA,removed,stop making moronic statements when you speak you are not even making sense
MMA,removed,my first time watching cyborg fight its definitely a man or some malefemale hybrid
MMA,removed,shut the fuck up you fucking rat
MMA,removed,pretty obvious that he wasnt taking stipe seriously werdum will admit he screwed up theyll be a lot less derping during another walkout of his in the future butthurts with zero sense of humor can eat a bag of dicks keep downvoting my previous comment but its still true
MMA,removed,already tired of hearing her bitch she got fucked up so she needs to just shut the fuck up
MMA,not_removed,dan looks like a retired navy seal commander who is called by the us government for one last mission only he can get done
MMA,not_removed,a rematch would be insane lol fuck the rankings lets go
MMA,not_removed,just imagine what a fairy tale ending this would be for dan if he actually gets a shot and manages to win
MMA,not_removed,love dan he should hang it up though
MMA,not_removed,obviously he wants to collect one super fat paycheck before retiring but there is no logical reasoning to make this fight happen i like hendo hes a true pioneer and legend of the sport use to even train at his gym no way does he deserve a shot at the belt yeah its a marketable fight but hes in his ufc return isnt in the top ten he has no wins over the top ten granted he beat bisping events ago it probably wouldnt go his way in a hypothetical rematch with romero out of the picture for now jacare is the primary candidate
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt deserve to fight bisping he can only get that fight if bisping pushes hard for it and then probably wont happen there are current top fighters in line for a shot eg jacare rockhold weidman romero at this point henderson gets put away
MMA,not_removed,read this retarded navy seal commander
MMA,not_removed,this is quite accurate
MMA,not_removed,logical reason the fight would bring in a lot of casual fans with the whole rematch and usa vs brit thing
MMA,not_removed,no logical reason how about money
MMA,not_removed,oh shit you used to train at his gym that must mean youre about to make your real post which is just strung together criticisms
MMA,not_removed,rockhold doesnt deserve fight weidman either because hes a pussy and pulled out of rockhold fight
MMA,not_removed,rockhold would be an instant rematch of a fight that wasnt close no thanks weidman is injured and unavailable otherwise hed be a good choice romero is an asshole cheater coming off a suspension who doesnt deserve it jacare definitely deserves it but it would mean a lot less money for the ufc so if theyre smart theyll give it to hendo
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,ok when was the last time a guy ranked at fought for the belt obviously rankings dont mean as much as they use to but lets me realistic how the fuck are you gonna give hendo whos coming off a win over an unranked fresh of suspension lombard a shot over jacare i understand money creates fights like mcgregor vs diaz however no belt on the line i know ufc loves money but i doubt theyd go as far as giving hendo the next shot at the title when you have other actual top tier contenders all which have a better claim edit i swear this subreddit is one of the worst circle jerks fuck logic right
MMA,not_removed,dude cmon really i only mentioned it cause i wanted to show that i respect hendo but think he doesnt deserve a title shot meaning even though i know hes a cool guy and awesome fighter he shouldnt even be in the talks of a title shot trying to not be biased for fucks sake
MMA,not_removed,jacare
MMA,not_removed,im not arguing with your reasoning but saying there is no logical reason is incorrect money is a logical reason tbh tho im enjoying the entertainment fights more than the belt fights
MMA,not_removed,dude dont even bother if the subject involves benefitting one fighter that people like henderson mcgregor the money argument is a legitimate reason to make it happen for most of these asshats even if it fucks over other athletes and makes the sport less legitimate they will support it solely because they are a fan that individual fighter i swear people will regret supporting these choices when matchmaking in the ufc turns into what boxing is now a bunch of popular fighters and their management searching for the most profitable fights while the rest of the roster is making peanuts and struggling to book fights because they arent marketable to the populace
MMA,not_removed,yep chael sonnnen and his title shots were mostly unwarranted
MMA,not_removed,yeah he deserves most but i want to see hendo
MMA,not_removed,fair enough
MMA,not_removed,you got me there though silva can probably be argued with jones there was absolutely no warrant
MMA,not_removed,and a follow up did you a get really excited and watch anyway or b not watch because hes not next in line its unfair part of the game is the wwe like theatrics we just need to make peace with it and have a little fun not all the time or youll ruin it but gsp vs bisping that would be epic and i would scream like a school girl
MMA,not_removed,of course i got super excited id watch regardless the only thing is this particular time you have jacare whos been shafted quite a bit already and i just want to see him finally get his shot which is pretty deserved granted he lost a split to romero but as things stand he his most deserving atm between the top contenders
MMA,not_removed,i do want to see jacare because he smokes most of the division and is probably the best in the division too i just want bisping vs hendo or gsp like a spoilt child not for any valid reason than pure spectacle and i have made peace with it
MMA,not_removed,in general has been crazy not just in mma but everywhere the end of the world is coming
MMA,not_removed,is this rmma or twitter enough with these garbage posts already
MMA,not_removed,poundforpound best sports journalist we got
MMA,not_removed,vin scully sums it up while calling one of the greatest moments in sports history
MMA,not_removed,in new mma fans find out that anyone can get caught in a fight it just takes one punch to bring the upset i think lawler will be back but not sure if hell get the belt back
MMA,not_removed,mom
MMA,not_removed,kenny florian
MMA,not_removed,butbutariel
MMA,not_removed,man ellenberger put on a hellacious performance seeing him scream in victory after the ref stopped the fight was cool to see back from the deadcareerwise
MMA,not_removed,am i the only one who found rose vs karolina underrated great technical match with some good work from karolina in the clench
MMA,not_removed,americans really get shafted with fight pass ive had for a week already
MMA,not_removed,man i had a bad feeling about the lawler fight i feel bad for whoever fights him next
MMA,not_removed,yeah it was a solid fight my favorite thing about that fight was that kk found just one opening and exploited it relentlessly feels like it took her a little bit to realize where her advantage was and then ruthlessly exploited it for the rest of the fight
MMA,not_removed,yeah i saw uk and ireland have it i guess well trade that for the start time haha
MMA,not_removed,yeah we need to complain until its like that across the board
MMA,not_removed,not really all you need is a vpn and youre good
MMA,not_removed,see this man he is a natural born killer we cannot have this in our country
MMA,not_removed,this is fucking badass imagine a picture of your face being so savage that people literally use it to frighten actual lawmakers
MMA,not_removed,tbf thats a badass pic good choice
MMA,not_removed,that photo isnt especially violent so thats a weird inclusion id imagine he said something like hes too sexy do you want shirtless men like him to turn our impressionable young men gay
MMA,not_removed,unless hes against it because handsome mma fighters keep stealing his wife i really dont get why hes using condit as an example
MMA,not_removed,i hope someone more creative than me will photoshop this picture by the end of the day this is a meme waiting to happen
MMA,not_removed,this minister is right carlos condit is so hot that he should be illegal
MMA,not_removed,his printer is awful im offended at the quality smh
MMA,not_removed,you know you have a bad argument when you have to rely on emotional appeals
MMA,not_removed,as a lebanese i find this so embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i imagine this would just make carlos condit proud to be his example
MMA,not_removed,doesnt look like anything to me
MMA,not_removed,hahaha perfect if anyone deserves to be the face of a stone cold natural born killer it is condit may all unfans fear this man
MMA,not_removed,that pic of carlos condit is my lock screen photo on my ipad
MMA,not_removed,wait till he sees thiago silva
MMA,not_removed,maybe the minister thought that mma gods were insane and cannot be in his country because condit didnt get the wins he deserve got finished quick by maia
MMA,not_removed,the only good thing to come out of lebanon is mia khalifai think and even then that thing is getting ran through like a track
MMA,not_removed,this is meme potential right here
MMA,not_removed,lmao id feel honored if i were condit
MMA,not_removed,streisand effect condit will now be the most popular mma fighter in all of lebanon
MMA,not_removed,isnt lebanon in the middle of the whole war its practically next to isis territory in syria
MMA,not_removed,see this man he only won rounds three and four and got the decision why would we want a sport in our country that cant understand the simple fact of diaz
MMA,not_removed,first off hilarious second is anyone really surprised were talking about a place in the world where you go to jail for using the word god in vain so if you say goddamnit youre fucked and most likely raped or raped and most likely fucked
MMA,not_removed,diaz
MMA,not_removed,this guy hasnt seen bj penn vs joe stevenson
MMA,not_removed,hes covered in blood in that photo hard to see with such bad quality
MMA,not_removed,have they banned boxing show him a picture of vitali klitschko or hassim rahman after some of there fights
MMA,not_removed,someone should object and hold a picture of doo ho choi
MMA,not_removed,im sorry but when was the last time the middle east considered a place of rational thinking
MMA,not_removed,yep dont want to disturb non violent groups like hezbollah in their country
MMA,not_removed,the funny thing is what caused that cut was and elbow from gsp that wasnt even that violently thrown just a smart elbow to cause a bleed
MMA,not_removed,if anything you think they would have used a picture of rorys face after the lawler fight
MMA,not_removed,you know when everyone involved consents to something happening why is there always one dickhead who it doesnt affect in the least complaining
MMA,not_removed,if they could see how stupid they look oo
MMA,not_removed,so random hahaha
MMA,not_removed,looks like hes holding more than one pic i wonder what are the other ones benson henderson with a toothpick
MMA,not_removed,ah yes this is the thing they should be worrying about no other problems present nothing to see here
MMA,not_removed,that has to be a career highlight for him wanna know how bad ass i am policy makers in other countries use a photo of me to scare other policy makers i am the boogey man
MMA,not_removed,i would be scared of carlos as well
MMA,not_removed,lebanese minister and this is the reason i turned gay
MMA,not_removed,that is so weird doesnt desert force hold some of its events out of lebanon hell i seem to remember one of their champions being lebanese welterweight champ
MMA,not_removed,condit is violent as helli would use him to sway people against mma if that were my goal
MMA,not_removed,gotta admit hes making a strong argument
MMA,not_removed,did anyone else notice that the photo hes holding has the blood shopped out of it google bloody condit
MMA,not_removed,like as of lebanon was a mma hot spot to begin with
MMA,not_removed,looks like he never heard of the red king before
MMA,not_removed,carlos condit is one of the few men i would have sexual intercourse with
MMA,not_removed,simply unislamic
MMA,not_removed,can someone put dickbutt on there
MMA,not_removed,hezbollah stands against the violence of mixed martial arts facepalm they have a machine gun on their flag ffs
MMA,not_removed,motherfucking carlos condit fucking it up for all of lebanon
MMA,not_removed,does anyone care enough about lebanon to even care
MMA,not_removed,from ufc josh hedges with the classic pic
MMA,not_removed,no body should be that talented entertaining and brutal yet unlucky
MMA,not_removed,ironically you wont find a better example of a true respectful martial artist in mma than carlos condit
MMA,not_removed,they are scared that he might start throwing spinning shitand justifiably so
MMA,not_removed,see this man he said he goes into a dark place when hes fighting mma is obv for serial killers
MMA,not_removed,should change his nickname to the lebanese boogeyman
MMA,not_removed,carlos the natural born pussy slayer condit
MMA,not_removed,the lighting is obscuring hes probably using
MMA,not_removed,oh god wait til the ol minister busts out a headshot of jouban
MMA,not_removed,the entire decision to ban mma is weird
MMA,not_removed,do you want to have to take your wife out to dinner two maybe three times a week to keep her interested when this is in our country
MMA,not_removed,it was a good enough argument for new york
MMA,not_removed,handsome mma fighters
MMA,not_removed,because in the pic hes bloody
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,dana huf face
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i need one where joe is losing his mind on a podcast
MMA,not_removed,seriously id go gay for this guy
MMA,not_removed,everyone on this subreddit wants to blow condit it seems
MMA,not_removed,you know its politics when you rely on emotionnal appeal
MMA,not_removed,eh a province in canada just banned bjj tournaments france has banned mma and ny just had it legalized its not a lebanese thing there are dumb people everywhere
MMA,not_removed,among other things that embarass me more as a lebanese x
MMA,not_removed,ssup
MMA,not_removed,still hot look at that jawline
MMA,not_removed,we are but not the way you think life is normal here
MMA,not_removed,yeah doublecheck your info there buddy
MMA,not_removed,after seeing someone who calls himself the natural born killer running around and point fighting i might want to ban mma too
MMA,not_removed,the before the islamic clergy rose to political power
MMA,not_removed,yup desert force phoenix fc featured buakaw in decembers event in beirut etc things were starting to pick up here
MMA,not_removed,i do
MMA,not_removed,nobody should also be that good looking
MMA,not_removed,machida
MMA,not_removed,exactly my thoughts highly intelligent and down to earth guy the worst example i actually think he even could be used as a positive example for many other noncombat athletes ps wouldnt war machine brett rogers or at least jbj fit better for justifying mma ban
MMA,not_removed,james toney
MMA,not_removed,platinum
MMA,not_removed,joey coco diaz
MMA,not_removed,carlos wick
MMA,not_removed,thats fucking badass
MMA,not_removed,hair thinning at its best
MMA,not_removed,hes keeping the pictures of jouban and rockhold for his own umpersonal research
MMA,not_removed,condit is way hotter
MMA,not_removed,and northcutt
MMA,not_removed,cant forget elias theodorou
MMA,not_removed,kids got a piece on him
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say its weird just people who dont understand mma and think is just barbaric
MMA,not_removed,dadbod is in nowadays i hear
MMA,not_removed,sploosh
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,hes so hot that its not gay he transcends
MMA,not_removed,id even pay
MMA,not_removed,no homo thou
MMA,not_removed,they didnt ban bjj tournaments they said that since the sport has grown so much in popularity and there is a not insignificant risk of injury a governing body needs to be established for it before more tournaments can take place this may result in the cancellation of one tournament but once the governing body is in place they will continue no one is calling for an end to the violence of bjj in quebec
MMA,not_removed,lol which province was that
MMA,not_removed,amen to that my buddy carlos is a prime example
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,true just a poor choice in hairstyle
MMA,not_removed,law of the penal code states that anyone who uses the name of god in vain will be jailed from a month up to a year i checked my info right before posting that so i wont by no means mislead anyone with false information buddy
MMA,not_removed,all of them
MMA,not_removed,for real tho conduits hot af
MMA,not_removed,unf
MMA,not_removed,nah i hear hes into pee stuff
MMA,not_removed,thats an equal example not necessarily a better one
MMA,not_removed,thought you had respect boi ahhhh
MMA,not_removed,shows you how much they do their research
MMA,not_removed,they call him baba yaga the boogeyman motherfucker do you even speak a slavic language no they call him evil grandmother because he had an awful upbringing
MMA,not_removed,condit has literally some of the most thick hair
MMA,not_removed,its just his sweat and gsp is huge
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats just what fine hair does when its wet
MMA,not_removed,easy on the haterade
MMA,not_removed,butterface
MMA,not_removed,behind the scenes there are of politics that led to this also
MMA,not_removed,thats not dadbod thats i ate your dad bod
MMA,not_removed,dadabod is in nowadays i hear ftfy
MMA,not_removed,good goof shit
MMA,not_removed,oh jesus christ
MMA,not_removed,its been so long since i laughed that laughing feels strange
MMA,not_removed,quebec
MMA,not_removed,in my years of living in lebanon i have never heard of anyone who got locked up for those claims but then again i checked your flair out and it all makes sense now
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,why is this shit still making me laugh
MMA,not_removed,yeah probably just stopped at carloss nickname in their research
MMA,not_removed,goddamn just wanted to point out that its part of my wallpaper and ive been looking at it way too much
MMA,not_removed,buttisface
MMA,not_removed,like what exactly just curious

MMA,not_removed,georges st pierre
MMA,not_removed,joe lauzon
MMA,not_removed,fony elcringey terguson
MMA,not_removed,thought you wouldnt find it funny anymore boiii aaghhhh
MMA,not_removed,whats your wallpaper
MMA,not_removed,hey you leave urijah out of this
MMA,not_removed,mma is getting popular and attracting all the talents leaving martial arts like karate and others to dust also the minister isnt on good terms with the head of the lebanese mma federation who has been removed from his position previously all political parties decided to side with the minister on this one and not make a shitstorm so basically the government screwed its people nothing new in lebanon
MMA,not_removed,someone needs to tell firas and georges to start marketing themselves as qjj quÃ©bÃ©cois jiu jitsu i could see a lot of francs or whatever quebec money is to be made there
MMA,not_removed,doctor lombard
MMA,not_removed,jon jones
MMA,not_removed,interesting thank you
MMA,not_removed,thats very unfortunate i was looking forward to watching a cfc event when i came back to lebanon hope the ban wont deter lebanese fighters from perusing mma
MMA,not_removed,their money is actually called looney toonies good for you in giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming their currency had a sensible sounding name
MMA,not_removed,micheal scott
MMA,not_removed,rousimar palhares
MMA,not_removed,rampage jackson

MMA,not_removed,his trial actually started today
MMA,not_removed,you son of a bitch made me spit out my coffee laughing thank you btw
MMA,not_removed,cm punk
MMA,not_removed,fuck this was going to be my pick
MMA,not_removed,karolina thug rose diaz
MMA,not_removed,joe son
MMA,not_removed,cccccombo breaker
MMA,not_removed,quite a shit clickbait title though
MMA,not_removed,joe lauzon is a great fucking dude serious class act
MMA,not_removed,everyone seemed really positive and cool in that video with interesting points if view except miller who sounded salty as fuck but maybe they posed the question to him differently
MMA,not_removed,jim miller ha
MMA,not_removed,stay salty jim
MMA,not_removed,who the hell is asking demian maia on his opinion as if he isnt going to respect the shit out of everyone if you watch a maia interview with subtitles it just says heavily heschpecting
MMA,not_removed,lol the trickle downers
MMA,not_removed,is life changing money nate can now retire financially stable unlike guys like condit who have to continue fighting because they have made peanuts even though he clearly has no fire or desire to fight anymore hes been fighting for a long time as well
MMA,not_removed,haha i feel like blokes hit the button after the first sentence or something
MMA,not_removed,i dont care that everyones downvoting ill let you know that i laughed at this enjoy your gold you made me laugh im easily entertained
MMA,not_removed,theyre not wrong conor brings more fans i can tell you people i know that wouldnt of paid for a ppv if it was not for mcgreggor theres gotta be of thousands of us by the time hes done many of us will stay for other fighters too
MMA,not_removed,thats like saying buying apple stock early youre a trickle downer
MMA,not_removed,lol you using a term thinking it represents a legitimate economic theory when it has only ever been used as a bullshit political harpoon
MMA,not_removed,condit comes from a welltodo family and has other things outside of fighting that hes working on hed be fine if he walked away today
MMA,not_removed,at least one guy gets it thanks man edit my first gold what do i do now is there hookers and drugs
MMA,not_removed,lol meaning they think theyll eventually see their pay increase because mcgregor is making millions hence the trickle down
MMA,not_removed,nope the guys thinking the big boat lifts all ships is trickle down thinking
MMA,not_removed,pretty sure thats the exact point he was making there champ
MMA,not_removed,legitimately out of curiously how do you know condit was a from a well to do family from some embedded episodes it certainly looks like he lives a very modest life
MMA,not_removed,i remember him talking about coaching after he was done fighting
MMA,not_removed,honestly doesnt really go that far when you factor in all of his expenses especially when you take into account the level hes fighting at and how long hes been in the game
MMA,not_removed,is chump change if you have to retire by age
MMA,not_removed,they will if they have ppv points
MMA,not_removed,exactly a veteran like him headlining a show on tv come on they can do better than that
MMA,not_removed,points are usually reserved for champs and guys already making figures not the little guys
MMA,not_removed,i follow your math i dont see how that proves that condit is going to be financially set for the rest of his life
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor demanding more money is actually really powerful for fighters it sets a bar that other agents for other fighters can use to say hey look my guy sells half as many ppvs as conor why isnt he getting at minimum a quarter to half as much in pay obviously im not a fucking agent so i dont know what negotiating tactics they use but im sure the smart ones with big clients that arent getting paid what they should are already in the ufcs ear with a mouthful of statistics about mcgregor problem is the ufc has a hugggge disparity with fighters who can sell ppv versus who cant they have handful of fighters that are capable of selling ppvs and the rest of the roster have very little sway in a ppv selling more than like buys even dj for example considered by many the fighter struggles to sell payperviews his management literally have leverage with the ufc in fact the ufc probably dont even give him a ppv cut because theirs nothing to give so on one hand he is setting a bar on the other its now the job of a lot of these other fighters to at least start getting halfway as popular as mcgregor has gotten in the course of his career in order to take advantage of the new possible high value contracts they can negotiate for these guys need to start selling more ppvs period mcgregorronda are showing the demand is their if the supply is worthwhile the biggest reason a lot of these guys dont sell ppvs is because they are awful at media and many of them hate itand thats how they treat their media obligations with despise and agony well its not shocking then when fans dont want to watch your interviews follow your social media or tune into all the prefight promotions or buy the ppv you are headlining unless a union forms bottom tier guys will never get anything worthwhile because they have absolutely negotiating powerand to be honest having the minimum pay at is actually pretty good if you win of your first fights you are looking at if you dont win of your first fights than you have no value to the ufc and will probably get cut as far as television revenue goes theirs no point in even talking about it because it will never be on the table unless a union forms so its irrelevant ppv is the only point of discussion when it comes to negotiating pay currently and mcgregor is doing a lot for guys who have an influence on how many ppvs the ufc sells
MMA,not_removed,i dont even watchlisten to podcasts but surely it has to be a very saturated market by now
MMA,not_removed,too many podcasts
MMA,not_removed,maybe im missing it but is there a phone app for podtail mate
MMA,not_removed,everyone and their mother has a podcast these days
MMA,not_removed,its not like one gets in the way of another unless you have too many podcasts that you want to listen to and thats not a bad thing
MMA,not_removed,i drive an hour each way for work a variety of mma podcasts is nice for for folks like me ð
MMA,not_removed,im certainly not complaining im just wondering if its even a remotely profitable business unless youre either already established or are stupidly famous the oversaturation is quite real
MMA,not_removed,yea you right maybe the money is in the sponsorships
MMA,not_removed,ive talked about starting a podcast with my friend its definitely not something wed do for money its just a lowcost thing to do that would be fun and different
MMA,not_removed,podcast networks are probably making a killing
MMA,not_removed,it has never been an avenue that was easy to establish rogan started with nothing and sponsors like fleshlight
MMA,not_removed,people can make donations as well
MMA,not_removed,thats literally the only money in it id imagine its simply a work of passion as opposed to an actual attempt at creating revenue
MMA,not_removed,im excited to see both fights personally not sure why it has to be one or the other
MMA,not_removed,im probably the only one whos the most excited for the reem to come back and fight hunto seems almost forgotten among the two top main events
MMA,not_removed,im just about as excited for both but woodley vs wonderboy has the slight edge
MMA,not_removed,dont talk for me bitch
MMA,not_removed,im slightly more pumped to see fergusonkhabib but woodleythompson should be good too i have a feeling woodley is gonna connect with a wbomb in this time
MMA,not_removed,people are clearly excited to find out who conor will duck first
MMA,not_removed,im actually excited for mark hunt v overeem knock out guaranteed
MMA,not_removed,woodley vs thompson is cool but yeah i am way more interested in khabib vs ferguson
MMA,not_removed,so its clearly lando
MMA,not_removed,khabib vs tony is my current fight of the year
MMA,not_removed,as a maia fan im super invested in the main event if woodley wins i think im gonna cry
MMA,not_removed,khabib vs tony is the peoples main event and thats no disrespect to wonderboy vs woodley that fight is so intriguing just to see how both of them will change their initial gameplans coming into this rematch but imo khabib vs tony is my most anticipated fight of the year behind khabib vs conor
MMA,not_removed,khabib time
MMA,not_removed,yeah lets just be happy that were getting this good of a card
MMA,not_removed,yeah because conor has a history of ducking opponents
MMA,not_removed,too bad i got the sat week after
MMA,not_removed,why
MMA,not_removed,how many title defenses did he have again after being the champ for over a year
MMA,not_removed,gl bro
MMA,not_removed,because woodleys takedown defense is likely to wreck my boys shit up with wonderboy i give maia something like a chance of winning with twood its more like
MMA,not_removed,zero but that wasnt my point are you saying he ducked a guy he beat by rematching the guy he lost to
MMA,not_removed,all im saying is he ducked his division for over a year and i see it much more likely he comes back and fights gsp at than defending his belt against either of them
MMA,not_removed,for whatever reason you arent allowed to have a real conversation about anything involving mcgregor for or against
MMA,not_removed,without the wonderboy in his name it took me a moment to register who he was
MMA,not_removed,mach looks like hes morphing into vovchanchyn in his old age im glad to see him pick up a win
MMA,not_removed,mach looking thick big boy status donkey konged his ass
MMA,not_removed,mirror
MMA,not_removed,mach went so easy on him in the first its like they needed it to be a time filler match and asked him to stretch it out
MMA,not_removed,joesondo a martial art style so dangerous they put the man who invented it prison
MMA,not_removed,hi your submission was removed from rmma because it broke one of our rules your post would be better suited as a comment in a current stickied thread httpswwwredditcomrmmawikirules if you disagree with this decision or if you think we made a mistake please use this link to
MMA,not_removed,obligatory
MMA,not_removed,wow after reading up on him its going to be weird watching austin powers again
MMA,not_removed,damn for only being shes been fighting a long time since i was looking forward to seeing more of her in the ufc given her experience shame that her career is being cut short by a brain abnormality but good on her for not pushing it and knowing when to walk away
MMA,not_removed,damn paddy holohan retired aisling daly retired and the goat cathal pendred retired
MMA,not_removed,wish her all the best
MMA,not_removed,damn first paddy and cathal and now ais the original crop nearly all gone now went in the ufc with also a big win over jessica eye for the naafs flyweight belt back in a very respectable career and a true pioneer of irish mma
MMA,not_removed,these sbg fighters take these blows to the head seriously they wont be struggling to form sentences in years
MMA,not_removed,all the best to her in retirement smart to get out early before any more damage was done she was one of the first crop of mma fighters in ireland and has been competing for a long time all over the world and while she wasnt at the elite level it was an accomplishment to become the countrys first female to fight and win in the ufc before she was done and she had a long road to get there at least she was able to go out with a win at home best of luck to her in whatever she does next i assume shell stay in and around the sport as shes heavily involved in getting mma better regulated in ireland and making it safer for fighters at all levels
MMA,not_removed,with your bombs and your guns
MMA,not_removed,sbg dropping like flies pendred opened a salad bar daly with the brain injury hoolihan with blood disorder mcgregor back when we dont know ward looked shockingly out of his depth nelson not fought in forever
MMA,not_removed,we all know that artem managed to hurt ishihara with a standing hammerfist but dont forget where he got it from
MMA,not_removed,hate to see anyones career cut short but she is doing the right thing all the best in retirement
MMA,not_removed,can an irish person tell me how to pronounce her name commentators always kinda mumbled through it and i think im right in thinking its one of those weird spelling jobs like niamh or siobhan
MMA,not_removed,heart for days but not a winner of the genetic lottery probably the worst athlete in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,thats some scary shit glad they caught it before she fought again maybe it was a blessing she got injured and had to pull out of the fight with michelle waterson if michelle had hit aisling with one of those spinning head kicks shes knocked people out with in practice not a fun thought
MMA,not_removed,irelands first female bjj black belt too an incredible pioneer of the sport
MMA,not_removed,im sorry but is that the best photo she could find best of luck in her future endeavors
MMA,not_removed,thanks for everything ais
MMA,not_removed,any idea what she might be doing next i always wonder what these fighters do when they retire in particular fighters like aisling who never made a ton of money
MMA,not_removed,she was a big part of a groundbreaking team good on them for looking out respect to sbg for truly looking out
MMA,not_removed,man i will never understand what possesses people to do so many hash tags thequeenofirishmma aisthefirst sbg sbgswords sbgireland happy proud grateful mma ufc retirement worldchampion blackbelt legend safemma immaf fightersafety wmma fmma
MMA,not_removed,all the best to her good call to retire
MMA,not_removed,very wise decision gotta respect that wish her all the best
MMA,not_removed,i met aisling when she came to cleveland to fight jessica eye for the naafs womens title she came into jesss home town and people treated her like shit and she took it all with class when i met her she was very nice and polite good luck aisling
MMA,not_removed,ais is definitely one of the good guys gutted for her
MMA,not_removed,nobody can take that left hand
MMA,not_removed,next its gunnar and finally mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,probably for the best she sucked
MMA,not_removed,mehh she was god awful people on this sub only like her because shes in the same gym as conor
MMA,not_removed,who
MMA,not_removed,remember when ireland was the next big nation in mma edit why so many downvotes ive trained at sbg myself and love the place but when they all came on to the scene back in the buzz was ireland was going to take over only conor and duffy left really neil has one last fight
MMA,not_removed,she wont be missed
MMA,not_removed,who the fook is that
MMA,not_removed,women dont hit hard enough to cause brain damage dont know why shes so worried
MMA,not_removed,who
MMA,not_removed,i didnt know she started
MMA,not_removed,who da fook
MMA,not_removed,she wasnt any good anyway
MMA,not_removed,doesnt sound like a long time then i realised thats a decade
MMA,not_removed,how tf can you look forward to soccer mom fights
MMA,not_removed,and also seery retiring soon
MMA,not_removed,if only there was another talented irish mma fighter to take their places
MMA,not_removed,and joe duffy not being given a new contract
MMA,not_removed,when did paddy retire o
MMA,not_removed,neil seerys about to call it quits
MMA,not_removed,irishedmund
MMA,not_removed,thanks for posting this i had never seen this before and this is so awesome the whole audience singing along and singing in your head at that at an mma match was super cool aaand shes in her hometown the bands irish wow chills
MMA,not_removed,phenomenal
MMA,not_removed,fuckthat was chilling they already sucked away alot of the individuality and flair from fighters really hope they leave walkout songs the fuck alone
MMA,not_removed,i was there for that unreal
MMA,not_removed,gotta love the irish fans
MMA,not_removed,probably the greatest entrance in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,it was truly iconic for irish mma
MMA,not_removed,its like she knew where the problem was in your head ill leave
MMA,not_removed,goosesbumps deluxe
MMA,not_removed,holy fuck imagine being her opponent and having to wait in the octagon through all that
MMA,not_removed,kz needs to walkout to this
MMA,not_removed,epic
MMA,not_removed,as it should be i wish the woman well in whatever she does next
MMA,not_removed,we have to have a scan before we fight now im honestly dreading seeing the results
MMA,not_removed,thats what actual welfare will do for ye
MMA,not_removed,i mean she wouldnt be medically cleared to compete so i think everyone would take it seriously
MMA,not_removed,that salad bar is unreal in fairness
MMA,not_removed,yeah alot of the older guys are gone but there are a younger crop coming up probably a bit of a transitional period before some of those are ufc ready
MMA,not_removed,pendreds salad bar is probably raking in cash for him growing in popularity big time over here
MMA,not_removed,also pendred is taking hollywood by storm after recent roles on baywatch and ray donovan hes currently filming with jcvd
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor may retire if he gets the floyd fight shit day for irish mma then just left with the american joe duffy seery whos fights never seem to happen artem who although has got good heart just isnt good enough imo
MMA,not_removed,so what youre saying is that lobov is the great irish hope
MMA,not_removed,its pronounced ashling
MMA,not_removed,im not irish but i think its pronounced ashlyn
MMA,not_removed,bethe
MMA,not_removed,roxanne modaferri
MMA,not_removed,lol if serious question its a good idea to use as many hashtags as you possibly can as these are usually used as searchable keywords in the platform thus increasing your chance at visibilityviews unhashtagged captions are essentially useless if your goal is to reach as many people as possible in the platform beyond your own accounts followers
MMA,not_removed,sometimestofeelahumanemotioniliketodrinkmyownhair
MMA,not_removed,she was in the ufc so she clearly belonged its just a lot of the female fighters are bad
MMA,not_removed,aisling daly
MMA,not_removed,no
MMA,not_removed,dillon danis
MMA,not_removed,rcringe
MMA,not_removed,lol you have to be trolling
MMA,not_removed,ironic that shes a teammate of conor
MMA,not_removed,were all getting old
MMA,not_removed,doesnt sound like a long time my god man thats over twothousand years
MMA,not_removed,the notorious j o e d u f f y
MMA,not_removed,there is alot of up and coming irish mma fighters that arent ufc caliber yet
MMA,not_removed,james gallagher seems to be the next hope
MMA,not_removed,marcus davis
MMA,not_removed,hes fighting soon
MMA,not_removed,couple months ago
MMA,not_removed,if youd actually heard kavanagh talk youd realise what a stupid statement that is to make the man is one of the most knowledgable coaches ive listened to he knows the game inside out
MMA,not_removed,irish edmunds student kod your boy in record time
MMA,not_removed,turteen seconds
MMA,not_removed,no thats aj styles
MMA,not_removed,same and her walkout then performance was probably my favourite moment in a decade of being mma fan everyone steaming and belting it out was amazing sad that it was both aisling and paddys last fights that night
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,lets be real
MMA,not_removed,grow up
MMA,not_removed,what if i told you he used this walkout music before daly
MMA,not_removed,he will but hes not irish so dont expect this
MMA,not_removed,i see her on public transport sometimes with dylan tuke on the way to sbg im sure she will stay active in there in some shape or form too
MMA,not_removed,are u part of sbg
MMA,not_removed,your government decided that
MMA,not_removed,chopped has been popular with a good few years now in dublin
MMA,not_removed,its trendy now lots of these types of businesses are fads mind as popular as clean eating is
MMA,not_removed,haha yeahand he got injured once and his dad has been saying he should be ok to fight around end of marchapril
MMA,not_removed,taking hollywood by storm seems an exaggeration not to belittle it but hes barely past an extra in those roles
MMA,not_removed,american joe duffy welsh
MMA,not_removed,nope its pronounced ashling
MMA,not_removed,you leave bethe out of this
MMA,not_removed,definitely a better athlete than daly more physically strong
MMA,not_removed,heyyy relax
MMA,not_removed,roy nelson
MMA,not_removed,id deleted her from my memory i think youve picked the winner
MMA,not_removed,oh poor little roxanne she
MMA,not_removed,a turd in the toilet among other turds is still a turd
MMA,not_removed,who the are you
MMA,not_removed,it is all of conors teammates are bums
MMA,not_removed,i was only holy shit
MMA,not_removed,wonder if people ever call him up to tell him about their problems with urban housing development
MMA,not_removed,the canadian joe duffy
MMA,not_removed,before him it was cian cowley but then he got rekt so gallagher is the replacement hope lol
MMA,not_removed,hes not even as irish as cain velasquez is mexican plus hes retired
MMA,not_removed,his last fight before hes out of contractgoing to test being a free agent and see if he gets better offers from other organisations
MMA,not_removed,says the guy with a john cena flair beat up john cena
MMA,not_removed,i thought it was pretty funny man i gave you an upvote
MMA,not_removed,a sea of green descended into our camp singing let them schoolgirls go free let them schoolgirls go free la la la la hey la la la la said kevin boko former member of boko haram
MMA,not_removed,rofl
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,whatever happened with those girls
MMA,not_removed,i dont know man that entrance in dublin with everybody singing along to the cranberries still gives me chills
MMA,not_removed,out of curiosity what is your favourite entrance
MMA,not_removed,i cant because the english starved me to death as a child
MMA,not_removed,shit ive seen all his fights several times and i dont even remember
MMA,not_removed,yeah i trained in the affiliate in the city center for more than years and moved to hq nearly years ago i think
MMA,not_removed,that too its there for mma i believe sbg require it now for kickboxing and thai boxing as well
MMA,not_removed,quid ish for a decent sized salad or wrap thats not bad really no skimping on the chicken either with then
MMA,not_removed,youd never make weight wearing that yoke
MMA,not_removed,i guess i should have put a s at the end there i thought it was obvious jokes aside hes doing relatively alright for himself even if they are bit parts hes a smart guy who seems to always have something going on
MMA,not_removed,taking hollywood by poor weather front
MMA,not_removed,referring to him training at tristar even tho thats in canada lol only having a joke if he wishes to better his career and feels he can do that by training in america then good for him just wish we could breed some top level fighters and train them here to continue success as the camps get more experienced born irish raised in wales trains in canada some man joe
MMA,not_removed,bethe is a sloppy brawler at least daly is a good grappler
MMA,not_removed,just a jacked japanese girl deal with it
MMA,not_removed,he may be fat but hes got unnatural power
MMA,not_removed,just because roy is fat doesnt mean he isnt an athlete hes leaps and bounds ahead of bethe or aisling
MMA,not_removed,i would say he has great genetics just poor workeating habits how many fat people do you see in the ufc he moves well for a heavy guy who looks out of shape and he has a killer right hand
MMA,not_removed,if anything nelsons pretty impressive in that regard hes hardly a diaz brother but he does better than youd think given that big ol greasy cheeseburger gut
MMA,not_removed,i dont think thats to do with genetics
MMA,not_removed,sure and wmma is like turds
MMA,not_removed,rdoublecringe
MMA,not_removed,ikr me too wtf actually i was going on
MMA,not_removed,it was a joke he took a lot of flack for trying to be the irish fighter back in the day
MMA,not_removed,he wont
MMA,not_removed,aw you shouldnt be getting downvoted i was at like when you commented
MMA,not_removed,i think they are still being searched for but a small amount of them were found im not sure though and i might be wrong
MMA,not_removed,if theyre not irish then they may not understand the significance of songs like zombie or foggy dew
MMA,not_removed,with the context and everything what a moment
MMA,not_removed,just wait for conor to walk out with the foggy dew playing in croke park
MMA,not_removed,god that entire card was amazing my favorite ufc in terms of crowd ever
MMA,not_removed,id have to sit down and think about it but off the top of my head i really liked mcgregors first one against diaz
MMA,not_removed,if you rewatched them on fight pass they would have dubbed it out on the single fight videos that wouldnt help
MMA,not_removed,that song is quite symbolic here in ireland
MMA,not_removed,its a protest song about the troubles in northern ireland it means a hell of a lot more to daly than it does to kz
MMA,not_removed,cranberries are from limerick shom
MMA,not_removed,getting into hollywood isnt easy any part is worth a lot when youre at that level so more power to him
MMA,not_removed,there is no exaggeration here unfortunately ive seen people argue about mcgregors game of thrones acting that never happened
MMA,not_removed,thats years more training and nothing to do with athleticism
MMA,not_removed,sounds like the tagline to a shitty action movie
MMA,not_removed,i dont think ive ever seen roy leaping and bounding
MMA,not_removed,i would argue that the diazs arent particular gifted athletes either they are sloppy bodied slow and very lanky their cardio however is out of this world although thats something theyve worked at
MMA,not_removed,careful the pc police are on the way to reeducate you about how ronda could outbox mayweather
MMA,not_removed,yep the irish hand grenade as i recall or was it the irish handmaiden or maybe the irish hand job
MMA,not_removed,he could make more money per fight in the european regionals when factoring in sponsorships ufc being dumbass cheapskates
MMA,not_removed,could you please explain
MMA,not_removed,gotta love all the generic rock music on ufc fightpass on the bright side boring bands now have something to shoot for
MMA,not_removed,plus in hollywood you need experience the more experience you get the bigger the role nothing wrong with having to start at the bottom
MMA,not_removed,you cant exaggerate something that isnt real
MMA,not_removed,widerman
MMA,not_removed,two fat brothers with unnatural power
MMA,not_removed,rob schneider is
MMA,not_removed,the first thing i thought of was httpsenwikipediaorgwikimitchellfilm joe don baker was also the thespian powerhouse cast in the original walking tall movies
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,he also fights at heavyweight not bantamweight
MMA,not_removed,its the cardio i was referring to anyone regularly running triathlons and iron man races is an elite level athlete in my book
MMA,not_removed,yeah because thats the general consensus in this sub
MMA,not_removed,long story but basically tied to the irish rebellion against the english that had invaded ireland
MMA,not_removed,songs about ira related loss of life
MMA,not_removed,unless you put the little s at the end nobody will understand your sarcasm attempt
MMA,not_removed,lets get back to the brothers because they gotta strong bond you dont wanna know about it here but the moon it comes crashing into earth and what do you do then
MMA,not_removed,oh man definitely gonna watch the mystery science theater version
MMA,not_removed,oh good lord that was beautiful
MMA,not_removed,what did i just see im sitting here laughing my ass off then i click on this link and it gets damn serious
MMA,not_removed,its hilarious
MMA,not_removed,nah zombie was about a specific incident zombie was written during the cranberries english tour in in memory of two boys jonathan ball and tim parry who were killed in an ira bombing in warrington
MMA,not_removed,the easter rising was irb and ica which pretty much came to form the ira with a bunch of other republican groups if i remember correctly the easter rising happened the same year as the formation of the ira zombie is in response to the ira bombing in cheshire in according to the vocalist dolores oriordan
MMA,not_removed,yeah sure its in the lyrics its the same old theme since in your head theyre still fighting
MMA,not_removed,agreeing like you said one event might have inspired it but the song clearly refers to the conflict in general
MMA,not_removed,oh man i hope its robbie lawler
MMA,not_removed,its i think itll be lawler or brown he said its his fiancegfs favorite fighter so if anyone knows that
MMA,not_removed,a fight against khabib in russia would be pretty wild if hed drop to the two seem to legitimately dislike each other
MMA,not_removed,maybe tim means
MMA,not_removed,considering gsp is going on tomorrows episode of ufc tonight im hoping he announces a fight with cerrone joes reaction on the podcast makes me all tingly in my jiblets
MMA,not_removed,he just said that its a fighter that he cares about and is his ladys second favourite fighter i dont know enough about him but im sure someone else will know more lawler is the fight i would love to see
MMA,not_removed,cerrone vs lawler or cerrone vs gsp
MMA,not_removed,eddie alvarez
MMA,not_removed,joes reaction screams robbie lawler
MMA,not_removed,nick diaz comes to mind
MMA,not_removed,khabib does need to get fedbut i think khabib needs to wait for his title shot
MMA,not_removed,has to be lawler dont know if he has a relationship with cerrone but looking at these two tanned up baldheads it has to be lawler who falls in cerrones gfs taste
MMA,not_removed,yeah im hoping theyll just keep drinking an let it slip lol
MMA,not_removed,id love to see him get it too but conor and nate complicate things he might not get it for a while
MMA,not_removed,dont hold your breath tj
MMA,not_removed,tj just needs to challenge dom to a hair vs hair bet a la gall and northcutt
MMA,not_removed,what a weird picture lol
MMA,not_removed,thats one weird fucked up picture lmao
MMA,not_removed,tj kept headhunting that night with that head kick
MMA,not_removed,if tj would have kept with the leg kick he would have won to me he did regardless but i dont like how cruz fights its supposed to be a fight not a slipping contest
MMA,not_removed,id rather see cody vs cruz right now to be honest
MMA,not_removed,i generally dislike tj for a whole host of different reasons but i kinda like this bet bullshit its fun and i think cruz does need to respond to it
MMA,not_removed,title shot for
MMA,not_removed,i would question if tj would give dom if the situation is same as last fight a very questionable decision i know tj feels he won that fight so in that situation would he give up the money i dont think so id draw up the contract if i were dom
MMA,not_removed,respect to tj for trying to gather interest in a rematch in a way thats different and isnt corny but hes gonna have to wait for his shot and in the meantime he should fight faber
MMA,not_removed,cruz is going to defeat cody and then retire
MMA,not_removed,i dont see why cruz should even dignify it with a response
MMA,not_removed,i shat brix when i saw it
MMA,not_removed,probably because its only a
MMA,not_removed,tj should be thankful dom isnt taking this bet i get you want to get your rematch but lets not put up your purse tj should get the ufc to give him a fight where hes heavily favored someone like caraway
MMA,not_removed,is it just me or does anyone else think saying i know youre scared to the guy that beat you is a little silly
MMA,not_removed,dominick cruz made against faber isnt that enticing tj but im glad hes finally willing to talk shit
MMA,not_removed,uhok
MMA,not_removed,thats a trippy pic
MMA,not_removed,i want someone to edit the pic to where he has armfeet on each side ultimate goro from mortal kombat
MMA,not_removed,fuckin goro
MMA,not_removed,actually id prefer if he did
MMA,not_removed,this is probably why there wasnt a response
MMA,not_removed,i have absolutely no reason for feeling this way outside of thinking its too soon for cody to get a shot but id rather see tj and cody tj absolutely deserves a shot again after such a good close fight makes zero sense in my head but i just cant hype myself up to get behind a rematch just yet
MMA,not_removed,thing is it is his turn in line its only that garbrandt might probably leap frog him because of the interest he garnered also why in the world would he fight faber makes zero sense rankings wise unless you wanna see faber get beat to shit
MMA,not_removed,his shot should have come after arguably beating cruz the first time then after that he beat assuncao arguably the best fighter in that division
MMA,not_removed,i think cruz wants a money fight before he hangs the gloves up for good
MMA,not_removed,i have you res tagged as ill eat my own shit of mcgregordiaz goes to a decision so did that even happen or what
MMA,not_removed,in most cases sure in this case not exactly i mean it could be argued either way as to who won the fight but youd be hardpressed to say that it wasnt one of the closest round fights on record so if you look at it from tjs perspective he feels that he won the fight and that cruz is now scared to rematch because the risk of losing and tarnishing his career is higher than with most other opponents in the division also its worth noting that tj was having a lot more success in the later rounds of the fight he was really starting to kick the snot out of cruzs legs and hamper mobility this led to cruz getting punched more consistently by tj i guess what im saying is that tj may have figured dom out in the end there but just didnt have enough time to make it count as much as it could if he were to have his rematch i am a firm believer that if tj were to approach the next fight tactically and without the angry emotions that led to his early headhunting in their first bout while starting off straight away with leg kicks and body shots then hed have the edge against cruz
MMA,not_removed,yea but its in the least creative most i just learned how to talk some kind of shit age way possible the ol i bet i winooooh you too scared to bet sissyyy move
MMA,not_removed,okay cool not just me i was also bit baffled
MMA,not_removed,looks like a machamp amputee
MMA,not_removed,nah man cant you see that hes too busy spewing more of it out of his mouth no time to put any back in
MMA,not_removed,ranking dont matter much but there still has to be some reason it could potentially headline a fight night card but faber is coming off getting dominated by jimmie rivera who was probably at the time tj is the number contender and just beat the the matchup is just so nonsensical and i dont think event he ufc hype machine could convince fans that faber stands a chance
MMA,not_removed,because the contender is coming off a series of consecutive kos and has a lot of hype behind him i dont see how you can have a guy coming off a loss and and feed him to someone ranked spots ahead of him
MMA,not_removed,the fight would not be competitive tj would without a doubt in my mind finish faber
MMA,not_removed,not only did dennis bermudez survive this knockdown but he gutted it out and wound up winning this was a top fight for incredible match
MMA,not_removed,i saw this fight live random people in the crowd were hugging each other both guys left everything they had in the cage that night hespect
MMA,not_removed,i read this as hilarious knockdown and was gonna make some smart comment like yea he lost so many brain cells so quick that was so funny but then i read the title again im glad i caught myself or else i wouldve looked like a huge asshole
MMA,not_removed,man hows grice holding up these days such a tragedy what happened to him following this fight
MMA,not_removed,he fell like a shower curtain when i falls off the rail
MMA,not_removed,what happened
MMA,not_removed,dude got rear ended by a car going mph on his bike they had to remove half his brain and shit to control the swelling and shit dudes alright for the most part now hes still training but retired now as hes obviously not going to be cleared to fight httpwwwufccomnewsformerufcsuperstarmattgricewinsfightafterlifechangingaccidentid
MMA,not_removed,omg that is horrific glad hes made such a recovery though
MMA,not_removed,if he wins the ufc gold then hell have that belt along with the strikeforce dream and titles true legend of combat sports
MMA,not_removed,crazy how much he looks like his demolition man days again rip ubereem the worlds horses can sleep easy with you gone
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i believe overeem can defeat stipe
MMA,not_removed,not the exact quote but the jist of it hes counting guys he beat before they were ufc champion too but its still impressive for anyone wondering werdum jds arlovski mir lesnar vitor belfort
MMA,not_removed,reem is love reem is life
MMA,not_removed,reems highlight video is so hard to watch spectacular it is but i wince even have to look away at some of those lethal strikes especially the knees he is scary
MMA,not_removed,i dont know if cleveland can handle a loss from stipe so soon
MMA,not_removed,alistairs defense has improve significantly in the past few years hes much more patient stipe is a monster great boxing and good wrestling he almost never kicks though and that is a huge disadvantage overeem will strike in kicking range the entire fight taking stipe out of his comfort zone picking overeem by late tko
MMA,not_removed,the horse meat helped a bit
MMA,not_removed,but he did fight badr hari second time and lost in round like badr hari promised that is one of the best clip of all time
MMA,not_removed,stipe wins by ko in the
MMA,not_removed,i still fondly remember when chuck beat the piss outta him and kharitonov kod him through the ropes after overeem started running away from him and cant forget when badr hari took revenge for his ko loss you beat an old peter aerts reem i wouldve liked to see you fight him in his prime
MMA,not_removed,beaten many tests too
MMA,not_removed,nah stipe all day all day everyday
MMA,not_removed,doesnt it bother people that most of his accomplishments were done when he was juiced to the tits
MMA,not_removed,i think stipe kos him round
MMA,not_removed,alistair is not champ caliber he does not have good boxing and has awful cardio post usada his steroid advantage is gone too all he has is a knee
MMA,not_removed,why are known cheaters still being adored around here mindboggling really i mean any victory a cheater has cannot be taken seriously
MMA,not_removed,thats an achievement i hope he wins overeem is a cool dude
MMA,not_removed,hell be the hw goat
MMA,not_removed,hes gonna get arrested for stalking hendo after the police catch him hiding out on dans roof waiting for dan to go train so he can
MMA,not_removed,it was such a weird stretch of fights where overeem got finished by bigfoot silva travis browne and ben rothwell people knew not to count him out which was part of what made it so frustrating for him to be losing to these guys but now if he wins the belt hes gonna be up there with the greatest heavyweights of all time
MMA,not_removed,i want to get off the reems wild ride
MMA,not_removed,horse lmao
MMA,not_removed,in a more recent video i think it was in one of the reem documentaries alistair went and revisited this guy the guy was shocked but he definitely toned down his reaction probably because of this clip
MMA,not_removed,this is my favorite non fight mma vid
MMA,not_removed,overeem should win but he has a history of losing spectacularly to guys he should beat
MMA,not_removed,he definaitly can but stipe can definaitly beat overeem its heavyweights
MMA,not_removed,alistair fought belfort how have i not seen this
MMA,not_removed,belfort use to fight hw god bless
MMA,not_removed,whats the subreddit name of overeem standing next to things
MMA,not_removed,honestly id be devastated its so cool having multiple champions in the city especially with one of those being a down to earth guy who gives his all for us
MMA,not_removed,you clearly dont follow the nba
MMA,not_removed,not a fan eh
MMA,not_removed,do you really believe the other fighters werent seems obvious to me they were all on peds at least until usada and with all i mean like of all professional mmafighters i mean come on if you had to get in a cage with a roided up overeem or hendo or wanderlei or whoever you gonna stay natty because of principles really anyone who wasnt juicing wasnt ranked very high i dont think the handicap is just too big
MMA,not_removed,theres more people who usehave used peds than ones who have not vitor belfort josh barnett brock lesnar rmmas beloved ben rothwell roidwell big foot silva dan henderson wanderlei silva gilbert melendez bob sapp jake shields thiago alves frank mir etc list just goes on and on and on and on and thats only the ones who have failed tests not the ones who have been rumored to be ped users like woodley rumble hendricks etc if anderson silva viagra my ass can still be cheered on and seen as one of the greatest of all time if not the greatest then overeem shouldnt get that much flak and overeem gets the most hate because he looked the best physically compared to others while being on the horse meat diet the others never looked as good as he did with the exception of woodley and lesnar
MMA,not_removed,no because that was only part of his career and most people were juicing in other organizations
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnqhhyhkcebo
MMA,not_removed,i remember when overeem was human size back in pride i dont find myself that interested in his accomplishments given the juicing but the power of the fight fan is that you dont have to support the fighters you have an issue with
MMA,not_removed,champion strikeforce champion dream champion and beaten previous champs plus youre forgetting that everyone is on steroids
MMA,not_removed,the guy literally has striking
MMA,not_removed,i view things through the lens of pre and a post usada ufc world and i think most other longtime mma fans do the same those that cheated preusada are generally absolved of their guilt as ped use was so widespread those that cheat now are treated with disdain because they are going against a movement to limit the influence of peds in the sport and they are viewed as idiots as usada is viewed as the best that it gets and the penalties for doping are so much more severe is that fair probably not but it is what it is
MMA,not_removed,i know i dont get it at all they will all say everyone cheats even though its impossible to know that
MMA,not_removed,skinny reem putting guys in guillotines in the mw tourney was fantastic
MMA,not_removed,if he hadnt run into peak rua in he would have that version of rua was an absolute monster he wasnt just winning fights he was destroying great fighters
MMA,not_removed,hes a cheat those titles dont mean shit
MMA,not_removed,when werdum comes back to fight for the title it will truly be a test to see who is the greatest heavyweight of all time
MMA,not_removed,that will always be fedor but reem definitely has a shot at
MMA,not_removed,thats fedor he started in a deep hw division and pride had the best at that time its going to be hard to top him because of how difficult it is to hold onto that hw belt for any significant period of time for me that was the bat shit insane part of fedors run and its what continues to give him an edge in a division where one mistake can end your night he always managed to pull out a victory for a ludicrous amount of time the striking display he put on in the fight against cro cop and the fact that he was a multiple time world sambo champion definitely puts him up there skill wise too people are way too damn jumpy when talking about the hw goat let someone actually defend their belt a decent number of times before even bringing it up
MMA,not_removed,he was absolutely beating the shit out of all those guys right up until he got kod as well making it even more frustrating he was the better fighter but kept finding ways to lose
MMA,not_removed,no he didnt got a link i dont remember seeing this or are you trolling lol
MMA,not_removed,i wont believe you until you show me
MMA,not_removed,so true i think it gets past the that the fight really favors stipe he has great endurance for a hw
MMA,not_removed,twice actually
MMA,not_removed,string bean pre ubereem
MMA,not_removed,pride breh pride
MMA,not_removed,lhw the crazier thing is that overeem used to fight lhw
MMA,not_removed,he was for ufc and for ufc he looked er a little different back then
MMA,not_removed,rnexttoovereem
MMA,not_removed,rreemmemes
MMA,not_removed,rnexttonorthcutt
MMA,not_removed,yeah my best friend is a die hard cleveland fan his loyalty is undeniable lol
MMA,not_removed,by part of his career you mean up until like a year ago
MMA,not_removed,the lance armstrong defence
MMA,not_removed,everyone is on roids source
MMA,not_removed,he put together a couple wins in but he does not have good boxing
MMA,not_removed,i would probably lose it if he tapped out stipe with a guillotine
MMA,not_removed,back when shogun was known for his endless gas tank
MMA,not_removed,because everyone else was clean huh
MMA,not_removed,all that salt cant be good for your health homie your nacl levels are over
MMA,not_removed,he got to the pride middleweight grand prix semis before shogun broke him id call it relatively close but my comment was more along the lines of that during his pride run he never managed to get a pride title at all pride was one of the biggest mma promotions ever and having a belt there wouldve been sweeter
MMA,not_removed,cain v overeem will be a huge legacy fight and im sure it will happen should overeem win at
MMA,not_removed,got to be fedor he had a fight unbeaten streak against some of the best heavyweights in the world at the time also his only loss up to that point was a doctor stoppage around seconds into a fight so he wasnt really beaten until his pro fight no other heavyweight has come close to that
MMA,not_removed,its crazy that with all their fights over the years that fedor and overeem never fought one another
MMA,not_removed,although fedor is my all time favorite fighters there is an argument to be had reem transcended generations better hes done it across more years and organizations than fedor did granted reem never did get the pride belts
MMA,not_removed,about half of his losses were in lhw
MMA,not_removed,nah
MMA,not_removed,he can definitely beat stipe if he fights smart no plodding forward keeps his hands up and picks his shots reem is one of my favorite fighters and watching him lose to browne and bigfoot was just maddening however stipe also has a good chance of landing a flash ko so this should be an exciting one
MMA,not_removed,no he definitely did maybe it wasnt in the reem but i remember chuckling when i saw it its out there somewhere but i couldnt find it the last time i tried searching for it
MMA,not_removed,he has to be lying
MMA,not_removed,and shogun kod him twice
MMA,not_removed,shogun ko was brutal
MMA,not_removed,haha no known weaknesses
MMA,not_removed,always amazed seeing him back then i think his mother wouldnt even recognize him
MMA,not_removed,vitor double wide belfort
MMA,not_removed,no known weaknesses
MMA,not_removed,you son of a bitch
MMA,not_removed,theres something about this place that makes me go this is a piece of shit but its my piece of shit
MMA,not_removed,overeem went against brock roughly years ago
MMA,not_removed,he fought almost fights at light heavyweight so no just part of his career
MMA,not_removed,its kind of a meme on rmma since the diaz bros said it i was mostly joking
MMA,not_removed,it depends on what youre looking for in goat criteria fedors skill level is goat fedor would dominate today with his limitless gas tank hand fighting active guard and polished by hw standards striking his resume is pretty weak though he only beat a handful of top talents in crocop nog arlovski and schilt you could argue timmay was a top talent at the time they fought i suppose
MMA,not_removed,the whole point of the sf hw tournament was for them to fight
MMA,not_removed,he wasnt that great in tbh he had a fucking dream run of opponents he destroyed tyrone spong then faced saki with an injured arm from the previous round then beat peter aerts after aerts fought an absolute war with semmi schilt the first loss schilt had ever taken in a gp its still a huge accomplishment but as far as runs go he had a dream run
MMA,not_removed,lol bro reread your sentence that implies that the other half of his losses were not at lhw meaning half of them were at hw
MMA,not_removed,maybe you had a dreem
MMA,not_removed,pride shogun was a weapon of mass destruction
MMA,not_removed,so did liddell once
MMA,not_removed,the khaitonov and liddell ko losses were my favorite to watch
MMA,not_removed,i second this
MMA,not_removed,lol i try to convince him to jump ship from the browns around this time every year tbh hahaha
MMA,not_removed,youre using physical appearances as an indicator josh barnett never looked like a bodybuilder that overeem did but failed multiple times and heck he brought down a whole mma promotion essentially with doing so
MMA,not_removed,except that was a tournament so winning it would give you a title the grand prix title so he was relatively close to it unlike diego unlike ufc without tournaments and my point was that he saw success in the other organizations and pride to a certain degree but never reached that title level
MMA,not_removed,he looked completely outclassed by hari in their rematch in the gp semifinals wouldve love to seen him deal with schilt thats a tall glass of fuck all that noise
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i see what you did there
MMA,not_removed,indeed shoguns only loss in pride was from breaking his arm getting taken down had a good years of being the main man until jones came along imo
MMA,not_removed,kharitonov vs overeem are both amazing shame there was never a trilogy
MMA,not_removed,spinning shit cain isnt even his final form
MMA,not_removed,dont forget that forrest griffin was the one who stopped the train
MMA,not_removed,and that broken arm loss led to the infamous backstage gang war setup between chute box and hammer house rampage jackson overeem barnett and i think another guy imagine if hell broke loose who the hell would stop them lmao wanderlei would be going crazy
MMA,not_removed,not quite since its always you might or might not a tournament semi final win would lead to a guaranteed finals spot which if you won would give you the grand prix title
MMA,not_removed,hurricain velasquez
MMA,not_removed,if he eats a flush knee from overeem thatll be the limit the sound those things make when they land is sickening
MMA,not_removed,that griffin fight doesnt get credit for being the huge upset that it was from until that fight shogun was the best and most impressive fighter in the sport not even fedor looked better than him the shogun fights forrest and gases like he was in the last mile of a marathon i think that was the real beginning of chronically injured shogun
MMA,not_removed,no fair the ufc took away his prime weapon flying head stomps
MMA,not_removed,i mean its the fight game win some lose some he was still a beast after the forrest loss but i feel shoguns decline was from the jones fight and onward
MMA,not_removed,rumors are that baroni koed wanderlei back there lol street fights are unpredictable
MMA,not_removed,shogun was the best and most impressive fighter in the sport not even fedor looked better than him i think the plan was to have a fedor vs shogun fight if shogun had beat coleman wanderlei had the title so shogun moved to hw if that fight had happened it would have been bigger than fedor vs crocop even if shogun had won against coleman it probably wouldnt have happened since pride was sold right after pride
MMA,not_removed,he elbowed the shit out of him right i remember that fight being uncomfortably brutal
MMA,not_removed,i heard someone said that krazy horse also kod wanderlei once not sure if its true or not
MMA,not_removed,alright who hasnt kod wanderlei
MMA,not_removed,conor mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,rwatchpeopledie
MMA,not_removed,good to see magna cum laude graduates of the mario yamasaki school of officiating
MMA,not_removed,he got hit so hard he went straight to and planked
MMA,not_removed,he used the towel to cover the dead body
MMA,not_removed,prior to this fight taktarov had won the ufc tournament while goodridge had made it to the finals of ufc a good fight to book for prides debut show and it delivered
MMA,not_removed,there was an attempt
MMA,not_removed,mani loved watching oleg in the early ufcs his stoic demeanor was the forerunner to fedors i think
MMA,not_removed,that ref was late as fuck
MMA,not_removed,the last punch was particularly brutal i just noticed the speed difference in the and shots he lands when hes face down
MMA,not_removed,goodridge used to be scary as fuck
MMA,not_removed,nice knowing you oleg
MMA,not_removed,jesus
MMA,not_removed,oh man its like hes planking dated as fuck reference i know absolutly brutal edit holy shit oleg taktarov was peter stormares main henchman in bad boys
MMA,not_removed,this was high school level funny i laughed a little too hard at this ahhh memories
MMA,not_removed,if i wasnt broke id gild this legitimately hilarious
MMA,not_removed,agreed although his superfight with ken shamrock is up there with the most boring fights ive ever seen
MMA,not_removed,goodridge is now paying the price for steroid jacked people hitting him entirely unnecessarily but god dang goodridge handed out a lot of it himself
MMA,not_removed,you should check out the movie minutes he gets a lot of camera time in that one
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,whos gonna laugh at that
MMA,not_removed,yeah hilarious
MMA,not_removed,and making movies still
MMA,not_removed,lmao go fight lawler since you said thats the fight you want thats hilarious woodley musta felt hurt
MMA,not_removed,i could stomach bisping vs henderson cuz there was at least a small knock you could make on all the top contenders but if wonderboy doesnt get the next shot then this is just as much of a shitshow as boxing
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say its savage he said you young bucks can battle it out like gastelum and magny please wonder boy just beat rory thats bs
MMA,not_removed,i mean wonderboy did say november and woodley wants to fight nick in weeks woodley could do both fights if he wanted towon while wonderboy waited
MMA,not_removed,moronic thats what happens when you book ranked middleweight for a title shot fucking nonsense i watch this sport to know whos the best fuck the fucking drama
MMA,not_removed,i could see gsp being ahead of wonderboy for that title shot but not nick diaz nick is on a fight losing streak and no way deserves to fight for the title tyron is gonna catch a lot of heat for this
MMA,not_removed,go fight lawler since you said thats the fight you want im gonna get my money hes petty af and i love it lmao
MMA,not_removed,i get the feeling that its going to be a good while before we see woodley fight again im hoping he gets back in there soon but woodley knows theres a ton of money that can be earned by carrying around that strap and woodley is great at maximizing his income
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxkulkumxypg
MMA,not_removed,i love how all of a sudden nick diaz is treated as someone who would be like a fight you say i dont care who it is im in
MMA,not_removed,again this is another reason why i need to give less fucks about these title fights and more about better match ups instead
MMA,not_removed,im hoping wonderboy gets the title fight although nick on the same card as nate in a few weeks i couldnt deny thatd be amazing id really be rooting for nick then wonderboy would definitely deserve that fight
MMA,not_removed,as my old man used to say you can shit in one hand and wish in the other and see which one fills up first woodley can call all the shots he wants hes at the mercy of diaz gsp and the ufc the ufc booked demetrious johnson v wilson reis for gods sake its weird it feels like most of reddit was dismissive and tired of woodleys shit and now all of a sudden hes the peoples champion he has no personality and at times makes some delusional statements a money fight will be these guys doing him a favor not the other way around
MMA,not_removed,does anyone have a link to it sounds pretty hilarious
MMA,not_removed,diaz v woodley sounds fun fuck it just do it not like wonderboy can fight right now anyway
MMA,not_removed,has an imminent nick diaz return been discussed before tonight
MMA,not_removed,they should sign the lawler vs diaz rematch was hard to justify when lawler was champ but now its perfect
MMA,not_removed,i see woodleys logic and i cant blame him we talk about a fighters union fighters not being paid enough fighters needing to put themselves first etc thats exactly what woodley is doing with trying to get a money fight on with diaz or gsp and its exactly what he did waiting for a title shot he was promised this is just woodley stating what he wants nothing wrong with that i hope wonderboy gets the next shot or doesnt have to fight again before getting a shot but if woodley wants on and wonderboy wants to fight in november why not have both no need to bash woodley for trying to make as much money as possible
MMA,not_removed,lol good for woodley smart move i like the new champ
MMA,not_removed,i think nick could out jab and out last him like rory did wear him out and not get knocked out
MMA,not_removed,nick doesnt want to fight on the same card as nate so it wont happen
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say woodley is ducking wonderboy ufc is a couple of weeks away
MMA,not_removed,bitch move by woodley he should be saying hell ko wonderboy or whatever but instead he called out a guy he thinks he can beat easily who hasnt fought in a while and told the next ww contender to fight someone else
MMA,not_removed,woodley sounds worried wonderboy is a much more dimensional fighter
MMA,not_removed,i love this
MMA,not_removed,i would pay money to watch a diaz brother fight a fucking ferret mad props to woodley for calling out the real money fight
MMA,not_removed,shit if we can throw woodley vs diaz on why not
MMA,not_removed,bullshit hope woodley gets fucking tooled by his next opponent if he wants to be the best like he says he does then he has to beat the best he knows wonderboy will beat him im fed up of the ufc making irrelevant title fights when there are more deserving challengers eg bisping v hendo
MMA,not_removed,i like it get your bread tyron when you ko the fuck out of the champion you can call some shots
MMA,not_removed,can you post the link to the segment by any chance
MMA,not_removed,in for clip
MMA,not_removed,haha need to see this
MMA,not_removed,you cant tell someone to go fight a guy who just got knocked out no telling if they will be ready to fight again in months or a year
MMA,not_removed,tremendous segment wonderful time to be an mma fan
MMA,not_removed,call it crazy but woodley wants to get paid shame on him
MMA,not_removed,the mcgregor effect we knew it was coming i see what woodleys doing and i think is the smartest way of looking at it
MMA,not_removed,i really dont like having analysts call out a fighter minutes after they win a championship fight last night shouldve been about woodley
MMA,not_removed,pretty weak he aint getting the diaz fight time wise and diaz probably not interested nor the gsp fight probably not big enougheasy enough for gsp thompson got the right tools to defeat woodley i will be excited for that match up
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy should have said dont be scared homie
MMA,not_removed,yeah in an interview with ariel pre fight he said the same thing said gastelum is the only guy in the division who knows woodley will win cuz hes asking for the rematch while everyone else asks for rob said they can go fight rob in a non title bout while he does a money fight haha this is all according to plan for the chosen one
MMA,not_removed,at least in boxing fighters get stripped of their belt
MMA,not_removed,lets leave boxing out of this last night santa cruz vs frampton was awesome two young undefeated fighters went all out
MMA,not_removed,at least with woodleydiaz you could feel like the winner is the champ nothing hendo could do to bisping would make me feel he is the true champion and best middleweight
MMA,not_removed,dont be so quick to count out nick for all we know woodley could get paul daleyed
MMA,not_removed,if woodley wants to fight nick that soon it doesnt really hold anything up wonderboy is out till novemebrr carlos condit and demian maia are scheduled to fight neil magny is already on against lorenz larkin rory is potentially getting nose surgerygoing to bellator matt brown just lost hendricks is on a downward spiral so why not nick it only matters in the sense that nick might be too rusty for this fight to be fighting against someone as dangerous as woodley nobody wants to see nick get finished but i do have a lot of faith in him personally
MMA,not_removed,if the guy wants to fight in days and defend his belt and the ufc is down to let him fuck it lets do it how can you not be okay w that thats the part im very down with is the quick turnaround
MMA,not_removed,diaz brothers on the same card though idk manif they can make it happen at it really wouldnt stall the division much at all
MMA,not_removed,its cage fighting the best fighter doesnt always win
MMA,not_removed,to be fair heaps of fighters were ragging on woodley for getting the shot including wonderboy and matt brown
MMA,not_removed,the man said august imo he gets one injury
MMA,not_removed,that makes no sense he wont make money carrying the strap he will make money defending it
MMA,not_removed,he said he wanted to fight in weeks
MMA,not_removed,true nick didnt care for a belt i thought just money
MMA,not_removed,its really not though woodley has no say in who he fights and hell be fighting wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,just start gambling then every fight is exciting as a title fight lol
MMA,not_removed,it feels like most of reddit was dismissive and tired of woodleys shit and now all of a sudden hes the peoples champion its actually the opposite i feel there was a brief window where woodley could have been the peoples champ then he opened his mouth and said this shit
MMA,not_removed,no when youre the champ you have responsibilities dont just fight washed up over the hill names rather than contenders especially in this case since losing to rory macdonald tyron has beaten dong hyun kim in and split decisioned gastelum oh and he made weight oneday when hendricks couldnt since then wonderboy has fought and beat hendricks and rory who was up on the scorecards going into the fifth against lawler wonderboy was ahead of woodley in most peoples opinion and for woodley to get the title turn around and say no is pretty petty not to mention that the very reason he was able to get his shot was because lawler was doing what a champion should do in taking on challengers rather than pursuing money fights the only thing woodley brings into a money fight is the belt which he was only able to get because the former champ wasnt as cowardly as he is
MMA,not_removed,you dont need to chat shit to be big in mma just look at gsp one of the biggest mix martial artists ever didnt chat a lot of shit
MMA,not_removed,after bitching and moaning about how was being treated and how he earned his shot wonderboy earned his shot too
MMA,not_removed,except mcgregor was the money fight he didnt go out looking to fight a ppv draw he made himself the biggest attraction in town these guys like alavarez woodley and bisping are trying to be in a money fight instead of finding ways of becoming the money fight
MMA,not_removed,fighters talk a lot of trash when theyre full of adrenaline
MMA,not_removed,that would have been such an amazing call out it would make chael p sonnen blush
MMA,not_removed,is that in reference to something
MMA,not_removed,give it some time for them to come up with a good plan oh they have a good plan already and if they dont they have one better than tyron woodleys suggesting well see what the ufc says but the point is that they shouldnt enable woodley
MMA,not_removed,nick hasnt won a ww fight since and the last guys he beat arent even in the ufc how is that any better than hendo in this situation
MMA,not_removed,i think a few fighters see the diaz style as not threatening and feel they can take them out but then they get in there and it does not go as planned not with stockton mother fucker thats when keeping it real goes wrong
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy is out till novemebrr hm
MMA,not_removed,fight november with wonderboy and make the winner fight the winner of maiacondit after if woodley fights nick the winner is never going to fight before january and meanwhile you get hanged with the winner of maiacondit as a contender that wont fight next because there is another contender waiting already it is a stupid fight to make in the first place especially versus a guy that has not a win in the ufc for the last what years
MMA,not_removed,if he wants a quick turnaround good but i bet you alot of ranked contenders would fight him at
MMA,not_removed,because then he could get injured and be sidelined for whoever knows how long and the real contender is just sitting around
MMA,not_removed,yeah im sort of ok with this one because initially when hes calling out diaz gsp i was like the fuck but when hes saying hell do it at well hes never fighting thompson with days notice you need a full camp for that
MMA,not_removed,has nick even been training hes always out clubbing which im sure wouldnt stop him from accepting any fight but that fights makes sense and its obvious its just a way to dodge wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,they need to wait until ufc
MMA,not_removed,theyve said before that they wouldnt fight in the same card im a die hard diaz fan but wonderboy has done more than enough to earn his title shot
MMA,not_removed,nick nate do not want to fight on the same card theyve said this many times they prefer to be able to support each other and not have to worry about anyone else there is already one other scrap pack fighter on the card there is no way that nate and nick will want nick on the card too
MMA,not_removed,yeah like another user mentioned it only puts off wonderboy by around weeks give or take
MMA,not_removed,rightly so too id say he hadnt fought for a year and a half and his last fight wasnt a stand out performance
MMA,not_removed,when was he ragging on him about that all he said was that he was upset that woodley got the title shot over him
MMA,not_removed,i think part of that is if woodley gets any ppv points being a champion and is the real so hell make some money
MMA,not_removed,if hes ever listened to a diaz he should know they do not share fight cards and are against it so everything he said is hot air bullshit he looked like a clown ducking him
MMA,not_removed,being able to promote yourself as ufc world champion opens up a lot of doors to sponsors and im sure even acting tyron has a fantastic management team and im sure its something theyll discuss
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt tyron is nobody for a big name but maybe the belt adds enough for diaz to care nick fights tyron wins goes up fights bisping comes division champ but gets caught with weed in his system and is suspended for years walks away from the sport as division champ
MMA,not_removed,woodley will fight whoever is gonna make the ufc more money diaz will pull in more seats than wonderboy unfortunately
MMA,not_removed,funny because i put on lawler at although i wasnt really comfortable making that bet at the time and throughout the week of the fight i was even saying things along the lines of that lawler has been in so many wars that i wouldnt be surprised if he gets kod by woodley
MMA,not_removed,who really has any responsibilities though dan gets to fight bisping conor got to abandon his belt to fight a journeyman welterweight brock gets to fight without having to test first now youre gonna shit on woodley because he made a comeback to wonderboy saying hed rather fight lawler time to put on your big boy pants and really realize what youre watching the f in ufc doesnt stand for fair you should know that by now tyrons all good with me over here
MMA,not_removed,i think wonder boy earned his crack at the title but lets also look at the obvious woodley wants to capitalize as much as he can now that he holds the title gsp or diaz would be a payday wonderboy risk of losing the belt without a huge pay out call it crazy unless he hated money hes making the right call for himself
MMA,not_removed,i agree with you on that but woodley would never be as popular as mcgregor he just simply lacks the personality to do it so he has to take shortcuts and use a different strategy to make money
MMA,not_removed,it isnt its all silly i can live with hendoat least with nick one is a champ all of it is absurd both of them are bad fights from a rankings perspective and any logic to try to justify seeing one and not the other or one is sorta justifiable doesnt hold up
MMA,not_removed,plus with hendo it would be a guy beating the lineal champ you are the champ if you beat the champ
MMA,not_removed,well nick wouldnt really be legit but i put more stock in tyron defending against an unworthy opponent than bisping i know bisping won the belt legitimately though so i see how my opinion is disagreeable but thats just me
MMA,not_removed,hahahaha what episode of the chappelle show is that voiceover from if you got any idea
MMA,not_removed,just guessing but maybe medical suspension from last fight didnt he break something
MMA,not_removed,im not sure id believe a lot of the top ranked guys ahead of nick would take the fight in days id still rank nick above gastelum at but yeah if any of em want it give it to them
MMA,not_removed,why would he get injured he wasnt even touched in the fight hes going right back into camp but hes already in peak shape all hed have to do is tweak his training plan as such
MMA,not_removed,he knows his suspension is up id be shocked if he wasnt in great shape right now and training i dont want any dodging my big point here though is if a champ especially one who just had to deal w a long layoff wants a quick turnaround give it to him everybody hates on the hendo decision which is fine but everybody is also in denial about jacare being able to be ready for october which is a very quick awesome turnaround for bisping i for one am happy when the belts are defended often and we dont have situations like cain
MMA,not_removed,fuck yes put the entire scrap pack on that card fuck it resign shields and everything
MMA,not_removed,ufc stockton vs the world damn i wish it was
MMA,not_removed,nate isnt going to cockblock nick for a title shot though
MMA,not_removed,thats assuming a lot of things
MMA,not_removed,yea well the truth is thompson was more deserving even before he fought rory by the time stephen gets shot he would have to beat everyone in the top if woodley gets his way
MMA,not_removed,said that woodley would lose and hed prefer to fight robbie its not ragging on the same level as matt brown who said he would fight woodley in a carpark or someshit but its still disrespectful woodley telling him to go fight robbie since thats the fight he claimed he wanted is a pretty good burn
MMA,not_removed,his popularity isnt going to grow that much in months unless he defends his belt against a big name and if he defends it in a week he could still defend it in months and make double the money that is what he is thinking
MMA,not_removed,theres no way i can i look at diaz vs woodley and find diaz coming out with a win he has the diazkilling combination of giganticwrestlerleg kicker
MMA,not_removed,woodley has no leverage its all up to the ufc so dont be fooled hes no conor mcgregor hell fight whenever they want him to if they want diazwoodley then it will happen if they want him to fight wonderboy on fightpass then it will happen he can be stripped of his title if hes inactive
MMA,not_removed,im not sure why but there was a lot of demand for hendo v bisping theres no demand for woodley diaz people want to see wonderboy get his shot now youre gonna shit on woodley because he made a comeback to wonderboy saying hed rather fight lawler no the comeback is fine but a he shouldnt be able to refuse a challenger because of it it wasnt just a comeback and b wonderboy was asked which he would rather face ie who he was hoping would win wonderboy clarified first of all that he wanted to fight the champ and then secondly said and he would prefer it to be lawler because he will have been a more dominant champ at that point than woodley which is true wonderboy was clearly no contender and assumed he would fight lawler next when tyron got the shot he probably looked at the fight and decided that lawler as the odds on favorite would retain and so continued to train for lawler although probably less specifically then he got asked hypothetically who would you rather face obviously he went with the guy that made a better story and that he had been training for what would you have answered woodley the boring black rockhold please and if lawler won and wonderboy had said woodley would he lose his shot the f in ufc doesnt stand for fair you should know that by now tyrons all good with me over here no but they do have some semblance of doing what the right thing did dana give guy the f in ufc doesnt stand for fair fuckface they dont do the right thing all the time they dont do the wrong thing all the time its not all or nothing theres a balance there and i think letting woodley duck wonderboy is way off what they would normally do
MMA,not_removed,i cant find anything that claims that
MMA,not_removed,why would he get injured because its a fight and injuries happen lol
MMA,not_removed,ufc stockton vs ireland mcgregor vs nate diaz gunnar nelson vs nick diaz cathal pendred vs jake shields joe duffy vs gilbert melendez artem lobov vs chris avila aisling daly vs keri taylor paddy holohan vs kron gracie
MMA,not_removed,nick isnt going to cockblock nate over a ludicrous payday
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt need to be popular the companies will want to use ufc champion whoeverthefuckitis uses our shit and hes a straight up beast on their packaging i mean pettis was on a cereal box ffs fighters get paid for having that belt
MMA,not_removed,i think he knows he doesnt have a ton of leverage but hes putting these fights out there in hopes of them sounding attractive to the ufc hes probably thinking if bisping convinced them to give him the hendo fight then maybe i can do the same thing lets just hope the ufc doesnt do it
MMA,not_removed,he might have injured his neck by ducking wonderboy so hard but thats about it i think
MMA,not_removed,ireland goes winless save for maybe duffy
MMA,not_removed,how would nick be cockblocking nate
MMA,not_removed,this werdum was all over my old workout mags plugging some supplement and hes not even real ripped or anything but it doesnt matter when youre the undisputed ufc heavyweight champion thatll sell some supplements and woodley actually is jacked
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i think they all would have a decent shot except for cathal and maybe gunnar
MMA,not_removed,hes not going to do anything which makes nate feel like he should kill the fight nick cares about money not titles
MMA,not_removed,you think wrong
MMA,not_removed,nick unable to make money but nate is nick nate is making money i legit think that they just have a single joint account
MMA,not_removed,i would just like to say that is the most ghetto fight poster ever lmao
MMA,not_removed,that is the most crudely edited poster i think ive ever seen floyd mustve made that himself
MMA,not_removed,holy shit but i donÂ´t think it is happening the ufc logo would be there somewere
MMA,not_removed,cbs so is it going to be free
MMA,not_removed,holy fuck how many times do the mods have to delete this shit
MMA,not_removed,podcasting is about honesty any ufc produced podcast will lack that
MMA,not_removed,as someone who started listening to mma podcasts while going to sleep followed by while at work while at the gym while commuting etc this is great news i always seem to run out of things to listen to
MMA,not_removed,yeah it will be like the hbo or showtime boxing podcasts just reinforce the promotions narrative
MMA,not_removed,if its gonna be bullshit people will sniff it quickly and not listen
MMA,not_removed,the best part of this was when goldy uses his canned line of that is the karate kid and then rogan has like some sort of epiphany because goldy inadvertently said something brilliant
MMA,not_removed,no can defend
MMA,not_removed,man lyoto is the shit im imagining a different time where wonderboy and lyoto couldve gone at it in their best shape
MMA,not_removed,can you imagine seeing wonderboy vs machida
MMA,not_removed,welcome to the machida era
MMA,not_removed,i was there for ufc was crazy
MMA,not_removed,wasnt randy or when this happened
MMA,not_removed,but an incredible fight
MMA,not_removed,machida would be too big for him machidas grappling and judo would be too much considering the size difference
MMA,not_removed,yeah he was sent him into retirement
MMA,not_removed,it was a very good fight i should probably watch it again some time
MMA,not_removed,machida is only taller than wonderboy plus wonderboy has a reach advantage i know that machida is heavier but other than that they are pretty much even in size i think it would be an awesome matchup
MMA,not_removed,lyoto doesnt have any judo background also they are relatively the same size same height slight reach advantage for wonderboy if wonderboy puts on pounds they are virtually identical that would be a karate fight for the ages
MMA,not_removed,just like gsp doesnt have a wrestling background his wrestling training was part of his mma training
MMA,not_removed,i understand my point was i would never use judo in a sentence to describe lyoto hes a bjj black belt and the mother fuckin karate kid
MMA,not_removed,his waza foot techniques shouldnt go without mentioning especially in a theoretical wonderboy fight
MMA,not_removed,watch jon pull out just to let us down one more time
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan experience with jon jones will not happen mark my words chael sonnen
MMA,not_removed,that air is gonna be anything but clear nomsaiyan
MMA,not_removed,joe id like to take this chance to apologize to absolutely nobody
MMA,not_removed,hope theyre just smoking blunts the whole time
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if hell have redban on and he and jones can commiserate over bad gas station dick pills
MMA,not_removed,joe should get joey diaz on at the same time lol
MMA,not_removed,joe will go super easy on him i fear
MMA,not_removed,i just want to hear jon jones take on the gulf of tonkin incident
MMA,not_removed,secret cohost joey diaz now heres what you do jon jones you take of these stars of death and then when usada come around to collect your piss you just put a bit of draino on the tip of your helmet youll piss clean and youll beat that test like a doctah hit that mutha fuckin music lee
MMA,not_removed,respectfully joe youre a pussy usada is a bunch of pussies dc is a pussy dana is a pussy and the biggest pussy of allis me im the pussy are you still there pussy yes yes i am single tear
MMA,not_removed,oh shit
MMA,not_removed,you mean muddy the waters further i doubt he clears anything up what he will do is contradict what he has already said claim its the truth and then contradict himself again in another interview a year down the road
MMA,not_removed,iits all gods plan jon no bones jones
MMA,not_removed,big jre fan but joe is going to totally soft ball some questions at him i totally get hes not an investigative reporter or whatever but theres a few times ive been listening and hes just nodding along to some total shit
MMA,not_removed,spoiler alert turns out jon was a great man all along and this clear pattern of behavior over the course of many years was just a bunch of coincidences and misunderstandings
MMA,not_removed,my dick joe my dick let me down
MMA,not_removed,lol we all know jon jones has fucked up a plethora of times but personally im excited for when joe asks questions about his time at jw his personal back story his mentality going into fights etc nothing he says is going to make me think hes a great guy but it would definitely be interesting to see how one of the goats approaches competition
MMA,not_removed,whats the chances of a accidental eye poke during the podcast
MMA,not_removed,i wonder what his opinions on the wage gap tower and onnit are
MMA,not_removed,holy shit this is about to be one of the best podcasts of all time no way something controversial doesnt happen with hours of jon jones talking lol
MMA,not_removed,sorry thursday turns out youre not going to be a productive one for me
MMA,not_removed,oh good so well get an hour and a half of jons fake bullshit just like his walk and talk with ariel i bet hell spend minutes talking about how happy he is that hes not addicted to marijuana anymore i wish he would at least just be himself instead of putting on a persona everytime he knows a camera is on him hed be a bigger star that way too
MMA,not_removed,i hope usada makes an appearance as well right in the middle of the podcast
MMA,not_removed,ugh clear the air yet again eh are we to be convinced he is suddenly a good person and not a complete pos human being im sure he will speak on finding a higher power etc and how that has made him better sorry hes a proven shit head
MMA,not_removed,joe better ask him about the hiding from usada story chael told
MMA,not_removed,yeeessss never changed thee flair lets go champ wooo
MMA,not_removed,i honestly dont even care if they talk about his current suspension or any other incidents from jones past i just love when joe gets high profile fighters on the show let alone one of the greatest who has ever fought really looking forward to this
MMA,not_removed,could get a little spicy
MMA,not_removed,i cant wait to listen to hours of his empty words and mannequinlike personality by this time ive just ruled jon as dead inside and wish hed just own ithis life is a facade
MMA,not_removed,imagine rogan rolling weed in front of jones
MMA,not_removed,seriously though this is bullshit right i cant find a single source that confirms this
MMA,not_removed,he says it around mark very very end
MMA,not_removed,thanks joe i really appreciate this opportunity to tell everyone my newest batch of lies
MMA,not_removed,i predict jones will be more of his real self here on jre i think hell come out of it with more fans not less just a feeling source im high as fuuuuuck
MMA,not_removed,i just hope joe can keep this about mma and not go on a keto hunting weed rant
MMA,not_removed,imagine if he just came in plugged in an air purifier and left
MMA,not_removed,sorry jon no fucking way you are going to convince me it was tainted boner pills
MMA,not_removed,i would be so happy if joe says asks the tough questions like isnt it pretty convenient that you just so happened to have tainted erection pills what about that test that flagged the dubious te ratio etc and jones storms out joe sits there dumbfounded for a second and looks into the camera with the patented then yells into the mic hey jones you still there pussy
MMA,not_removed,hopefully joe doesnt have schaub on for this one because i plan on watching it i dont hate schaub per se but i just cant stand his nasally voice expert opinions and his joe camel face its fucked up when someone posts a clip of him getting sent to the shadow realm on ig and i see all these people tagging him so he would see it until i remember his match against cyborg then it becomes hilarious ive come to the conclusion that brendan schaub is the mma equivalent of nickleback
MMA,not_removed,hopefully they smoke a few blunts so jon lets his natural douchey true self come out
MMA,not_removed,joes not gotta question any of jons story whatsoever i like joe but when it comes to these fighters excuses for testing positive for peds anderson mendes etc he always buys their excuses at face value even citing andersons cialis excuse way before it became public this is coming from the same guy who always assumes and talks about how rampant peds are in sport and how many guys probably use them he obviously has a personal connection and a work connection to a lot of these guys and his voice has a lot of influence part of me doesnt believe that joe actually buys all this tainted supplement stuff and other excuses
MMA,not_removed,first briggs and now jones the podcast has been great recently
MMA,not_removed,ohhhhh boy christmas has come early d
MMA,not_removed,interesting bones will have to drop the fake shit and be natural on jre
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i would love if joe actually asked him some honest tough questions about what happened
MMA,not_removed,air will be as clean as it is in china not that iÂ´ve been to china but i saw a picture on the internet once
MMA,not_removed,i sure fucking hope he doesnt bring malki i know joe has talked about some people wanting to come on the show and wanting to bring managers and shit
MMA,not_removed,oh fuck this has potential to be one of the best jres ever im excited as fuck for this mainly i just miss jon they could talk about anything and ill tune in
MMA,not_removed,i feel like i would be excited for this since im a jones apologist but i know hell just be fake as fuck about learning his lesson and giving to the community or some shit this is his chance to be real and make a real impression on people but his shitty pr managers are gona make him say nothing about anything
MMA,not_removed,lies fairytales fallacies coming in
MMA,not_removed,awesome
MMA,not_removed,nice so psyched to hear hours of cliches and non answers
MMA,not_removed,what are the odds malki is there with him
MMA,not_removed,whenwhere does joe mention that jon will be on the podcast
MMA,not_removed,i often wonder what would happen if joe pissed off a fighter to the point of the fighterwell fighting would he and jamie be enough to subdue the fighter
MMA,not_removed,who gives a fook
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if rogan will offer him some caveman coffee with butter
MMA,not_removed,im interested but not
MMA,not_removed,there is no need to clear the air we know who jon is just get your shit together and go in there and be the baddest muthafucker on the planet
MMA,not_removed,any talk of the controversy will just be jones manufactured excuses and fake apologies while joe goes along with everything the stuff outside that will probably be cool though
MMA,not_removed,if he actually clears the air i will be shocked something tells me it will end up sounding like the war machine episode where everything is someone elses fault but i hope he can change my opinion
MMA,not_removed,hopefully this isnt a hr podcast id like to hear joe get into it with jon not in a fighty way but like joe thinks jon jones is one of the best fighters to ever live but also kind of gave a tone of sick of his shit joe isnt one to back down from fuck you questions either should be good
MMA,not_removed,maybe he will announce that hes gay
MMA,not_removed,and a special surprise guest dc and jones can duke it out in joes garage
MMA,not_removed,theres nothing at all to clear up he should just go there and have a conversation no talk like with armstrong needed
MMA,not_removed,hes going to bring up god watch and how hes not really a cheater
MMA,not_removed,with the amount of chances he had there is no clearing the airits already clear hes a piece of shit
MMA,not_removed,goes in to clear the air farts
MMA,not_removed,does this stream live or do you have to wait for the download to listen
MMA,not_removed,clear the air or spin the truth
MMA,not_removed,the goat is here
MMA,not_removed,lets go champ jon jones is till was never lost can never be taken away
MMA,not_removed,fuck jon jones
MMA,not_removed,why even bother no one with any amount of common sense believes jon popped for clomid because it was accidentally included in a supplement or dick pills provided by a friend sorry jon you may have loop holed youre way out of a long suspension but the fans arent that stupid
MMA,not_removed,idk if i can go of jons phoney christian shtick god put me here or there for a reason no you keep fucking up
MMA,not_removed,clear the air or spin the truth
MMA,not_removed,has this been confirmed
MMA,not_removed,i hope joe doesnt plan on playing softball with jones and doesnt give him a platform to sell his lies some more
MMA,not_removed,whatttttttt
MMA,not_removed,holy fuck this is gonna rock
MMA,not_removed,where does it say that jon jones will be on thursday
MMA,not_removed,finally
MMA,not_removed,this is going to be good
MMA,not_removed,i cant wait for this
MMA,not_removed,fuaaark this gon be good
MMA,not_removed,i can already feel the anger building from jones smugly making a joke about dick pills
MMA,not_removed,im really excited
MMA,not_removed,i bet he smokes weed and falls off the wagon he was never on
MMA,not_removed,wonder if joe will spark up a j during this one
MMA,not_removed,i wonder what jon will show up you cant put on an act for hours especially in the jre
MMA,not_removed,good googly fucking moogly
MMA,not_removed,should have red ban on to grill him on dick pills
MMA,not_removed,holy shit jon motherfucking jones on jre this is gonna be big
MMA,not_removed,this can only do good things for him i would imagine rogans format really lets you see a persons full personality
MMA,not_removed,damnnnnnn
MMA,not_removed,where was this said
MMA,not_removed,is their coke in the air
MMA,not_removed,really looking forward to this
MMA,not_removed,i suggested this guest in a youtube comment and everyone downvoted me saying theres no way he will ever accept jokes on you haters
MMA,not_removed,i expect his pull out just to hurt my heart once again
MMA,not_removed,fuck yes
MMA,not_removed,redemption of the innocent elevation of the persecuted shadows protect ye no longer snakes and vipers the sunlight of truth shall burn ye from this world all glory to jones or its going to be hours of car crash hooker stories
MMA,not_removed,jones reminds me of myself years ago well spoken good upbringing good athlete charismatic but a complete secret drug fiend behind the scenes for ten years of hell i came out of it relatively unscathed but only through miracles of luck his life and career wont end well if he doesnt get some solid professional help and some structure in his life
MMA,not_removed,given i know exactly how this is going to go i might just do something else with the time
MMA,not_removed,op where did you get this information the link you provide shows no such thing it is a link to the current podcast with jordan peterson
MMA,not_removed,do it jon go full heel embrace it
MMA,not_removed,sooo many questions
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if hes going to bring his pr manager with him
MMA,not_removed,fuck yes
MMA,not_removed,right when joes show get stale he knows how to drag me back
MMA,not_removed,watch jon and joe both go heel and just light up and shoot the shit for hours
MMA,not_removed,joe better wear sunglasses or safety goggles
MMA,not_removed,you think im just gonna sit here and let you entertain me jon
MMA,not_removed,imagine jon walks out after a sensitive question i hope jamie then plays an audio clip of mike goldberg saying and it is all over
MMA,not_removed,seems like a bad idea to talk about everything before the hearing see how much he actually says
MMA,not_removed,the only thing thats not clear about the situation is if he will ever own up to anything and admit he was juicing
MMA,not_removed,you haters would say this shit to jon irl hes jacked
MMA,not_removed,id rather he just clear his blood stream
MMA,not_removed,boy oh boy this should be good wish more fighters would appear on jre
MMA,not_removed,dum dum jon jones on the next jre jones in a room with pot and booze fun times ahead
MMA,not_removed,wear mcgregor style glasses joe eyes might get poked when you high five jones
MMA,not_removed,o fuck yes
MMA,not_removed,ill believe it when i see it
MMA,not_removed,what time will this air
MMA,not_removed,im going to be very disappointed if redban isnt there to talk with him about boner pills
MMA,not_removed,ohhhh shit son
MMA,not_removed,so we will hear without further ado john jones or will he remember and not say it
MMA,not_removed,sobsplz jon
MMA,not_removed,if im jj pr manager id be begging him not to
MMA,not_removed,i will totally hatewatch that episode
MMA,not_removed,i just want to hear some fun stories
MMA,not_removed,sounds dangerous for jon
MMA,not_removed,he took the steroid dick pills to honor christ and spread his word praise
MMA,not_removed,who
MMA,not_removed,he can clear the air but cant clean his body system actions speak louder than words
MMA,not_removed,sweet
MMA,not_removed,damn cant wait
MMA,not_removed,play a drinking game and take a sip every time one of them says dick pills hgh roids and mistake
MMA,not_removed,i really hope joe pulls no punches i dont think the dude is mean and he certainly has his biases and blind spots but for the most part hes really shy about tearing people down not even in a mean or vindictive way just directly and intelligently asking and pointing out what of people cant or wont see how literally retired brendan schaub who is definitely a friend of his this could be a turning point in jons career i dont think it will but it could
MMA,not_removed,fuck yesss
MMA,not_removed,fucking yes
MMA,not_removed,hell yeah i miss all of the old episodes with actual fighting stars like gsp and chael i dont remember if jj has been on before but im looking forward to hearing what he has to say for himself i really want to respect all of his accomplishments but its hard to see the champion past the man in his case
MMA,not_removed,at least you cant fail a dr
MMA,not_removed,good googlymoogly
MMA,not_removed,malki better stay in the fucking car
MMA,not_removed,i want to see jon being introduced with a joint in his hand and the other hand pointing at joe saying you and i both fucking know i wasnt smoking weed respectfully thats all i want can i get that much
MMA,not_removed,jj is one annoying mf
MMA,not_removed,wicked
MMA,not_removed,fuck yes thats sick
MMA,not_removed,cant wait to hear joe tell bones he should start a podcast
MMA,not_removed,buys all the popcorn
MMA,not_removed,this should be good
MMA,not_removed,jon jones have you heard of
MMA,not_removed,powerful
MMA,not_removed,hell talk a lot about how hard all this is on him and how it is making him a better person all through gods plan for jon job jones
MMA,not_removed,guess what im not going to believe him seeiously what is their to clead he isnt even gonna come on and be himself just put on that front again and tell ud things hes said before apologize and swear it wont happen again
MMA,not_removed,i smell shit all ready
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,what time in the podcast does he mention jj coming on dec
MMA,not_removed,damn for a second i actually thought this was real thanks reddit
MMA,not_removed,its interesting how jones would choose jre of all places to finally speak publicly joes not required to stick to any journalistic integrity he might steer the conversation in a weird way
MMA,not_removed,i thought the air cleared after he fled to the high mountains post hit and run
MMA,not_removed,yeah hes probably just gonna dodge every real question or he will speak to joe before hand to make sure certain things are asked yeah it was dick pills hes going to say hes a year old athlete who uses dick pills while im training and everyone will just have to buy it because nobody does steroids
MMA,not_removed,well this has me pretty excited
MMA,not_removed,i just recently started listening to his podcast and its good he also very diverse with the people he brings on and the topics they talk about
MMA,not_removed,i hope we see joe give him bullshit eyes at some point can we please make a bingo for things that could be said
MMA,not_removed,wont be able to appear because he fails a drug test
MMA,not_removed,i hope they talk about something other than his legal issues i genuinely want a look into the mind of this phenomenal fighterprobable sociopath
MMA,not_removed,you cant not have redban on this podcast considering he was the smoking gun
MMA,not_removed,fuck jon jones
MMA,not_removed,yes finally
MMA,not_removed,wow i sure dindt expect that d
MMA,not_removed,i hope they both just chain smoke js the whole time
MMA,not_removed,the air aint clear when jon jones near
MMA,not_removed,watch him spout all this garbage about how this is a test from god
MMA,not_removed,jon jones is reppin febreeze huh interesting
MMA,not_removed,there is nothing on the page saying that jon jones will be on the jre podcast or am i blind someone point me in the right direction
MMA,not_removed,i hope thats just a small part of the podcast it really doesnt matter how or why he tested positive the results are what they are i would be way more interested in actually listening to the real jon just talking and get to know who he is
MMA,not_removed,what can we expect from rogan
MMA,not_removed,you have to say this is a huge scoop for rogan sure he has big guests on a lot of the time but this is a really big one
MMA,not_removed,joe dick riding incoming
MMA,not_removed,hope joe puts him on the spot at least a little bit if this is just hours of jones whining and lying its gonna suck
MMA,not_removed,can we get redban on this
MMA,not_removed,does it really matter what jon jones has to say the guy has all the talent in the world but cant get out of his own way jj has to get his life in order and let his actions in and out of the ring do the talking before ill care again
MMA,not_removed,huh clear what air no one has been talking about jon jones
MMA,not_removed,i really wish that joe invites redban to spread some knlowlege about dick pills
MMA,not_removed,joe you are arguably the greatest fighter of all time
MMA,not_removed,hope redban tags along and they have a discussion about their favourite boner pills
MMA,not_removed,rjoerogaine has started doing jumping jacks
MMA,not_removed,hopefully its just pure banter andor bones goes full heel
MMA,not_removed,no fucking way
MMA,not_removed,oh man this is gonna be good wonder if joe will try and give him the talk
MMA,not_removed,how do we know this does he have a calendar
MMA,not_removed,anytime jones is brought up on that show rogan generally suggests that he embraces being the bad guy and to keep partying obviously that hasnt worked out too well for him i cant think of a worse place he could air his grievances or get advice
MMA,not_removed,jones is goat
MMA,not_removed,powerful jon jones
MMA,not_removed,anyone know what time its on i thought i heard somewhere
MMA,not_removed,could only been more scripted if he were holding flash cards while the most interesting and funny parts are when he went off the leash im tired on the fake holier than thou persona bring the jones v dc dude back and i will be interested in your story otherwise i have stopped caring
MMA,not_removed,oh piss off weve moved on jon
MMA,not_removed,rogan you spineless company man call him out on his shit please
MMA,not_removed,hopefully daddy joe comes out like he did with brendan schaub can you imagine the verbal talk down that is about to come out if jj tries to bs his way out of some things hopefully joe sets jon straight honestly
MMA,not_removed,i cant be the only one who is tired of jj can i
MMA,not_removed,im guna buussssttttt
MMA,not_removed,there will be a lot of bullshit talk and lies coming from jones mouth dont believe a word he is looking forward to say about the recent usada case i hope joe goes hard on him but my intuition says otherwise other than that i look greatly forward to this episode since despite all the insanely bad character and bullshit im a huge fan of jones as a fighter and regard having him finally come to the podcast
MMA,not_removed,this is a bad idea on jones part
MMA,not_removed,jon jones is has a girlfriend with or children if he starts openly talking about the dick pills thats the same thing as publicly saying so here is how i cheated on my girl i highly doubt anybody would believe that he would be using pills just to screw his wife and nobody else so i think thats why he is not going to talk about it but joe should still ask him that question
MMA,not_removed,but he used steroids his whole career
MMA,not_removed,jon going to run out of the interview but come back mins later because he forgot his cash
MMA,not_removed,i know i dont have to listen but i dont want this to exist im done giving a shit about jones
MMA,not_removed,oh boy this is either gonna be great or really disappointing
MMA,not_removed,jon jones can eat a dick for all i am concerned he is not bigger than the sport
MMA,not_removed,to lie some more now that hes had more time to make a great story
MMA,not_removed,just go away jon jones youve fucked up more times than oj at this point
MMA,not_removed,sweet hours of compulsive lying im down
MMA,not_removed,getting mad at a commentator for commentary lmao hope nunes starches her again
MMA,not_removed,watch jon show up with an ball or some shit
MMA,not_removed,i used to like jon jones hes a fucking shit bag
MMA,not_removed,breaking news jon jones involved in another dui dead including dana white
MMA,not_removed,hopefully joe has a the same talk with jon as he did with schaub
MMA,not_removed,would be hilarious if joe was setting up jon for a usada raid livestreamed on his podcast
MMA,not_removed,hehehehehehehehehehhehehehehe cries
MMA,not_removed,fortunately dick pills and drugs dont get you banned from jre
MMA,not_removed,i thought you meant literally pull out his dick and say see joe it doesnt work at all
MMA,not_removed,thot i had my shit together boiiiiii aaaaaghhghhghggrhggggrhh
MMA,not_removed,hes lucky he has kids tbf
MMA,not_removed,at this point i feel like the only thing jones wouldnt pull out of is someone elses wife
MMA,not_removed,one thing we know is he doesnt pull out lmao
MMA,not_removed,im a heel heels lie chael sonnen
MMA,not_removed,how dare you
MMA,not_removed,joe better ask him if he really hid under the octagon if he dont no balls
MMA,not_removed,respectfully fuck you
MMA,not_removed,jon do you think im just gonna sit there and let you go on joe rogan experiene
MMA,not_removed,all im sayin is nomsayian
MMA,not_removed,ayy lmao
MMA,not_removed,ganja
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,clear the air as joe clears the bong
MMA,not_removed,the stripped single champ does what the fuck he wants obviously
MMA,not_removed,you know i remember that day i went to court i was pretty bummed with how my life was going but then after i pled guilty to everything i decided to take it as a win because the prosecutors forgot to charge me for not giving a fuck
MMA,not_removed,joe id like to take this chance to apologize to absolutely nobody this would make us like him more
MMA,not_removed,honestly when he flipped and said that just as the second belt arrived i lost my fucking shit
MMA,not_removed,joe id like to take this chance to apologize to absolutely nobody respectfully ftfy
MMA,not_removed,oh god i would completely change my mind about him and become a fan for life if he went that route
MMA,not_removed,love the banter on this sub
MMA,not_removed,if he said that after getting a comeback win to get his belt back that would be gangster jon jones needs to embrace being the heel
MMA,not_removed,you gotta have size reach you gotta bring some attributes or ill rip your whole head off i tell it every time
MMA,not_removed,action bronson style
MMA,not_removed,i guarantee he will run from that discussion like a usada test but seriously i just wish he would confess everything id respect him so much more the last thing i expect from jones is being honest
MMA,not_removed,i really do hope redban is there and asks that mercury fillings question to jon jones
MMA,not_removed,good googly moogly
MMA,not_removed,fear of a black planet cocksuckas
MMA,not_removed,jon jones its either blue cheese with wings or go fuck your mother
MMA,not_removed,i think joey will just get glossy eyed how rogan does should get redban on there
MMA,not_removed,i think this statement is true regardless of the guest
MMA,not_removed,who do you think would win in a wrestling match
MMA,not_removed,yeah joes approach of not an interview but a conversation can cause some issues when people can just spew bullshit and joe has no research done to counter such as the armstrong podcast
MMA,not_removed,well yeah he goes easy on everybody
MMA,not_removed,this is exactly what i fear
MMA,not_removed,all his podcasts are that way i hate when people say that why would he invite someone on the podcast then rip into them no one would come on the show he sets it up like a conversation not an interrogation
MMA,not_removed,i want to hear him talk about the fall of the soviet union would love his analytical take on the events leading up to it
MMA,not_removed,hour podcast with half an hour of spurious brain pill advertising and trying to spell words out for jaime to google search thats hrs of content that should be enough to cover gulf of tonkin the decorticator how high a coyote can jump nibiru all the intricate details of some slapfight joe is having with an egg on twitter boston standup comedy scene in the and a solid minutes of mma discussion
MMA,not_removed,turns on tony bennett
MMA,not_removed,oh shit that was funny source httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvgskxxfrnxo
MMA,not_removed,he transcends
MMA,not_removed,lets hope rogan doesnt act like a pussy and let him make up lies
MMA,not_removed,i hope he mentions his marijuana addiction again like the ariel interview
MMA,not_removed,i just hope joe gives a good hard honest interview joe probably knows a lot more inside details on jons bumpy ride than any of us
MMA,not_removed,not with joe i think podcasts are long and joe wont let bullshit slide and will ask some heavy questions
MMA,not_removed,jon boned jon jones jones
MMA,not_removed,hes called people out before but i think this is more joe giving jon a chance to speak than joe giving himself a chance to grill jon
MMA,not_removed,but hell call people out on their bullshit if he knows enough about the topic to do so
MMA,not_removed,for sure most interesting guest joe has ever had
MMA,not_removed,same here man everyone is all excited for this current drama when in reality its boring as fuck blah blah drug testing blah blah suspension i dont care if he ever fights again but the dude is an mma great ask about his fights
MMA,not_removed,im thinking its either gonna be super juicy and a full hours or jon will get shortgeneric with his answers and the interview will be cut early due to it being boring we will see
MMA,not_removed,i bet he calls dc a pussy
MMA,not_removed,joe is a push over when it comes to a lot of guests watch anyone of his podcasts with tim kennedy he seriously acts like a bitch
MMA,not_removed,its not gonna be special hes gonna put on an act hes just trying to stay relevant while conor takes all the attention
MMA,not_removed,you ever thought maybe he doesnt know who he is dude is still barely in his twenties he became the youngest champ ever and was thrust in the spot light hes obviously got a bunch of religious hang ups that he grew up with juxtaposed against his desire to be a reckless young man and do drugs and chase pussy couple that with an ego that knows he could physically demolish of the population and a shit ton of money to make every stupid fantasy come true this is shit that all of us have to deal with but we dont have to be in the public eye while it happens we also dont have vast resources and yes men which dont help negative behavior not defending anything jon has done but the level of self righteousness that get directed at him from people who have struggled with the same things or would if they were in that situation is ridiculous shove a microphone in your face twice a week when you are and i bet youd say some dumb shit
MMA,not_removed,wouldnt joe be better at asking the tough questions though whats the worst that can happen jon walks out of the interview if anything i think joe will have a better chance of getting jon to open up
MMA,not_removed,lol its and people are still believing chael sonnens stories
MMA,not_removed,usada wasnt even involved in mma when that incident supposedly happened
MMA,not_removed,i stopped watching joes show about a year ago he seriously has turned into a bitch he wont ask tough questions anymore and he upholds fucking bro science half the time i got so sick of his huntingketo diet shit and his keto diet paleo bullshit guests
MMA,not_removed,history tells us it wont
MMA,not_removed,thank you sir
MMA,not_removed,hey jon you feeling sleepy lets go pick up some cocaine you drive
MMA,not_removed,im absolutely sure that given how much he knows about the stuff and how critical of it he has been of peds hes definitely not buying the tainted supplement crap or any other excuses one bit however he does have a show to run and he probably just wants to chat with interesting guests and sometimes that means not going all spanish inquisition on the guests even when they are blatantly full of shit luckily we have ariel for that
MMA,not_removed,nah reformed good christian boy incoming
MMA,not_removed,end of podcast
MMA,not_removed,no way but at least there would be video and audio evidence of the fighter fucking shit up
MMA,not_removed,whats god watch
MMA,not_removed,live on
MMA,not_removed,john jones might lie but hes not the one whos on jre jon jones is the one on jre and hell be the one people are concerned about
MMA,not_removed,fedor doesnt fight till january
MMA,not_removed,but the fans arent that stupid oh but they are
MMA,not_removed,is this even real where the heck is this being confirmed
MMA,not_removed,how is seeing jones full personality possibly going to end up doing good things for him
MMA,not_removed,you know this is reddit right
MMA,not_removed,not op but the link he provided does provide it for me
MMA,not_removed,in the last seconds or so of the audio version where hes naming everyone who is coming on in the next few days i believe its at
MMA,not_removed,to be fair dick pills are used recreationally to keep it up when people are using other party drugsalcohol
MMA,not_removed,i suggest listening to the older ones about present there are some really good ones
MMA,not_removed,probable sociopath tell me more
MMA,not_removed,in the last seconds or so of the audio version where hes naming everyone who is coming on in the next few days i believe its at probably should have included the time in the title
MMA,not_removed,fawning appeasement like with armstrong
MMA,not_removed,apparently not because like it or not jon is goat and most people will still care about what he has to say even if a small minority like you think youve moved on
MMA,not_removed,i hope he goes in on him no holding back
MMA,not_removed,well youre a minority if youre really done then just dont view any of the posts here about him simple as that otherwise you still give a shit enough to follow and disparage him
MMA,not_removed,no way in hell joe said those things because schaub is a personal friend of his no way he oversteps by dropping that shit on jones
MMA,not_removed,fast forward and jon jones hides under joes desk for hours while usada search in the bathroom
MMA,not_removed,why dont you have a seat right over here jon
MMA,not_removed,joe youve been served motherfucker
MMA,not_removed,take a seat john
MMA,not_removed,how funny would it to be watching and joes just sitting casually in his chair while usada agents rush in on the sides to grab jon all while joe says nothing and stares directly into the eyes of jon bones jones
MMA,not_removed,hah well done would be interesting if he does show and get gets high af
MMA,not_removed,in fact theyre sort of a requirement
MMA,not_removed,shit i did too lol
MMA,not_removed,these are not getting old and i love that
MMA,not_removed,his wife must have a helluva closed guard
MMA,not_removed,he just lies at this point im not even sure if his name is chael sonnen
MMA,not_removed,id like jones way more if he just embraced it he can shit talk anyway hes a great fighter the guy has all the attributes to go full heel and rule the fucking world no hes got to act like a good person
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan
MMA,not_removed,i want rogan to call jones out if he starts to have giant holes and inconsistencies in his story of why he got busted and all that bullshit
MMA,not_removed,respectfully that is literally whats going to happen pussy
MMA,not_removed,ive been stripped of more titles than these bums ever even won
MMA,not_removed,the double stripped champ
MMA,not_removed,fook
MMA,not_removed,lights a firecracker
MMA,not_removed,timing was too perfect right when that belt arrived
MMA,not_removed,that moment had everything i loved when he eventually gets both belts on his shoulders thats looks good god bless
MMA,not_removed,he needs to go full heel people love a good guy people love a bad guy nearly everyone hates a bad guy pretending to be a good guy
MMA,not_removed,really by living under the shadow of ufcs biggest star
MMA,not_removed,tips fedora
MMA,not_removed,idk i think most people would shit on him for directly ripping off mcgregors post fight interview
MMA,not_removed,that dude smoked for hours legit non stop joe couldnt keep up
MMA,not_removed,the last thing i expect from jones is being honest have never seen a pro athlete run this much from the truth and i cannot believe he still is
MMA,not_removed,all hopped up on goomy bears
MMA,not_removed,cough weeze cough cough
MMA,not_removed,better pack your lunch fucking momos
MMA,not_removed,i dont want redban anywhere
MMA,not_removed,if there was ever an episode i dont want redban touching its this one and i actually like redban
MMA,not_removed,i just want this to turn into a thorough hour dick pill discussion
MMA,not_removed,i think youd be surprised
MMA,not_removed,if you listen to some of the stuff jones says as far as his usage of oblique kicks its obvious hes a damn savage theres no doubt in my mind that he pokes eyes on purpose some damn good questions though none will be asked
MMA,not_removed,a gift for you
MMA,not_removed,or the dan bilzerian one
MMA,not_removed,how about every podcast unless you arent pro weed then hes got facts for days
MMA,not_removed,i saw the armstrong podcast dont know shit about dude though what was wrong with if
MMA,not_removed,for real this aint investigate journalism he just hangs out with friends and shit its always super biased
MMA,not_removed,hes coming on for a conversation not an interrogation its why high profile guests go on his show
MMA,not_removed,hes not a hard hitting journalist he has peoole on to talk about drugs mma and whatever else they find interesting
MMA,not_removed,the fall of the soviet union to me is just like a story i know called the puppy who lost his way
MMA,not_removed,i dont even know if its that i think hes a guy that likes to party smoke weed and fuck random groupies but since he was raised religious and got engaged young and had kids hes constantly trying to pretend he isnt that guy hes a fuck up thats trying to hold on to the the image of a religious do gooder family man im sure being raised by a pastor puts a ton of pressure on you to be some sort of upstanding good christian man when really all you want to do is fight and snort coke off of strippers im kinda rambling now but im sure you get what im saying
MMA,not_removed,and i cant fucking wait lol say what you want about him hes certainly an interesting human being whether for the right or wrong reasons and listening to him talk for hours will be very interesting hes a difficult guy to entirely work out in terms of intentions and motives and just so happens to be arguably the baddest man on the planet what a podcast
MMA,not_removed,sounds like rmma should have a bingo game
MMA,not_removed,jon bon jovi jones
MMA,not_removed,but he kinda has conflict of interest here he works for ufc and jones is a ufc product uncle dana probably will have him softball some questions but i can definitely see joe drop some juicy shit that he noticed during the interview a couple years down the road as he retires from his ufc responsibilities
MMA,not_removed,not on fighter peds tho he has publicly talked about chad mendes skin cream excuse and said it was legit same with andersons cialis excuse etc i dont know if he actually buys the excuses or if he is just trying to help out the fighters reputation
MMA,not_removed,can confirm im and do dumb stuff
MMA,not_removed,the jon jones circlejerk of hate in this sub kind of happily ignores this but it is the truth nobody here knows what its like to be tempted at jons level or has had to deal with the incredible amount of success and opportunities good or bad jon has had either all while in his early twenties almost all of the people criticizing jon have probably not made as many mistakes as him but they most definitely have not had the chances to fuck up so spectacularly and havent had the public platform to present these mistakes im a big jones fan and was just as pissed as the next guy at all his fiascos especially but im also not naive enough to think i have any idea of the pressures and responsibilities of someone at his level
MMA,not_removed,fantastic point we all forget he was pretty much in the face of the media since he started when people compared him to some of the all time greats couple that with winning the title on short notice and his whole world being changed lets not forget this guy had kids early in his life hes no stranger to adversity the way he behaved in that press conference was not one of a liar i genuinely believe that he took these pills and was embarrassed about it imagine millions of people knowing you could not get it hard and you had to take something its rough man
MMA,not_removed,thrust into the spotlight he became ufc light heavyweight champion at i can name tons of sports stars who have way more of a spotlight than mr jones does and they never acted out or put their sport in a negative light while earning what jon did jon jones will be the next time he is eligible to fight and if he keeps on fucking up his ufc and mma career will be short no one is bigger than the sport
MMA,not_removed,seeing this kind of rationality and empathy on rmma really makes me happy
MMA,not_removed,i dint need any of the things he has to be a dumbass in my and i thought i could demolish of the population does that make me the new interim light heavy weight champ seriously though you arent wrong hopefully joe will have a youd be surprised convo with him and straighten his shit out
MMA,not_removed,yeah but i think theres a better chance of joe being buddy buddy with him talking about how jon is once in human history and shit
MMA,not_removed,when has joe ever asked the tough questions he let an aids denialist talk for an hour and a half on the podcast the only real check being an incredulous bryan callen who was probably even less qualified to challenge him than joe the only time ive ever seen joe challenge someone is when he feels threatened himself
MMA,not_removed,but we will get a more interesting and in depth look at what makes jones jones than if we had a media style interview that questions his recent choices i want to know what it was like for jones growing up i want to know what makes him great i get why he has had a dui i know friends who have gotten duis
MMA,not_removed,this is exactly what i believe as well cause he wouldnt benefit from calling out a bunch of people he likes and is friends with it would just alienate him and make it really hard to get good guests on its the powerful joe rogan experience he gets high talks to interesting people and makes good money for doing that its not mma infowars
MMA,not_removed,thank you im so fucking pumped now lol
MMA,not_removed,what if jamie came at the fighter and sacrificed himself to the fist in order to let joe jump on the back hes a legit black belt most likely better at bjj than a lot of fighters are
MMA,not_removed,much appreciated thank you for this
MMA,not_removed,goes live et pt
MMA,not_removed,if he can own up to his true ass hole self then its better than now im not sure it could get worse
MMA,not_removed,what page does it direct you to it literally just shows me the jordan peterson show
MMA,not_removed,can you link the best ones for us x
MMA,not_removed,i really like the one with action bronson
MMA,not_removed,his performance at the ufc press conference thing dude is nuts
MMA,not_removed,ah ok thanks
MMA,not_removed,i know hes the best etc etc but if you believe a word that comes out of his mouth at this point ive no idea what to tell you so his clearing the air act can piss off
MMA,not_removed,wish i could but i like to hate
MMA,not_removed,its a joke guys
MMA,not_removed,with his slenderman legs sticking out
MMA,not_removed,joe knocks on his desk and whispers pssst pussy you still there
MMA,not_removed,i see jon hiding under the desk
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,it would probably help a lot
MMA,not_removed,that would conflict with his christian beliefs
MMA,not_removed,redban is the king of boner pills
MMA,not_removed,every time i think its outlived its status a new one pops up that makes me smile one more time
MMA,not_removed,before the pills she was having to resort to mounted triangle
MMA,not_removed,its michael sonnen
MMA,not_removed,what kind of name is chael anyway
MMA,not_removed,i mean i feel like he wants to be a good guy i do find his words annoying when hes clearly not living the way hes speaking but im not gonna hate on the guy for speaking positively and optimistically in the public eye gotta start somewhere
MMA,not_removed,i would argue that the scummy fakegood act is what makes him true heel like when he came out and thanked usada for clearing him of any wrongdoing the cheek
MMA,not_removed,idk man i feel like he is embracing the heel aspect more ever since the first dc fight he doesnt seem anywhere as near to the fake nice guy he used to portray
MMA,not_removed,why you counting my nomsayins nomsayin what are you taking a nomcensus
MMA,not_removed,thats actually a pretty good comeback
MMA,not_removed,it will take a whole fookin army to take this belt off meagain
MMA,not_removed,nobody else has done that in the history of the ufc
MMA,not_removed,making history
MMA,not_removed,rogan almost fucked it up by talking during that pause
MMA,not_removed,mma already has a full heel in conor
MMA,not_removed,very true
MMA,not_removed,who could why would you want to
MMA,not_removed,aaaaaaaahhhhhaaaaahahaaaaaaaa cough hargh ha hhaaa cough hahahaha
MMA,not_removed,rogan yeah man its a horrible thing that happened last week regarding this serious topic redban i wonder if hippos likejizz more than a rhino because ive been with a girl who said she was with a hippo once and she believed so
MMA,not_removed,explain pokÃ©mon go to me joe its this game that uses your camera to take pictures of your house for the government to archive redban uhhhhh you lost me redban very odd guy
MMA,not_removed,best move ever when redban was taken off production duties the podcast had moved onto a semi serious guest show and he would wilfully fuck things up and drag the conversation off topic
MMA,not_removed,idk i thought redban stops them from getting deeper but really joe just ends up repeating himself having him there as comedic relief gets them to change up the topic before they get stale
MMA,not_removed,so redban doesnt get in the way of the serious questions rogans going to be softballing to jj at least if redbans there him and jj can exchange some fun cocaine stories
MMA,not_removed,i think youd be surprised i think he would fuck you up
MMA,not_removed,i think youoh fuck it
MMA,not_removed,a gift for you
MMA,not_removed,jon jones has a capacity for violence thats just so natural its not just his body but hes mentally a born killer
MMA,not_removed,can you elaborate
MMA,not_removed,and that makes it all a better fit for people we wouldnt rather see raked
MMA,not_removed,theres a huge spectrum between a buttered up photoshoppedforamagazine conversation and a decently informative interview
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,ill have to give that one a shot
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,most relevant comment in this whole thread
MMA,not_removed,nah bro dont be reasonable jon jones is the devil
MMA,not_removed,i know he wont but i hope joe grills him on all his bullshit i hope we see jones true colors on display in an undeniable fashion so i can stop listening to jones fans whine about how im just a hater and that he deserves the benefit of the doubt the amount of people that still blindly defend him is stunning i have to imagine they havent been there for all the years of him blithely making himself out to be a victim over and over again
MMA,not_removed,jeffrey dahmer was also an interesting human being
MMA,not_removed,for someone who prides himself on his skepticism and critical thinking skills joe can be pretty goddamn gullible
MMA,not_removed,i think he does this for fighters reputations cause hes nice guy imo like he does promoting some comedians who just arent really funny ive seen on some podcasts where hell go into great detail about peds with non mma guests and then play dumb mispronouncin words intentionally when hes got a fighter on
MMA,not_removed,you think you have to be a superstar to drive drunk crash into shit then run off i know plenty of poor fuckers who do the same shit they just dont have lawyers good enough to keep them out of jail stop cutting a guy who deserves and needs no slack so much slack hes a tool he continually makes the same mistakes once is an accident this many times is a chosen pattern and he deserves to be called out on it
MMA,not_removed,no doing drugs and hookers is not what we hate him for we hate his hypocrisy and we hate his cheating and his overall general behavior he fucking hit someone in his car and fled the scene
MMA,not_removed,fighting is different mike tyson is another example of loose cannon goat
MMA,not_removed,conor is
MMA,not_removed,see thats exactly how joe should start off make jon feel comfortable like hes among
MMA,not_removed,theres a reason why this dude talks to guests for longer than hours stretches and still remains relevant and entertaining im sorry but i just dont see how walking with jon jones by the rio grande bosque is going to get him to open up about his life and the poor decisions hes made joe has openly said that jon jones is both one of the most gifted mma athletes and also a complete screw up before i think jones challenging rogans patience and capacity for empathy by denying or skirting questions just wont end well for jones if he wants to come clean jre is probably one of the best places to do it not walking by the bosque and not sandwiched between chael sonnen and ric flair on the mma hour my cents
MMA,not_removed,jaime would go flying like that other guy who tried to stop jones from getting at dc
MMA,not_removed,pretty sure its just straight bullshit man welcome to reddit i guess
MMA,not_removed,and when he gets thirsty joe will tell him to drink his own piss its no big deal ive done it its not that bad
MMA,not_removed,fighting is the antithesis of prayer
MMA,not_removed,rhino represent
MMA,not_removed,thought it still made you smile boiiiii aaaaaaahhhhghhhghhgghhghh
MMA,not_removed,thought it outlived its status boiiiiii aaaaaghhghhghggrhggggrhh
MMA,not_removed,you from the department of nomsayins
MMA,not_removed,more like itll take a whole fucking army to keep the belt on him
MMA,not_removed,a whole fookin army aka albuquerque police
MMA,not_removed,again
MMA,not_removed,conors an act though jon is a legitimate asshole id love for him to go full hell and stop giving a fuck hes at his best when that side of him slips out
MMA,not_removed,not a heel hes basically cm punkstone cold during their title run beloved by the audience but he is only an asshole to the company everyone is gonna hate jones if he goes heelish because he is a criminal
MMA,not_removed,snoop
MMA,not_removed,any chronic smoker can do it its just a waste of money if you arent rich and time consuming and extra wear and tear on your lungs for no benefit you become very tolerant to weed very quickly and its not like the more you smoke the higher you get
MMA,not_removed,yeah ive never been able to just smoke nonstop its like i cease to exist after a certain point and i really hate the way it makes me feel like a fake human like not like wow youre two faced but like im not real and everything is make believe
MMA,not_removed,jon which boner pill do you recommend god damn it redban you promised
MMA,not_removed,i love that stupid shitthen joed go off the rails and scold him then get upset that he made him lose his train of thoughthilarious
MMA,not_removed,he could ask jon if hes ever considered getting lead fillings to be heavier
MMA,not_removed,its nice when he is the guest now though dont get all the hate hes basically the latest reddit content on jre nowadays
MMA,not_removed,but hes not funny and hes terribly stupid to go along with it
MMA,not_removed,just seems like jones takes himself very seriously despite being a ridiculous individual and it would be an awkward juxtaposition
MMA,not_removed,your driving skills are not elite
MMA,not_removed,one of the most brutal disagreements i can remember but the very best thing that happened to schuab
MMA,not_removed,great find that stupid smirk on his face as he brags about itwhat a douche
MMA,not_removed,hes not a self made millionaire he comes from a very well off family
MMA,not_removed,joes true gift is the ability to keep a conversation flowing seemingly endlessly i bet very few people could put out hour podcasts consistently
MMA,not_removed,i think joe is of above average intelligence the fact he has so many experts in so many different fields on as guests kind of makes him seem uneducated in conversation sometimes he has to be a jack of all trades which makes him a master of none very few people can hold there own in so many different fields like joe does
MMA,not_removed,yeah i mean hes certainly devious and manipulative to some extent i just wonder how much maybe this podcast will provide a bit more insight into that i obviously dont expect him to directly come out and expose himself or anything but a hour conversation can often be revealing
MMA,not_removed,as a huge jones fan i dont even defend him anymore i find him enjoyable as a fighter but not a great person hes almost like kanye to me i like the music but he himself is a weird motherfucker
MMA,not_removed,jones is one of the greatest fighters of all time joe will lap up of his bullshit
MMA,not_removed,i want to see him burn too but damn joes going to go easy on him i doubt we get any real answers on the past just bullshit promises about the future
MMA,not_removed,exactly
MMA,not_removed,yeah for the right or wrong reasons
MMA,not_removed,whos to say rogan wouldnt have dahmer on
MMA,not_removed,what about his ronda interviews he is borderline edmund levels of sycophantism he cant be confrontational
MMA,not_removed,he really buys into any scientist that comes in saying that have new information but the establishment just doesnt want to accept it then joe just buys into whatever they say and rips on academia even tho academia would probably completely accept these peoples theories if they had significant evidence
MMA,not_removed,like i said the level of temptation is whats different just some everyday guy cheating on his wife sleeping around with a bunch of women is different than tiger woods sleeping around with a bunch women women were flocking towards woods because hes a celebrity and he probably felt unbeatable he was much more tempted to do that than anything a regular guy could ever feel same with jones hes a huge star has plenty of money drugs fast cars these things came to him as a result of being successful also as skeletonrock said being the youngest undefeated ufc champion at has to do something unimaginable to your ego he probably felt like the king of the fucking planet all at an incredibly young age where people are often rambunctious and most people dont even know who they are yet all those factors combined your buddy going on a bender and then driving drunk and committing a hitandrun is hugely different than jon jones doing it for someone like jones its just so much easier im also not saying to cut him some slack or trying to undermine his crimes all im saying is that people shouldnt act selfrighteous and allknowing because they dont know they probably never will
MMA,not_removed,dont forget our good friend floyd
MMA,not_removed,thats onnit i am sure boner pills are in the preliminary stages for their supplements section
MMA,not_removed,i thought it was hilarious when he smiled and admitted to calling dc a pussy
MMA,not_removed,antiheroes and ya jones wouldnt be an antihero he would be fullblown asshole i disagree about everyone hating him though lots of people like to cheer for the asshole just look at the last election
MMA,not_removed,true
MMA,not_removed,or his cousin wiz
MMA,not_removed,can we please get him on the show i think ive listened to just about every jre but dont think this has happened snoop is a ufc fan to boot
MMA,not_removed,cheech and chong too
MMA,not_removed,good answer but the why still remains
MMA,not_removed,this no one else must smoke daily
MMA,not_removed,joe really does treat him like shit though and that is on live stream
MMA,not_removed,huh well then i guess were on two different wavelengths or i just have the maturity of a year old but i think hes usually pretty hilarious
MMA,not_removed,redban brings light heartedness and is a bullshit detector idk if hes good for this jj episode but i think he wouldve been perfect for the bilzerian podcast
MMA,not_removed,and his dad did some shady shit to get the money theyhe has
MMA,not_removed,im actually pretty amazed at how much random shit he can speak about and he comes to good conclusions and seems to grasp the essence of what people are talking about hes pretty smart and well educated about a variety of topics
MMA,not_removed,i dont think hes really faking anything though at least not on fundamental level people talk about the real jon jones but were getting the real jon jones he is exactly what he shows in the public a disingenuous manipulative piece of shit but he genuinely seems to think hes a good person and that hes always in the right i dont think its an act he sees himself as a truly good and virtuous person that occasionally makes innocent mistakes and is unfairly judged for them i find it sickening honestly jones fans call me stuck up and say who are you to judge
MMA,not_removed,i honestly wish i could understand this jones seems like a real person to me a real person who is given unimaginable temptationmore than any of us regular people could imagine and then makes mistakes these mistakes are grand but so is the temptation that comes with fame money and notoriety of that magnitude i dont see myself doing much better if given that at such a young age
MMA,not_removed,if he could get dahmer on i would tune in
MMA,not_removed,hes a conspiracy theorist that makes himself look reasonable by surrounding himself with way nuttier and dumber conspiracy theorists i actually liked him and his podcast for a while but hes been going off the deep end for a while now building a cult of personality around himself where people tend not to question anything he says it kind of sucks to see because there was a period where he seemed fairly reasonable to me
MMA,not_removed,snoop might be down for it we should bombard his twitter
MMA,not_removed,holy fuck why hasnt he been on
MMA,not_removed,uherecomestheking pretty please
MMA,not_removed,weve all got a friend like brian
MMA,not_removed,its always warranted though redban could easily just not fucked with the flow of conversation or not say the stupid things he says
MMA,not_removed,oh for sure im a fan of having him on more often i like him he just doesnt pair well with people who are trying to be serious
MMA,not_removed,he sees himself as a truly good and virtuous person that occasionally makes innocent mistakes and is unfairly judged for them i find it sickening honestly that seems like a narcissistic quality for sure i dont think hes really faking anything though at least not on fundamental level people talk about the real jon jones but were getting the real jon jones he is exactly what he shows in the public i agree that a fair amount of this is visible but a lot past that is up to the individuals judgement there have been many fighters that know him that have said that the public dont even know the half of it now what about what they dont know about either i get a certain vibe from jon i really wonder about i wonder what hes capable of i dont claim to know or anything i just hope i can get a few more answers from this podcast
MMA,not_removed,uherecomestheking you wanna do the joe rogan podcast sometime
MMA,not_removed,lets go champ
MMA,not_removed,friend
MMA,not_removed,who we see less and less of as the years go by
MMA,not_removed,with serious guests i feel the good outweighs the bad with having redban there he would normally melt into the background and add some silly stuff at opportune points and keep it going if it works or become mute if it didnt thats how he was in the past i feel the melissa ethridge episode is an example of this this jj episode isnt going to be one of those of serious podcasts anyway itll probably be banter seriousness and straight coke talk as most of them are would be cool if everyone was on coke like how the duncan one they were on acid a man can dream
MMA,not_removed,fair enough he definitely has a public and private face he puts on as i said hes a sociopath or to be accurate displays sociopathic tendencies and like i think youre saying i imagine hes capable of much worse than hes actually been caught doing
MMA,not_removed,another armchair psychologist throwing the word sociopath this ought to be interesting
MMA,not_removed,reminds me a lot of tiger woods
MMA,not_removed,signed to fight punk yet
MMA,not_removed,still trying to get that fight im hearing possible chicago but who knows
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,best bromance in all of mma next to cain and dc
MMA,not_removed,such a succulent bromance of two guys from opposing camps reminds me of romeo and juliet
MMA,not_removed,fabermcgregor is the official ship of rmma
MMA,not_removed,god i love the relationship between these two
MMA,not_removed,whats going on here are we going to grapple i think were going to grapple no wait no he just wants to hug okay then go for it conor its okay
MMA,not_removed,does anybody have a clip of them when faber says his head looks like a cantaloupe then conor says what da fook is a cantaloupe haha shit was so funny
MMA,not_removed,samba
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor has a boner here
MMA,not_removed,faber had good wrist control during the embrace
MMA,not_removed,they have the funniest relationship
MMA,not_removed,when she want a hug but you digging for underhooks
MMA,not_removed,it looks like they are battling for who gets the alpha arm overtop sort of like that vid of world leaders insisting on being the last to enter a room
MMA,not_removed,so much sexual tension between these two i wonder how things would have played out had there been no dee in conors life
MMA,not_removed,kith
MMA,not_removed,how tall is faber i dont believe hes
MMA,not_removed,putting your arms on the outside is a body language display of dominance faber tried to assert dominance at first but mcgregors arm immediately goes for the counter and tries to take the outside position urijah of course doesnt allow this so instead of turning a hug into a grappling match they opted for a tie an awkward tie which conor actually sneakily ends up winning by having his arm higher in the back position urijahs got his on conors lower back and conors has his around urijahs neck and shoulders
MMA,not_removed,faber is amazed at how big he is
MMA,not_removed,it was pretty clear they actually liked each other
MMA,not_removed,but did he hug bale
MMA,not_removed,this warms my little heart
MMA,not_removed,at the end of the day they just wanna fuck
MMA,not_removed,what is awkward about it
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor was clearly intimidated here a top mma official rumoured faber to be weighing in at before this exchange
MMA,not_removed,lol i remember thinking why is he so upset
MMA,not_removed,reminds me of frank underwood when hes suffering through a political disaster
MMA,not_removed,i remember this comment someone made here when youre in the car with your mom and she drives through mcdonalds
MMA,not_removed,i knew exactly what this gif would be after watching that clip lol
MMA,not_removed,nah conorartem is number hahaha its beautiful artemmm
MMA,not_removed,you broke a perfectly good pair of sunglasses i could have used those sunglasses
MMA,not_removed,id been looking for this just a couple of days ago thanks for posting
MMA,not_removed,the way mcgregor described his guy kinda reminded me of the first nate fight lol
MMA,not_removed,im a caindc gal myself or maybe conorartem theres real love going on between those guys
MMA,not_removed,i always dig for underhooks when i hug somebody is is that weird
MMA,not_removed,yeah or when conors says faber should go up to the octagon and shake his chin because they didnt saw any ringgirls and conorfaber and dana just laughing their asses off
MMA,not_removed,he shouldve asked if it was anything like a gazelle
MMA,not_removed,was because of that clip that i learnt what a cantaloupe was its a rockmelon in case my commonwealth brethren are wondering
MMA,not_removed,boner pills man everyone is taking them
MMA,not_removed,some people hug and then some people control the wrist and pummel for underhooks
MMA,not_removed,its funny because faber is quite a bit older than conor conor watched faber fights as a teenager
MMA,not_removed,my ex hated that i insisted on getting proper head position in the clinch
MMA,not_removed,between conor and urijah who would be cam and who would be mitch
MMA,not_removed,looks easily inches shorter than mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,conor is in his head embrace
MMA,not_removed,thanks for the breakdown rener
MMA,not_removed,do you usually go for wrist control when you hug people
MMA,not_removed,only mcgregor definitely wouldnt have been intimidated i mean lets be fair nate was what
MMA,not_removed,competitive people are usually competitive in everything they do its a big reason for how these guys get so good
MMA,not_removed,any guy who played dodge ball for gym class in high school knows the feeling you can start off saying you dont care and its whatever but the second you get hit you declare war on that kids entire bloodline
MMA,not_removed,i love how he just vaults into the cage to give artem a hug makes me smile every time i see it
MMA,not_removed,i made this gif a few weeks ago and forgot about it
MMA,not_removed,when conor kissed artem on the cheek after artem lost the qualifying fight too much feels
MMA,not_removed,they match my flip flops so good
MMA,not_removed,not at all conor shot because he was rocked and gassed
MMA,not_removed,how
MMA,not_removed,dcrockhold probably more so than dccain the videos of luke and dc ribbing each other are great
MMA,not_removed,i personally like faberconor more because theyre not teammatestraining partners
MMA,not_removed,connor saying faber looks like a retired skateboarder was great too
MMA,not_removed,haha it didnt even occur to me that other countries didnt also have it his general curiosity about it was so funny
MMA,not_removed,underhooks
MMA,not_removed,well i mean its more that they are being a bit touchy i wouldnt put it as awkward
MMA,not_removed,they dont want you to win dom they dont want you to win
MMA,not_removed,nobody likes losing but some people can take it way too far i know of someone who has to get to the gate of his flight first we were at the airport hours before our boarding time it was a hour flight
MMA,not_removed,im competitive as fuck paper rock scissors you better believe were playing until i beat you more than you beat me
MMA,not_removed,thats how michael jordan is from what i hear but if you have something to say he will listen cocky as fuck on the court but had an endless amount of humility i think thats how conor is
MMA,not_removed,can confirm i find it absolutely impossible to stop being competitive even when my goal is just to chill out with friends it just doesnt happen
MMA,not_removed,awww heart strings plucked
MMA,not_removed,i dont know
MMA,not_removed,at least one arm in
MMA,not_removed,always be ready to sprawl n brawl
MMA,not_removed,agree imo this is far from awkward i would even go as far as saying that this is the opposite of a awkward interaction
MMA,not_removed,now thats just mild mental illness
MMA,not_removed,this is insanity because getting to the gate first is a loss the winner is the last person to get to the gate that still gets on the flight this may not apply if you are on one of those weirdo airlines that doesnt have reserved seating
MMA,not_removed,fuck that dude youre a friend for even going along with that shit i would have just met up with him later
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats not competition he doesnt get something for being first in that situation
MMA,not_removed,yeah i think its that they understand thatin order to beor remain the bestyou have to be capable of taking parts of other peoples games that are better than yours and to be able to accept knowledge from others its why kobe never hid that he took moves from mj or dr j its why conor stays in the gym and trusts what coach kav tells him
MMA,not_removed,im the most relaxed
MMA,not_removed,please tell us about your great achievements in life
MMA,not_removed,do you get into a competitive talking match with them
MMA,not_removed,you definitely lost this one via downvote
MMA,not_removed,is daisy some irish slang for good friend
MMA,not_removed,broke back octagaon
MMA,not_removed,you know what they say genius is just crazy until you get diagnosed with extreme ocd
MMA,not_removed,if you dont have any checked in baggage it does mean you could he bumped to an earlier flight
MMA,not_removed,ive been that person before the plane couldve left the gate minutes ahead of schedule but i decided to make sure that didnt happen
MMA,not_removed,tell me about it i like getting to the airport late enough that its boarding by the time i get to the gate i was bored out of my mind
MMA,not_removed,httpmimgurcomgalleryfwgxg
MMA,not_removed,you guys are so weird like do you think im somehow bragging
MMA,not_removed,like downvotes or upvotes mean absolutely anything buddy
MMA,not_removed,ive never heard it before im from the other side of the country though could be a dublin thing
MMA,not_removed,you little daisy is a way of showing happiness when things go your way ie you win on a big bet youd say something to the effect of get in there you little daisy
MMA,not_removed,i love the look on cains face at the end of this looks like a man plotting revenge on jones for breaking his boy
MMA,not_removed,broke back aka sounds about right
MMA,not_removed,but then he wouldnt be first man
MMA,not_removed,youre a hero
MMA,not_removed,if youre so super competitive that you cant even chill with friends then you should already be a high achiever in life
MMA,not_removed,being competitive is very rarely seen as a negative trait a lot of times its considered a winners mentality so i could see where hes coming from
MMA,not_removed,but i thought you were competitive no matter the occasion because beating your friends at a game of football or beer pong doesnt mean much either
MMA,not_removed,furious bear
MMA,not_removed,thats not how it works im very competitive in most things i do even if i suck at those things
MMA,not_removed,im just saying its in my nature to be competitive im sure a lot of people can relate why has this annoyed you so much
MMA,not_removed,fuckin strange people on reddit man
MMA,not_removed,how all i did was poke a hole in your logic
MMA,not_removed,god you are trying so hard
MMA,not_removed,take it easy man its just reddit remember the upvotes and downvotes dont mean anything you competitive person you
MMA,not_removed,you ok
MMA,not_removed,do worry about other people just do you fam there are a ton of keyboard warriors who act like they could ko conor but there are also a ton of people who try to help and teach newbies so dont sweat it just do you
MMA,not_removed,fight firm is legit there is a good muay thai place near you as well let me call someone and get the name avoid daddis
MMA,not_removed,balance studios is a great bjj place dont know much about their muay thai classes though
MMA,not_removed,right outside of the city is precision jiu jitsu and cassidy brother muay thai is a floor below its closer to kop but an awesome place
MMA,not_removed,thanks man let me know whats up with daddis
MMA,not_removed,yeah id like to know whats up with daddis ive only ever rolled with a few of their guys and they seemed alright
MMA,not_removed,its a money making operation they had a decent stable of local fighters a few years ago but the owner drove them out
MMA,not_removed,stay fly muay thai ive heard good things about body arts as well but dont know anyone who has trained there
MMA,not_removed,there was a mass exodus about years ago it might have recovered i moved out of philly about a year ago i had some good friends who worked there and trained there and they all got dicked over by the want to be navy seal owner
MMA,not_removed,oh no he dead
MMA,not_removed,god damn i know the guy getting koed here still sucks to see it
MMA,not_removed,i remember stitch saying if someone is knocked out like that you should keep the mouth piece in edit stitch said as long as the guy is still breathing leave the mouth piece in
MMA,not_removed,yes repost doesnt matter tho
MMA,not_removed,that will always be impressive no matter how many times i see it
MMA,not_removed,rumble johnson would be proud of that mans blacksplosiveness
MMA,not_removed,murder
MMA,not_removed,simon phoenix is back
MMA,not_removed,thats a pretty wizardly and clever move ie use the first kick to provoke a reaction then follow it with another when the opponent is pausing for a halfbeat i guess its kind of the jabjab idea i wonder how many prominent fighters like to do this kind of thing
MMA,not_removed,if thats who i think it is the guy that got knocked out is davad evans dude was a beast of a wrestler back in our high school days constantly plagued by injuries but a beast none the other heard he was doing mma i hope he comes back from this
MMA,not_removed,oh were doing spinning shit now
MMA,not_removed,jesus that kick was like from jeanclaude van damme movie brutal
MMA,not_removed,thats good
MMA,not_removed,what weight division is this
MMA,not_removed,well thats one way to learn about lateral movement
MMA,not_removed,so much deadlier than the spinning bird kick
MMA,not_removed,damnnnnnnn he got ktfo
MMA,not_removed,sorry adam
MMA,not_removed,sometimes i want to be an athlete and then i put down the box of donuts and watch this gif and then i dont want to be an athlete anymore
MMA,not_removed,does the cornerman rushing in have sugartitson his back
MMA,not_removed,it looked like he lagged then took the hit a second later hahahah
MMA,not_removed,that second kick was almost impossible to dodge unless he dodge out of habit it was extremely quick even when you watch it many times and know its coming from that position on the wall there was really no place that guy could go he wasnt going to drop down he couldve had a chance if there wasnt a wall there
MMA,not_removed,can someone tell me of this is true i heard somewhere that shamrock fc is a direct feeder to i think it was bellator
MMA,not_removed,tale of the tape and a bit of foreshadowing by the announcer starts at fight starts at with the knockout following not too long after
MMA,not_removed,timbeeeeeeerrrrrrr
MMA,not_removed,mmmmmsugarfire
MMA,not_removed,daaaamn looks for a second like he had a tbi the wrists being flexed out like that happens with cerebral and brain stem injuries httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiabnormalposturing
MMA,not_removed,good finally a ref stopping the fight before the follow up punches
MMA,not_removed,he way ded
MMA,not_removed,he sleep
MMA,not_removed,hard to tell he wasnt wearing shoes
MMA,not_removed,is he part spaghetti
MMA,not_removed,its all in the game though he knows it rare to build a highlight reel without having a cameo on someone elses do you livetrain in the kc area as far as i know thats where shamrock tends to operate i could be wrong though
MMA,not_removed,is he okay did this break is jaw or anything
MMA,not_removed,its all about the tongue covering the airway probably they take it out to get better vision with the mouth guard out in a first responderfirst aid situation you are taught to simply check the breathing by listening or seeing chest rising so yeah i dont agree with taking it out
MMA,not_removed,does he say why
MMA,not_removed,glad it is im here every day and ive never seen it
MMA,not_removed,its more common to do a roundhouse kick into a spinning backfist
MMA,not_removed,it gets to a way higher level than strikes go have a look at robin blacks breakdowns they will blow your mind
MMA,not_removed,i think he was trying to land the high kick but followed up with the spin when his kick missed clean allowing his momentum to carry through
MMA,not_removed,that is david evans hes got another fight coming up in a few weeks i believe
MMA,not_removed,im not sure what delay you think you see
MMA,not_removed,and the inside of a hospital
MMA,not_removed,it says sugarfire its a fairly popular bbq place in st louis
MMA,not_removed,yeah it looked like he did the fencing response ouch
MMA,not_removed,go forward young friend riamverystrong needs you
MMA,not_removed,liek so ded
MMA,not_removed,knees weak arms are heavy
MMA,not_removed,isnt that what he just said
MMA,not_removed,httpsgiantgfycatcomdensefeistygoawebm
MMA,not_removed,in this situation they are more concerned with clearing the airway in paramedic level training where i live clearing the airway is the first priority in an emergency situation i think it definitely depends on the training level of the responder the high your training the more likely you will want the mouthpiece out because you have interventions you can use if needed that require a clear airway
MMA,not_removed,i havent seen this interview in months so i kind of misquoted but stitch said as long as the guy is breathing to leave the mouth piece in
MMA,not_removed,some people hate reposts i dont if its cool as fuck why not see it again and why not share it with people who havent seen it yet or if you dont give a shit how hard is it to ignore it sure it gets tiresome on occasion to see that steve buscemi did and pretended to be a firefighter so he could search the rubble and finish the job which scared martha stewert whom he was dating at the time to dump him id rather see rampage slam arona into another dimension than an ambiguous conor tweet but hey maybe thats just me
MMA,not_removed,same its new to me anyways
MMA,not_removed,which at this point is more a deterrent than a counter
MMA,not_removed,thats because most fighters couldnt kick that fast with that much power
MMA,not_removed,i havent heard of him i do tend to follow jack slacks and conner ruebuschs stuff feel free to link me to a good example of blacks stuff and thanks in advance
MMA,not_removed,many trauma such ded wow
MMA,not_removed,oh shit im spaghetti
MMA,not_removed,because hes shitposting
MMA,not_removed,thanks for the link
MMA,not_removed,those two are already much better analysts than robin reddit just likes robin because he shouts a lot and makes up words
MMA,not_removed,it sucked the first time it still does
MMA,not_removed,wtf
MMA,not_removed,wat
MMA,not_removed,do you really think youre getting downvoted because people are silly
MMA,not_removed,youre being downvoted for acting like a tool shitposting and for not understanding something as simple as i know that guy it still sucks to see him get hurt not only that but youre being very persistent and you think youre making a strong argument even tho someone tried to respectfully clarify this is what i saw
MMA,not_removed,the ironic part is you did not discover them you heard of them due to a conversation about robin black where they were mentioned ive been listening to the heavy hands pocast for at least a year and ive been following ruebusch on twitter for much longer than that but youre free to believe that no one on rmma actually knows anything about mma besides i learned about jack slack from boxing
MMA,not_removed,you seem to be the only person who didnt get it
MMA,not_removed,you dont even know who youre talking to
MMA,not_removed,you clearly are though
MMA,not_removed,still as in today as much as when i first saw it seems pretty obvious to me
MMA,not_removed,how can you confuse that sentence or even the first one and then comment on other peoples grasp on the english language
MMA,not_removed,dude youre a belligerent moron and id say deleting your previous comment goes further to creating confusion or is there a reason you did that
MMA,not_removed,they said i know this guy still sucks to see it because it sucked once and still sucks i just dont know how else to see it
MMA,not_removed,ffs bro
MMA,not_removed,cmon man i was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt
MMA,not_removed,knowing them personally you dork
MMA,not_removed,didnt see anything worth answering
MMA,not_removed,looks like he is the new english cricket teams wicket keeper
MMA,not_removed,for those interested in what youre actually seeing here this isnt some type of heat or cold therapy its using compressed air to massage the leg muscles
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwinstagramcompbgdsigpstvf may at utc httpiimgurcombdlhjhwjpg do you like my new tracksuit bottoms i got them from marty mcfly haha ryanlparsons lent me this ntrecovery recovery system pretty awesome between this and myproteinuk im sorted i am bot for bugssuggestionsfeedback httpsnpredditcommessagecomposetobestmeampsubjectinstagrammirrorhttpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,really theyre just like extra tight running pants
MMA,not_removed,yeah it was kind of discouraging seeing all the shit people were flinging at her on here i mean this is the place that should understand what she did for wmma
MMA,not_removed,royce gracie went out getting pummeled by matt hughes too mma is a sport that eats its pioneers credit to nunes shes the better fighter today
MMA,not_removed,okay but lets admire the technique of nunes shots ronda got worked tonight
MMA,not_removed,i will agree with a lot of people here on one thing ufc fucked themselves over by promoting ronda as a once in a lifetime right before she got beat by holm they made it so in terms of the mainstream media at least for a long time if its not ronda they dont give a shit about the champion
MMA,not_removed,you are going to concert
MMA,not_removed,id still favor ronda over most tbh her rise and fall isnt that different than a lot of other fighters just look at weidman he rose up undefeated and dominated everyone but now hes been finished twice hes still a boss but evolution is needed
MMA,not_removed,agreed she helped build the division
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,if this is the end im glad ronda nut huggers will disappear
MMA,not_removed,not gonna lie ronda vs cm punk would be interesting to watch not sure who would win
MMA,not_removed,thank the easy to get overhyped fanbase without them they would have never brought womens mma to the ufc sidenote the womens division did not exist before ronda so youre thanking her for something she had no part in if anything thank amanda for destroying her so there hopefully will still be some attention focused on the championship going forward postpost ronda
MMA,not_removed,they do they also understand that she isnt very likable either
MMA,not_removed,wmma was going to evolve with or without her look how much the competition level has been raised just in the last years people thought was ronda just that good when nobody else can keep the belt and the answer is no everyone else just got better and she stayed the same
MMA,not_removed,yeah and theres a lot more to come shes been cocky and acted shitty in the past but no one deserves the level of criticism and ridicule that shes been going through and will continue to go through after this i hope she can get through this quickly
MMA,not_removed,we do doesnt make the loss any less embarrassing though it was just so bad by any standard besides you are reading comment not more than half an hour after a fight naturally most will be reactionary
MMA,not_removed,im guilty of slinging some dirt her way with that being said her contribution to bringing wmma to the ufc and bringing it to a lot of people that may have never thought of even watching mma should not be under looked
MMA,not_removed,what did she actually do though really win some fights via armbar and let the media spin her into something shes not all the while making huge money from it uhhanyone would do that shes not some special person she just happened to be the person the ufc picked
MMA,not_removed,yeah she destroyed ronda
MMA,not_removed,not ignoring it at all but again this womens division most likely wouldnt have still been here without rousey so if shes retiring she deserves some recognition
MMA,not_removed,i mean did they really fuck up she got fucking massive before that fight if she had won it would have been unreal but even with the loss theyre making a killing off her
MMA,not_removed,i think it would be much smaller though the ratings most likely wouldnt have been nearly as high without her
MMA,not_removed,just look at weidman he rose up undefeated and dominated everyone but now hes been finished twice apples and oranges man getting finished is putting it mildly she just stood still
MMA,not_removed,dude this isnt the youtube comment section relax
MMA,not_removed,danas wallet
MMA,not_removed,they would run at each other head first and knock heads double ko
MMA,not_removed,id give the edge to ronda because the fight will most likely be a grappling bout punk will try to use his man strength to overpower her but like any white belt eventually theyll get tied up tired or get confused and leave an arm or leg out as long as ronda can stay calm in the grappling exchange she can establish a dominant position over any bjj white belt
MMA,not_removed,how because she set the bar too high for other fighters in terms of marketing i can agree but blame the ufc not rousey herself
MMA,not_removed,the ratings wouldnt have been there and theres a high chance that even if it was brought in it wouldve been cancelled
MMA,not_removed,to who though women and casual male observers like myself enjoyed her
MMA,not_removed,everyone else is three fighters
MMA,not_removed,lol you know nothing jon snow
MMA,not_removed,what a ridiculous comment anyone could consistently finish opponents as a title holder in under thirty seconds then why has no one else in the history of the sport had a similar run
MMA,not_removed,she should face the media if this is it imo
MMA,not_removed,what proof do you have of that
MMA,not_removed,not to mention chris went to the post fight presser with wonderboy and joked about his loss rousey hid for a full year
MMA,not_removed,i mean youd have to think hed win bc hes a man height size and strength advantage but bc neither of them can box and shes so dominant in bjj i legit think she could win bc he wouldnt be able to leverage his advantages not that any of my theorizing matters in the least
MMA,not_removed,its sad how many people would eat that shit up for eitheror and not the japanese style freakshow fight it would be
MMA,not_removed,you sound as delusional as ronda listen to outside opinion sometime the last thing the ufc ever needed was to follow along the paths of boxing and wwe and thats exactly what theyve been doing as of late and with people such as ronda
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about you just answered or replied to something i didnt ask or state
MMA,not_removed,the non casual observers
MMA,not_removed,as you pointed out to those who arent casual observers of her theyd be calling her out all the same for who she is if she were a top male in the sport hate she gets goes far beyond being a woman its her as a person just as many show hate toward conor for how he talks to sell fights sports are love hate youre either or most times in who you chose to root for or against
MMA,not_removed,as someone coming from rall this is anecdotal but i only tuned into wmma because ronda was this sensation that i had been hearing about i didnt care about it beforehand now it will be interesting to see a great female fighter going forward
MMA,not_removed,the ratings she brought in were insane and i dont think at least for a long time another woman will bring in the type of ratings she did
MMA,not_removed,rouseys mentality is definitely something to question
MMA,not_removed,what are you a virgin
MMA,not_removed,well they made a fuck ton of money because of it
MMA,not_removed,youre right they should strive to make less money
MMA,not_removed,lol this guy not realizing that without stars a fighting company flops i bet you thought was a good year for the ufc
MMA,not_removed,all the same things yall hate rousey for applies to most male mma stars especially connor wheres the hate there its brojob fest anytime anyone brings him up
MMA,not_removed,shes a huge star but that doesnt mean the ufc would have just canceled an entire division
MMA,not_removed,lol this guy not being able to read and interpret and coming to the stupidest conclusion possible theres a difference between stars and overhyped clowns like cm punk and ronda and several other loud mouth fan favorites pay attention kiddo
MMA,not_removed,all the same things yall hate rousey for applies to most male mma stars especially connor its brojob fest anytime anyone brings him up conor you must be new here conor is the most polarizing fighter on by far he gets shit ton of love and a shit ton of hate
MMA,not_removed,stars bring viewership lack of viewership leads to cancellation again as a casual fan if there wasnt a ronda i would have not bothered to tune in im sure there are alot of people like me casual viewership makes up the majority of something always hardcore fandom only stretches so far
MMA,not_removed,yep youre definitely a virgin
MMA,not_removed,ronda was a star and a draw you are a absolute idiot if you try to deny that in comparison jones was a better fighter but certainly a much lesser star also cm punk is a star in the ufc because he was a star in another industry not cause of his fighting skills its not hard to understand
MMA,not_removed,if that were the case then there would only be divisions in the ufc womens and whatever weight conor decides to fight in
MMA,not_removed,she was overhyped from the start and faced very lackluster competition on her way up its not a new trick theyve been doing it for years in combat sports hit the net i love the condescending tone in your replies its quite funny youre the guy who cant follow along and get the intended points and then you just reply all dickishly to whatever stupid opinion you thought i was trying to convey i dont care how well someone can work the mic or look good in photo ops or against lame opponents i care to see actual quality fighters duking it out id go watch boxing or wwe if i wanted charades and fireworks and faux drama what is so hard to understand and how am i or anyone who agrees with that sentiment crazy or the dickbag here
MMA,not_removed,lol what a pathetic loser you are a virgin miserably digging through my history to make yourself feel less of a fat virgin see thats what i could have said dont tell people you were looking through other peoples post history to find insults
MMA,not_removed,well you do understand that the vast majority disagree with you right theres a reason why a fight with bethe drew buys but all of aldos fights against much higher competition have less than except with conor i dont care what you like but the subject is about rondas importance to the sport
MMA,not_removed,you do realize the vast majority of people buy into the bullshit marketing i just described yeah its not like marketing is used as a tool to make ungodly amounts of money because it doesnt work on the average numbskull also read through my posts i worked behind the scenes of mma shows directly under the promoters for years im not talking out of my ass like you here bud
MMA,not_removed,such a clean shot never took his eyes off cruz
MMA,not_removed,hats off to cody i avoid listening to him talk but man its a pleasure to watch him fight
MMA,not_removed,could be the key to beating conors left hook
MMA,not_removed,conor is not dom
MMA,not_removed,its still a left hook lmao
MMA,not_removed,difference is conor can make you sleep with one of his
MMA,not_removed,so casual
MMA,not_removed,nice walk off casual as fuck
MMA,not_removed,lol then the first clip is of rose throwing ridiculous ax kicks and missing with a variety of other halfassed kicks yeah im sold taekwondo is cool
MMA,not_removed,no diakiese
MMA,not_removed,spinnin grinnin
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,oh man
MMA,not_removed,not to mention she got taken down on one of them
MMA,not_removed,thanks for linking that its one of the best ever but i think the video was made a while ago when i was around my taekwondo instructor said if we landed this technique and scored in a tournament he would take our family out for dinner haha
MMA,not_removed,incoming for sure onehundred percent cheeto fingers and other tired old comments im like a pink elephant among the grey ones i actually think he is talented and together with callen he is funny but i also see why he is so extremely disliked in this sub
MMA,not_removed,brendan looked like a glitch in the ea ufc game with his arms going up
MMA,not_removed,ill just leave this here httpsgfycatcompettyblaringgreatargus
MMA,not_removed,its tough man
MMA,not_removed,schaubs soul got launched further into space than the voyager probe there
MMA,not_removed,i bet against brendan that night i did not regret it for sure bet against schaub
MMA,not_removed,gadoosh
MMA,not_removed,i bet the invisible man was surprised
MMA,not_removed,dont go to the actual fighter and the kid subreddit its fucking insane hilarious though
MMA,not_removed,you complain about tired old comments and then use another one of his shaubisms yourself lose my number
MMA,not_removed,lose my number
MMA,not_removed,ooohh hey brandon
MMA,not_removed,thats a really stupid bet man that guy has an unreal work ethic
MMA,not_removed,who gives a shit
MMA,not_removed,is that vinny chase next to the golden snitch
MMA,not_removed,jeff novitsky jbj is worried
MMA,not_removed,paige
MMA,not_removed,who the fuck is john
MMA,not_removed,its jon no h
MMA,not_removed,pvz
MMA,not_removed,my mom
MMA,not_removed,this feels like one of those when you see it pics
MMA,not_removed,hes looking at pvzwaiting
MMA,not_removed,looking at the golden snitch like hope you dont catch me im a huge jones fan too
MMA,not_removed,damn thats so fucking random hahah
MMA,not_removed,yoooo aquaman
MMA,not_removed,ari is getting his people in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,you know it
MMA,not_removed,omo
MMA,not_removed,who was the croatian guy who jumped off a cliff to save people from a sinking car i think his name began with g
MMA,not_removed,good on him if hed of gotten injured in the process the reaction here would of been hilarious
MMA,not_removed,heroic thats the kind of mma story that should be in mainstream media
MMA,not_removed,httpstwittercomzidansports russian outlets reporting that ufc fighter rashid magomedov saved a drowning child yesterday dived into the channel amp dragged him out leave above link unaltered messagecomposetotweetpostersubjectsuggestion httpsgithubcomjoealcorntweetposter httpsgithubcomjoealcorntweetposterissues
MMA,not_removed,when an mma fighter which many times means some dude who fought times years a go in some small show commits a crime the media always covers the story and makes sure to mention he is an mma fighter hopefully they will make sure he is an mma fighter when they cover this story
MMA,not_removed,he could still be an asshole just a childsaving asshole but ill give him the benefit of the doubt
MMA,not_removed,i thought it was frowned up to save a child from a frozen lake in russia how are they supposed to grow strong if they are saved all the time
MMA,not_removed,good on him but to be honest its mostly a matter of being in that situation who would let a small child drown if you could hop into the pond and save it unless hes actively roaming around the neighbourhood looking for drowning kids to save
MMA,not_removed,thats what reza medadi did once on his way to stealing purses we need time for the whole story to develop jury still out on rashid afaik
MMA,not_removed,goran reljic the guy just had back surgery and went in to rescue someone who crashed through a rail and landed in a land unfortunately he never quite got back to form he had one amazing performance against wilson goveiau sp and then was plagued with injuries came back and just looked flat
MMA,not_removed,his last fight was last year and he still isnt scheduled to fight anyone
MMA,not_removed,whos drowning all these kids
MMA,not_removed,not everyone would and even if they did it doesnt take away from the fact that he saved a child from dying so props to him
MMA,not_removed,thats your response you sound like a nasty person in real life
MMA,not_removed,could yes would not so much
MMA,not_removed,most likely so whats your point
MMA,not_removed,thats what reza medadi did once on his way to stealing purses looter chris knows best
MMA,not_removed,this guy looked like he could have been something special too bad i loved the guy he was sort of like a minicro cop both in the way he fought the the whole croatian thing
MMA,not_removed,goran reljic and last seen losing a fight at rizins new years thing
MMA,not_removed,this dude barely ever fights otherwise he could be top ten by now with a normal schedule
MMA,not_removed,he was scheduled to fight chris wade in rotterdam but pulled out because of injury rustam khabilov stepped in and took care of business instead
MMA,not_removed,lets say you save a child from drowning the child runs back to the mother and shes in tears because shes so happy her child is back now how would you feel if she just ignored what you did or basically says to you anyone would have done it you arent special or would you want her to be thanking you which would make you feel better i can tell you the former would make me sad to see such little gratitude in a situation so terrifying
MMA,not_removed,not everyone is that brave they would rather call or really anyone and let them deal with it plus everyone is sue happy now you jump in and pull the kid out and he dies you get sued its life in america easier to let it be someone elses problem i personally would like to think i would help save a drowning person but there are factors i have two kids of my own do i risk my life to save someone elses i would like to believe i would but until youre in a situation its impossible to tell
MMA,not_removed,what a highlight i hadnt seen most of those early clips before his pride days but he was demolishing those people overeem has put together one of the best mma careers ever and he has done it with a surprising amount of submission wins i know his guillotine is fairly well known to be a strong weapon of his but arm bars kimuras americanasman he is a scary dude also who gets kod worse than todd duffey
MMA,not_removed,overeem is proof that you can lose your chin find it and then lose it all over again
MMA,not_removed,also who gets kod worse than todd duffey chuck liddell had his moments
MMA,not_removed,schaub
MMA,not_removed,haha thats a fair point us kiwis hoping hunt well and truly puts an end to his chin
MMA,not_removed,he never had a chin so im not sure where youre getting that from
MMA,not_removed,hes ours
MMA,not_removed,fair enough not a single quality australian born ufc fighter can understand why youd want to claim him
MMA,not_removed,hey big dan k will be in the ufc come sunday
MMA,not_removed,this is the variation ive seen of the same fucking meme
MMA,not_removed,troll
MMA,not_removed,cardiac arrest
MMA,not_removed,almost got me
MMA,not_removed,on behalf of the mma community go fuck yourself
MMA,not_removed,hopefully the mods ban this guy this is just stupid
MMA,not_removed,nooooooo edit fuck off
MMA,not_removed,fuck
MMA,not_removed,joke right
MMA,not_removed,hope you get banned
MMA,not_removed,enjoy your ban buddeh
MMA,not_removed,val is such a sweetheart
MMA,not_removed,nice way to cap off a fun main card
MMA,not_removed,i love these videos that extended exchange with buffer was a tad awkward though
MMA,not_removed,legit only behind the diaz bros as one of my favorite fighters in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,my neck hurts now
MMA,not_removed,shes like a female crocop and i like it
MMA,not_removed,why are they hugging again the fight is over
MMA,not_removed,does she bow every time someone speaks to her
MMA,not_removed,they almost hit heads
MMA,not_removed,it was almost a dwight schrute andy bernard moment
MMA,not_removed,i would hug valentina any time she wanted to hug
MMA,not_removed,bowing to your peers but especially your elders is very common practice in muay thai and asian martial arts in general i dont know if she has a thai coach or one of her coaches had a thai instructor but somewhere along the line it was deeply ingrained i grew up in karate and bowing became so second nature that i would do it at wrestling meets and soccer games in high school
MMA,not_removed,shes as pure as a mixed martial artist gets nothing but respect for this woman
MMA,not_removed,i get that i do too but not like times lol
MMA,not_removed,gadoosh
MMA,not_removed,have you almost broken the arm off a mother fucker in front of millions of people and earned yourself a shot at a world title and millions of dollars
MMA,not_removed,hes going light there
MMA,not_removed,cant wait for aldoholloway
MMA,not_removed,aldo needs to fight more than once a year
MMA,not_removed,rip holloways legs
MMA,not_removed,absolutely which makes it all the scarier
MMA,not_removed,why is this getting downvoted lol we all want to see aldo fight i dont get it
MMA,not_removed,he wanted to fight at but idk why he didnt fight after
MMA,not_removed,i dont think ufc are allowed to put lesnar on ufc
MMA,not_removed,im still waiting for the colored shorts to be put in the game
MMA,not_removed,minus will brooks and cock chestnar none really stick out for me to give a fuck
MMA,not_removed,who is perfect
MMA,not_removed,when they didnt update after ufc i figured its at end of support
MMA,not_removed,im sure the people who play that game are really bummed
MMA,not_removed,or the full shirts for the women
MMA,not_removed,krylov
MMA,not_removed,open weight goat mr perfect former wwe star
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,especially since he was in the first one
MMA,not_removed,the stephens inclusion here is hilarious
MMA,not_removed,the little spike when he retired in the spring lul
MMA,not_removed,if each fighter was a drug in a clinical trial stephens would be the placebo
MMA,not_removed,i never really understood how when dana said that rousey is still the biggest star the ufc has ever had especially with these last few conor cards but this definitely illustrates it
MMA,not_removed,i figured out why jeremy stephens
MMA,not_removed,til eddie alvarez isnt a mixed martial artist but just a search term
MMA,not_removed,the jeremy stephens line serves as a great baseline control group
MMA,not_removed,who the fuck is that guy
MMA,not_removed,including jeremy in this is savage
MMA,not_removed,what the fook is that purple line
MMA,not_removed,jeremy stephens who the fuuuk is da
MMA,not_removed,he is losing interest
MMA,not_removed,can strike with alvarez
MMA,not_removed,good luck getting upvotes on anything not dedicated to the career of jose aldo
MMA,not_removed,you can almost match it to when the quality of posts go down on this sub
MMA,not_removed,the last little aldo bump at the end was ufc thats what aldo can do when he is fighting on one of the biggest cards against frankie edgar this is how the ufc justifies aldo not getting a rematch right away
MMA,not_removed,this just in mcgregor is very popular
MMA,not_removed,conor bless
MMA,not_removed,i agree that mcgregor is a huge draw but this graph doesnt show it what youd need is to compare this to a graph of other main event fighters and their search frequency all this graph shows is that when fighters are about to fight they get searched a lot again im not disputing that mcgregor draws more searches than other fighters but it needs to be a relative comparison to be convincing
MMA,not_removed,practically illegible to a color blind person
MMA,not_removed,wow until you showed me that graph i was thinking jeremy stephens was way more popular thanks for the useful post s
MMA,not_removed,in case anybodys wondering the huge anderson spike is the leg break that went viral
MMA,not_removed,why is brock lesnar so popular in pakistan
MMA,not_removed,the brock lesnar search is so bizarre to me as he returned to the wwe in youd think itd spike there
MMA,not_removed,i still go watch old silva fights am i the only one
MMA,not_removed,why is there no significant lesnar peak for his win against the undertaker the internet got crazy when that happened even other terms like the undertaker and wreslemania look tiny next to the mma terms is the wwe in a bad shape
MMA,not_removed,gsp in there like old faithful
MMA,not_removed,who
MMA,not_removed,thanks for the cheese
MMA,not_removed,nah placebos are way more effective than that
MMA,not_removed,a lot of people have searched that guy til
MMA,not_removed,it actually matters in this case when google recognises conor mcgregor it includes all spellings and mcgregor ufc searches etc search term means just that and there is no other phrasings included
MMA,not_removed,just a quick question will you ever stop talking shit and try to contribute to a conversation i have seen you on here for the last couple of days just talking crap about aldo and mcgregor but never actually trying to contribute anything meaningful to a discussion why honestly i cant see any possible gain
MMA,not_removed,almost
MMA,not_removed,are you trying to say that jose doesnt deserve a rematch at this point its not right away and no shit he only got a little bump there were some great fighters on just not great fights
MMA,not_removed,it shouldnt be about who is a draw and what pulls the most numbers it should be about who is the best and the intrigue of finding out who is the best should pull numbers but the world has a fucking add boner for trash talk and celebrity news
MMA,not_removed,its funnier how you didnt realize that the last bump in the picture isnt the ufc press conference but diaz vs mcgregor ii
MMA,not_removed,interesting to see that ronda only hit those crazy high interest levels for the correia and holm fights i think the do nothing bitch clip going viral before the correia fight was a huge factor there
MMA,not_removed,ronda sold fighting bethe if holly hadnt slowed her momentum shed have continued to grow herself
MMA,not_removed,ronda is more pop culture she appeals to soccer moms who want to see another woman be badass but arent gonna actually sit down and watch the fight unless their boyfriendhusband buys it not being sexist just being real now compare it to mcgregor who appeals to the irish in general who are damn near exclusively known for drinking and fighting lol
MMA,not_removed,anecdotal evidence here but whenever i mention to people that i like mma the people who ask about it always ask is ronda coming back and the occasional when is brock fighting ive never been asked about conor from people who dont watch but on the other hand casual mma fans totally buy in to conor walk past any pub screening the fights for a conor ppv its absolute mania id say ronda is their biggest star people who dont know anything about mma know her name however conor is the biggest draw the casual mma fans open up their wallets to watch him it would be so interesting to know what would have happened had holm not kicked ronda in the head
MMA,not_removed,mcgregors hype and popularity is more closely tied to mma whereas rondas spills into pop culture film and girl power
MMA,not_removed,dana wasnt lying when he said she is their biggest star certain people scoffing and bringing up mcgregor because they cant look past ppv numbers
MMA,not_removed,i dont think she gets much less ppv sales than conor ufc outsold slightly even though was not as good a card did slightly less than after her victory over bethe ronda exploded in popularity to be probably one of the most talked about people and not just in mmasports circles but anywhere even though she lost her next fight and has not been back she still makes more headlines than anyone in her division
MMA,not_removed,my gf has recently gotten into watching mma with me shes from an irish family and kept hearing me talk about mcg so naturally she was curious i started to explained to her about how he is the biggest star in the sport atm and shes countered that rousey was she said i heard of rousey before i even knew what the ufc was i had never heard of conor mcgregor rousey is the much bigger star to which i countered that while rousey is well known in the mainstream that high profile notoriety is not translating into the insane recordbreaking ppv buys were seeing out of mcg and at the end of the day the number of buys is who determines the star
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,holy fucking shit rousey is mainstream if you type in floyds name the mayweatherpacquiao spike is only marginally larger than rouseyholm really interesting to see that rondas stardom translates into ppv sales much less than conors due to the demographics they appeal to ronda appeals to feminists but they dont wanna pay money to see her fights conor on the other hand gets more bang for his buck the quality of your fans matter
MMA,not_removed,ill never get those screams out of my head
MMA,not_removed,i just heard it in my head
MMA,not_removed,for some reason i was thinking it was when he front kicked vitor in the face
MMA,not_removed,that was the time i got into it too i remember i invited all of my friends to my place to watch the michael jordan of mma fight and he ended up getting knocked out while playing around i was a little embarrassed
MMA,not_removed,i noticed that he was the only person who didnt register correctly so i added another search where he did but i dont think it made a difference
MMA,not_removed,the big thing about lesnar is that a lot of his fans are pro wrestling cross overs and they buy ppvs
MMA,not_removed,aldos burger joint should change the name of a cheese burger to the mcgregor burger
MMA,not_removed,so kris mccray or bob sapp
MMA,not_removed,and they search it regularly peaking every couple of hours seems a little odd actually
MMA,not_removed,the worlds gone mad no s
MMA,not_removed,its a joke from the press conference he called out mcgregor and conor pretended to not know who he was
MMA,not_removed,look at your posts and tell me one fighter who can get better off of anything you have ever written ill wait
MMA,not_removed,the fact that you searched my history to find something to respond with says more about you than it does about me
MMA,not_removed,nah i would love to see the rematch its just that from the ufc perspective this is an obvious choice as to what fights to make aldo has had years to make a name and never did why not use conors spotlight to make more stars like nate
MMA,not_removed,i agree you can have both though too you get to see who is better alvarez or mcgregor and get shit talking its an interesting fight and you get the verbal drama leading up to it
MMA,not_removed,im gonna say that i truly think ms rouseys turn in fast and furious may have also been a factor i had never heard of mma saw her in that film and wanted to know more im ashamed of it but rondas role is absolutely the reason i got into mma and now i eat sleep and breathe this stuff i train i watch every fight i go to events i cant be the only one
MMA,not_removed,and there werent any other good fights on that card to support her that is on rondas shoulders alone
MMA,not_removed,conors fights are also at a much higher level of competitiondeeper division etc attracting fight fans in bigger numbers
MMA,not_removed,despite the fighting stereotype us irish are a pretty peaceful people i would say were some of the easiest going there is drinking on the other hand definitely accurate on that count
MMA,not_removed,you dont have to say not being sexist
MMA,not_removed,its not just the irish mcgregor appeals to
MMA,not_removed,while i think thats partially true i think its a bit of a limited scope as well i know plenty of women who have burst their ppv cherry with a ronda event often times complaining about how short the fight lasted on one hand were talking about appealing to the other of the population and on the other hand were talking about the effect that has on the way the ufc is viewed by those who had no previous interest in mma there are plenty of men especially in a millennial demographic that think anything related to the ufc is a bro thing meeting females that are interested in it changes that vibe quite a bit especially the feministsjw types that had flocked to rousey and stamped anything associated with her on social media as the ufc becomes less of a bro thing that opens up the market for females even more i realize this sub isnt a fan of sjwtypes but expansion isnt a bad thing for us as can be seen by the serving of events weve seen in the last years
MMA,not_removed,actually ill just simplify it i think the vast majority are men googling pictures of a popular new woman
MMA,not_removed,those stereotypes about the irish arent true in fact im gonna fight you for saying that takes sip of pint
MMA,not_removed,hahaha this is accurate as fuck
MMA,not_removed,also demographics matter brazilians tend to not pay for media so even though anderson was an enormous star he never had good ppv numbers gsp was never really mainstream but he had great ppv numbers
MMA,not_removed,depends how you define it google searches or cold hard cash which one is a more lucrative bizness
MMA,not_removed,yeah the only real difference is how she took the loss and how mcgregor took his if rousey came right back and fought holm she would be selling just as many ppvs
MMA,not_removed,interesting point actually when your most successful mainstream crossover isnt the biggest star for the actual fans like when beckham was playing football or indeed when rampage was in the a team
MMA,not_removed,spikes were before she got kod
MMA,not_removed,ronda appeals to women in general
MMA,not_removed,ronda was selling just as many ppvs she just didnt come back after her loss where as conor came right back
MMA,not_removed,youre assuming aldo would make a smart decision
MMA,not_removed,jared rosholt
MMA,not_removed,oh my god jeremy stephens is running a botnet that searches his name every few hours to try and keep himself relevant
MMA,not_removed,its basically just a when are the most people onlinechart showing the peaks in the evenings of the us with the valleys during the night and morning
MMA,not_removed,the guy you replied to pretty much said word for word what stephens responded with you goof
MMA,not_removed,because what im trying to do is help fighters no this is a place of discussion for human beings who are fans of mixed martial arts maybe to you know talk about interesting technique if we cant have reasonable discussion without calling a fighter a bum or an idiot i cant see the point of being here other than to circlejerk about your favorite fighter
MMA,not_removed,nah definitely says more about you
MMA,not_removed,alright i understand what youre getting at yeah i guess youre right about that but was aldo winning for a decade not making a name for himself dj is on a similar course just at a different point its unfortunate but you could argue that none of these guys are after fame and i think thats a lot more commendable than what conors doing aldo just wanted to avenge that sour first loss in a decade man breaks my heart that he probably wont get to
MMA,not_removed,its silly to be ashamed bro this is a safe space
MMA,not_removed,honestly who cares how you got into this great sport im just happy every time i learn someone else shares my passion
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor also has better fights against better competition
MMA,not_removed,us irish are a pretty peaceful people are we gonna act like the troubles never happened now
MMA,not_removed,doesnt hurt to say it though
MMA,not_removed,the sjw types are going to turn it around on us though men like watching women beat each other up because thats what they want to do to women type things
MMA,not_removed,you clearly dont live in canada sir
MMA,not_removed,yup ronda may have gotten a lot more mainstream media coverage than connor but that didnt necessarily translate into more ppv buys i think connor has also peaked the interest of a lot of boxing fans as well it also doesnt hurt that mayweather doesnt just dismiss connor but acknowledges him and actually entertained the idea of fighting him in a boxing match
MMA,not_removed,well theres more to it than just google searches theres increased brand and sport awareness removing stigma which is still an issue broad changing of the usual narrative which has lead to big exposure and popularity wave within the msm and demographics all of that and more is very substantial ronda has done a lot its not all about ppv is all i think its certainly understandable that dana calling her their biggest star is accurate and appropriate
MMA,not_removed,had they scheduled a rematch around the time the original was supposed to happen shed have the ppv record and it could have probably got near mil but shes weak mentally
MMA,not_removed,who
MMA,not_removed,oops im a goof i will take the downvotes on the chin
MMA,not_removed,i never called any fighter in division a bum or an idiot stop making shit up because i triggered you
MMA,not_removed,how dare you imply that jose aldo and nate diaz are better than bethe correia and alexis davis
MMA,not_removed,try tell half of them theyre irish
MMA,not_removed,so is every non white french person in france a terrorist
MMA,not_removed,the troubles were mainly limited to northern ireland which is part of britain
MMA,not_removed,it youre saying something true fuck it
MMA,not_removed,i see where youre coming from its just how afraid we are at offending people that we have to say stuff like that
MMA,not_removed,it kind of does for example when someone says not being racist but you expect some racist shit to follow
MMA,not_removed,wait thats why you watch it i only watch it because its like mudwrestling but instead of mud covering the boobs its reebok
MMA,not_removed,hah no i dont but i think thats very telling that there are far fewer canadians then brazilians but mainstream canadians generate way more money i probably should have been clearer on that
MMA,not_removed,good points have an up vote and youre on steroids
MMA,not_removed,jeremy that guy
MMA,not_removed,i wasnt accusing you of that the pejorative we in this case was used as a general term for the users of the rmma subreddit that was more a plea of general sportmanship than an accusation of your character and all im asking is why bother digging at aldo here the concern of the masses for aldos career makes sense for many of us here he was the reason we originally got excited about lower weight divisions and to see him quiting because of his perceived mistreatment at the hands of the ufc has us all a little nostalgic so we wanna talk about it seems reasonable enough doesnt it at least as reasonable as the excitement for mcgregor vs alvarez
MMA,not_removed,seems awkward but ill try
MMA,not_removed,as a canadian i have to stand up for alexis its everyone else that sucks
MMA,not_removed,i didnt pretend that french people are pretty peaceful
MMA,not_removed,a scary high number of them sympathize with them at least
MMA,not_removed,whys he gotta be white cant a knight be a brotha trigger warning safe zone
MMA,not_removed,very true i concede defeat here
MMA,not_removed,good point looks like were agreeing with something but looking at it in different angles the fact people get quite easily offended is stupid but as you said people shouldnt give too much of a shit about it disclaimers do or hopefully i would think help what would have been an offended person give the guy and his argument a chance though so its more than just if at all because of fear of coming off offensive
MMA,not_removed,thats if you arent really giving the guy a chance i do agree sometimes it is used as a falsedisclaimer just to say racistsexist things but that isnt always the case i generally keep an open mind so if someone puts that disclaimer i anticipate something controversial at face value but if i break it down it isnt really controversial at all prejudging happens way too much in society these days
MMA,not_removed,i watch it because sometimes its fun to be reminded how nontechnical most of the male fighters use to be
MMA,not_removed,one of the most brand loyal nationalities in the world we like everyone but we fucking love being us and we love when one of our own is the best at something put a maple leaf on anything you can sell it
MMA,not_removed,oh good one
MMA,not_removed,i feel like a lot of older ppl are sad their era is gone and aldo was a representation of that era but yo he gone mcgregors era in full effect we looked back at his entire career day inday out leading up to then we did it again for and we all know what happen then lastly ufc he fought to not lose against an old frankie edgar so then we reflected on how he used to be once again at what point are we just going to accept this is a new era with a new champ who has the potential to be just as dominate with an incredible fighting style but also with the drawing power we all wish aldo had sure soak in nostalgia but dont deny thats what you guys have been doing for over a year
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,the ufc needs a dana black for balance
MMA,not_removed,because black knights are usually short on hands and not good at defending
MMA,not_removed,i think youll find fighting to not lose is the smart way to fight that shows evolution and it showed a willingness to learn from past mistakes i believe that if aldo was to keep fighting he could easily regain his former glory its not like the dude is really old plus how would we know if conor has the ability to be a dominant champ or not he wont defend his belt
MMA,not_removed,who never lies for balance
MMA,not_removed,im annoyed that hadnt even crossed my mind have an up vote and the cunts down voting mesuck a bag of dicks
MMA,not_removed,tis but a scratch
MMA,not_removed,im not taking anything away from him for doing so we knew the situation at hand what i am saying is that wasnt the aldo you fell in love with from the wec days yes we dont know how well conor can defend but i dont see anything at testing him anytime soon do you i also feel like has some favorable styles for him depending on how well he does vs eddie he already has the same exact amount of fights in the ufc as aldo his era has just started in most eyes
MMA,not_removed,i can see holloway giving him some real problems holloway has possibly the most growth of any fighter in the time period since his first loss to mcgregor im also not convinced the aldo rematch goes in his favor the second time round and even if you think it does of the time you still have to prove it
MMA,not_removed,i mean edgar could probably easily win over mcgregor if not finish him
MMA,not_removed,im a big fan of holloway vs aldo but i see a healthy conor still dominating him for max has gotten worlds better but in that same time so has conor i still think skill gape will be just as wide but both fighters will be better max vs aldo or max vs conor are both fights id pay to see i dont think any fighter shorter then conor will be beating him anytime soon he just eats those guys up
MMA,not_removed,its certainly well withing conors ability to dominate max but id still like to see him be able to do it in the ring this whole thing just feels a little rushed to me but it is going to be fun i cant deny that
MMA,not_removed,who da fook is that guy
MMA,not_removed,so we sre just posting a selfies now
MMA,not_removed,who the fuck is that guy
MMA,not_removed,this would be more interesting if you were actually doing some form of training
MMA,not_removed,awesome pics great size look thick solid tight keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips show us what you got man wanna see how freakin huge solid thick and tight you can get thanks for the motivation
MMA,not_removed,what organization
MMA,not_removed,forgot to inject your legs brah
MMA,not_removed,rmma is always ready to back an up and coming fighter but you got to give us something to work with name organization opponent weight class
MMA,not_removed,benavidez cutting to plastic weight
MMA,not_removed,i mean he is in a gym
MMA,not_removed,new walkout song love or hate mcgregor its hard to deny hes making cultural impact beyond mma
MMA,not_removed,i dont get it pound guy looks big next to smaller guy
MMA,not_removed,baby snake in the room
MMA,not_removed,this just in a former lhw looks way bigger than a bantamweight
MMA,not_removed,thats why i come here for shitposts like this
MMA,not_removed,yoel now has to wait for themoney fight between tj and dillashaw ufc daddies mad
MMA,not_removed,wack post
MMA,not_removed,bisping is easily
MMA,not_removed,i think hes gonna go for belts middleweight down to lightweight what better way to cement his legacy as the goat and is there a bigger fight than mcgregor vs gsp if gsp was the current welterweight and middleweight champ
MMA,not_removed,as far as im concern gsp doesnt want to fight in the summer so bisping is probably going to fight yoel
MMA,not_removed,its really well done httpswwwinstagramcompbrjbcyacxx
MMA,not_removed,i would be much more impressed if he defended the middleweight belt against yoeljacare this honestly strikes me as a tougher lineup than woodleylightweight champion
MMA,not_removed,bisping is the goat of bullshitting
MMA,not_removed,lol bisping has had chances to fight yoel he wants none of that crazy cuban
MMA,not_removed,almost looks like a painting its amazing
MMA,not_removed,especially compared to garbrant ð
MMA,not_removed,i cant picture gsp risking the chance of being brutally kod by yoel a fight against yoel would without a doubt be the toughest fight for him in his career hell most likely fight silva and then woodley or maia
MMA,not_removed,im not one to call late stoppage often but that was late
MMA,not_removed,i didnt know there was a ring like that in middle earth that scenery is fucking epic where is this taking place
MMA,not_removed,cool concept but way too underdeveloped to be responsibly conducted in a way that prevents unnecessary damage maybe a censor system like fencing could be adapted
MMA,not_removed,ref as far away as possible from the action lets just watch someone die
MMA,not_removed,take one guess homie
MMA,not_removed,that has to be some russian shit
MMA,not_removed,mike silverberg started this petition with a single signature the arch nemesis of goldberg
MMA,not_removed,i read that if it reaches signatures they discuss it in the white house
MMA,not_removed,supporters
MMA,not_removed,i dont know how this fair this fight is but i always have questions like this how would a top middleweight who is big for his size do against a heavyweight how would jon jones do against a submission specialist who is and stuff like that man what kind of offense can mighty mouse put up against stefan struve manhoef vs godz ok
MMA,not_removed,youre doing gods work my man
MMA,not_removed,mods keep this
MMA,not_removed,lol well played dave
MMA,not_removed,we have these petitions in the uk as well and it gets talked about in parliament the only thing with these is people dont realise they are watering down an effective way to get their voice heard we struggle as a collective to have our points listened to by our governments with the age of the internet we get this new avenue where people can raise a point and if enough people agree action may happen unfortunately its changed from having a real impact to small joke like petitions about everything and anything we finally get a way to give us a voice and we piss it all away
MMA,not_removed,the new white house cut that shit real quick
MMA,not_removed,someone started a changeorg petition when nick diaz got a ticket year suspension for weed it came back after it got the signatures needed and said it needs to be taken up with the state athletic commission expect something similar here
MMA,not_removed,god is busy giving aids to babies this week
MMA,not_removed,wtf this is important stuff
MMA,not_removed,you mean like global warming
MMA,not_removed,no like a petition to force the ufc to make rockhold be werdum happen
MMA,not_removed,my gut is telling me gay jesus
MMA,not_removed,i joined the team long ago
MMA,not_removed,im rooting for the chris but i have a bad feeling that romero is going to maul him
MMA,not_removed,im thinking weidman can endure whatever yoel throws at him for the first round or two then its all chris
MMA,not_removed,war romero
MMA,not_removed,weidman i think he has the bigger edge in most areas
MMA,not_removed,ynuevo
MMA,not_removed,honestly idk romero was a beast but he may have been on something im excited to see how he does on his fight back on the other hand weidman took a nasty beating that could have potentially changed him forever also is weidman past his physical prime at this point he looks a lot smaller since cutting out beer and hes had so many injuriessurgeries
MMA,not_removed,romero tko
MMA,not_removed,rounder would benefit the chris having said that yoel is insanely dangerous in a rounder and idk if the chris has the athleticism to get yoel he could do it but i think this is a bad matchup for weidman
MMA,not_removed,the chris with a hook
MMA,not_removed,depends which weidman shows up romero can blitz and finish anyone in the world but if weidman is significantly hindered by the layoffinjuryloss against rockhold id definitely favor romero the fact that its a rounder also is a big advantage for romero its tough as fuck to predict i think im gonna go with romero though probably by decision go cuba
MMA,not_removed,weidman via head kick round
MMA,not_removed,weidman the man is an animal make no mistake smarter fighter than most people give him credit too i think he takes a wide yet fairly unentertaining decisions
MMA,not_removed,weidman and his messed up neck have me thinking that romero has this in the bag weidmans chin is legit though
MMA,not_removed,the chris over no forgay jesus
MMA,not_removed,three round fight makes this one really hard to predict i suspect romero will be explosive as fuck for the first round or two i also think weidman will probably be able to survive that initial onslaught and take over during the second half of the fight yoel will inevitably gas out but at that point it may be too late and romero could win on points
MMA,not_removed,ynuevo lol hes always posting that in my opinion romero needs to knock him out in the first two rounds
MMA,not_removed,yoel wins the first two rounds and wins the fight
MMA,not_removed,this sub is pretty anti the chris since his last fight but im not jointheteam yallmustveforgot
MMA,not_removed,i think romero will do better pressuring and taking the chris down but i feel the chris will be better on the ground the chris striking is better if he doesnt throw any wheel kicks and i see him exploiting romeros tendency to throw everything and gas within the first or second round the fact its only a rounder definitely benefits romero though if it was a rounder it would be no question for the chris in my mind
MMA,not_removed,gay superhero jesus
MMA,not_removed,i hope romero wins
MMA,not_removed,the man on the slippery mat
MMA,not_removed,soldier of gay jesus
MMA,not_removed,i mean its hard to give the advantage to weidman in any field striking i would say neither is spectacular but yoel seems to have more power as far as wrestling goes weidman is great but yoel is a two time olympic medalist the guy is a rock maybe the cardio field but even there we have seen weidman slowing down in a couple of his fights too
MMA,not_removed,weidman tko just a guess i agree this fight is the hardest to predict romero is an absolute beast obviously the chris is too but that rockhold loss may have taken a toll on him
MMA,not_removed,weidman by decision but romero ko is always a possibility
MMA,not_removed,weidman either by decision or submission
MMA,not_removed,gonna go with romero that guy has serious power weidman is a great fighter and well rounded so i wouldnt be surprised either way im picking romero via ko though
MMA,not_removed,if chris wont get caught in first or rounds im picking him but its very tricky to not get tooled by fresh romero but basically every third round in last couple fights he was barely able to fight if jacare was not stupid or overconfident he would tko romero for shure if not the stool gate even kennedy had chance to finish him at the beggining of last round he was fading against machida but not getting caught for whole minutes wont be easy maybe if he will utilise offensive wreastling heavy tactics and put romero on his back couple times and tire him there hell get the nod edited the sickness thx hifiveghost
MMA,not_removed,yoel romero no forget romero people
MMA,not_removed,really wish this was a rounder kinda makes me wish this one fight wasnt on so it could headline its own card but who am i kidding is gonna be amazing
MMA,not_removed,join the team
MMA,not_removed,im thinking itll be a draw yoel will win the first and second round but lose a point for fence grabbing in one of them while chris wins the third round or at least thats what i want to happen two of my favorite fighters are fighting and i just cant pick between them
MMA,not_removed,you never know but im feeling second round tko for weidman im feeling he ends up outwrestling yoel and tkos him from mount
MMA,not_removed,romero hes the better wrestler and i think he has more power than weidman
MMA,not_removed,the chris if he fights smart and manages his distance and timing if the chris fights wild gay jesus can hurt him
MMA,not_removed,weidman by tko in the third after barely weathering a scary storm in the first
MMA,not_removed,weidman just seems better overall but i need to watch more of both fighters to make a better prediction
MMA,not_removed,gay jesus via cubansplosiveness
MMA,not_removed,people no for gay the chris talent im hoping he shines and makes a comeback
MMA,not_removed,i like romero more but id bet that weidman outlasts him in a decision romero controlling the first and weidman coming back
MMA,not_removed,weidman by cardio
MMA,not_removed,i had yoel when he faced jacare i like weidman but i see yoel surprising people again hes a straight up demon in the early rounds
MMA,not_removed,yoel by rounds of extra stool rest to tko
MMA,not_removed,didnt see much mention of the home field advantage that weidman will have i think that will make the difference in the early going when romero is at his most dangerous weidman will weather the early attack and finish the fight after that i feel it will be a barn burner
MMA,not_removed,hopefully it ends in a double fatality
MMA,not_removed,weidman with a bullet too savvy too young too much gas in the tank for ol yoel
MMA,not_removed,this is going to be a great rounder and vs jacare yoel was gassed
MMA,not_removed,weidman is gonna body that fool
MMA,not_removed,chris is still my boy
MMA,not_removed,weidman stop doubting him
MMA,not_removed,if it gets past the i would pick weidman
MMA,not_removed,weidman just to see the rockhold fight rematch and fight bisping
MMA,not_removed,weidman if he can holdout the hurricane for the first round and
MMA,not_removed,this is a free fight for weidman dont be silly
MMA,not_removed,honestly i think weidman has peaked and the aftermath of injuries are starting to stack on him now romero is a beast and dude has been rested for a while now
MMA,not_removed,romero fans are downvoting all the comments that are choosing weidman as of this post smh
MMA,not_removed,whoever doesnt soil themselves first
MMA,not_removed,roids win
MMA,not_removed,romero with ease
MMA,not_removed,you sure its your gut and not your penis
MMA,not_removed,i go for gay jesus too his wrestling is in a totally different league than weidmans on the floor he put some heavy damage on jacare without getting caught so im sure he could do the same if not worse to weidman striking is probably pretty comparable romero has more advantages in core areas so im going with him
MMA,not_removed,hes still my boy
MMA,not_removed,i just want weidman to showcase that grappling that made him a bjj star and nullified damien maia agin in this fight he will have to bring that and the distance management acumen that nullified lyoto machidas game as well
MMA,not_removed,yoel has one round to destroy him maybe one and a half then weidman gets to have his way i see him getting sluggish and tired should be some banging shots in the opening round though
MMA,not_removed,romero pretty much stopped fighting after one hard round against jacare chris is a champion he can rally and overtake this fight late
MMA,not_removed,and new what this isnt a title fight lol unless you mean the title for jesus chosen at weidman is currently defending after taking that title from belfort
MMA,not_removed,goddamn right
MMA,not_removed,it certainly is a bad match up if yoel gets tired though hes fucked weidman just needs to survive that long
MMA,not_removed,spinning or no
MMA,not_removed,good guess id side with you on it i think the first round will be alot of pressure from yoel shoots gnp if he has the chance but i think weidman round tko
MMA,not_removed,romero has a messed up neck too though he cant move his head side to side
MMA,not_removed,interestingly enough the last yoel romero finishes ended in the round
MMA,not_removed,oh thats a good point so used to seeing chris in fiverounders i didnt even consider that
MMA,not_removed,maybe romero isnt the same without his tainted supplements
MMA,not_removed,ben henderson is in bellator now
MMA,not_removed,weidman has the striking advantage brunson took yoel down so weidman can and the chris has a big advantage on the ground and he has better cardio only advantage yoel has is athleticism imo
MMA,not_removed,caught
MMA,not_removed,i think weidman has peaked and the aftermath of injuries are starting to stack on him now what are you basing this off of
MMA,not_removed,if derek brunson can take yoel down weidman can
MMA,not_removed,lol yoels wrestling is not in a whole nother league weidman might actually be better than him but id call it at even medals dont necessarily mean youre better than someone that doesnt have medals
MMA,not_removed,chris and rockhold rolled to a stalemate where neither could advance that shit was a mazing
MMA,not_removed,yoel says this on all of his social media posts and this is possibly a title eliminator
MMA,not_removed,the chris could always get it done but the soldier of god has gay jesus on his side so who knows ð
MMA,not_removed,since weidman has been adding cinnamon and milk to his oatmeal those spinning kicks will land weidman within
MMA,not_removed,damn then i dont know who will have their hands raised
MMA,not_removed,wait is this really true
MMA,not_removed,i think of his fight against souza and do not see a guy who could go three hard rounds i will have to go back and watch these fights of course but i dont recall any of these guys having much for romero besides kennedy but then we had the whole stool thing that is an interesting point to keep in mind though
MMA,not_removed,its pretty obvious thats what hes saying
MMA,not_removed,thx
MMA,not_removed,really yoels wrestling hasnt transferred to mma with the same level of brilliance you might expect from an olympic silver medalist brunson didnt just take him down he outwrestled him that fight straight up defended all takedowns landed his own and enjoyed significantly more control time romero is such an x factor that you never want to bet against him but to say his mma wrestling is stellar is just wrong tough out for weidman but hes still my boy
MMA,not_removed,derek bruson also made yoel shit himself i still cant belive people were writing him off in that uriah hall fight
MMA,not_removed,cannot wait for a rematch of that to be perfectly honest hoping the chris gets past yoel maybe just so we can have that rematch sooner although im a softy for the chris anyways
MMA,not_removed,he has some reputation as a prodigy of bjj for surviving against andre galvao as a purple belt
MMA,not_removed,y nuevo and new in spanish
MMA,not_removed,man theyre fucked if it goes to the decision they wont know if their opponents hand is raised or not
MMA,not_removed,yup he got a few disks surgically fused and almost had to retire because of it
MMA,not_removed,but theres been nothing to suggest that this is the first ive ever heard anyone mention it he loses once to rockhold a hungry and well rounded fighter and suddenly hes a ped user
MMA,not_removed,i think you guys are right and i was wrong with my assertion that romeros wrestling is in a different league than weidmans its sort of a roger gracie situation in pure bjj gracie is obviously better than maia but in an mma context maia has had better success with bjj i think part of it is romero gets fatigued and then his wrestling is a lot less effective jacare only got him down once he was tired but thats obviously part of the game and he could very well have to wrestle with weidman once hes fatigued
MMA,not_removed,agreed derek may just be the next champion
MMA,not_removed,no it was the fact that once usada came around he lost like lbs of muscle and came into fight week weighing closer to what a ww should be weighing when asked about it he said he stopped drinking beer you must not have been here during then because we were definitely talking about it
MMA,not_removed,hey man thing is we could be totally wrong maybe yoel shows up fight night and ragdolls the chris i remember being very surprised at how small weidman looked last fight i will be genuinely sad if we dont see things play out a little on the ground i love match ups like this
MMA,not_removed,not a star necessarily but this was pretty early on in his training and again at purple belt against andre galvao he seemed to be pretty untouchable for a while and people got hype
MMA,not_removed,surviving means not tapping and properly defending himself
MMA,not_removed,if only rose was as good at blocking knees as fox is at blocking videos from my country
MMA,not_removed,even i started to feel those knees by the end of the fight
MMA,not_removed,holy fuck those knees o
MMA,not_removed,usmexygorilla ushalankers proxy if blocked in your country like mine
MMA,not_removed,blocked in my country
MMA,not_removed,fuckkkk youuuu foxwhy is it blocked
MMA,not_removed,so wins in a row is giving you the second largest streak in the strawweight division yikes
MMA,not_removed,jedrzejczykt
MMA,not_removed,thank you so much
MMA,not_removed,proxy if blocked in your country like mine
MMA,not_removed,telling someone head movement is not coaching theyve been together for years and ronda is still stiff as a board
MMA,not_removed,edmond is a shitty fucking coach but he wasnt wrong in his cornering advice that said edmond is a delusional slimy dumpstertier coach no more excuses for her and their team
MMA,not_removed,nice try edmond
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,a good coach works skills like that into you so they come out without you even having to think about them
MMA,not_removed,not sure if serious
MMA,not_removed,deleted in
MMA,not_removed,listen edmond if you could train someone properly youd have some success out of your camp every fighter you train fails
MMA,not_removed,cmon guys edmond is a master at evading taxes that is
MMA,not_removed,id give him the benefit of the doubt if he had any real mma clients besides the two weirdos who have looked like garbage the last two years
MMA,not_removed,edmond has on nunez hence the awful coaching
MMA,not_removed,it is stupid we should be praising nunes for performance not blaming someone for rhondas loss nunes is a monster and an example of how much wmma has progressed better coaching wasnt going to help rhonda
MMA,not_removed,beautiful champ
MMA,not_removed,this
MMA,not_removed,leaning forward constantly too
MMA,not_removed,but thats on ronda edmund is a boxing coach not a fucking miracle worker everyone doesnt become a great or even good stand up fighter with even many years of experience there are journeymen fighters that have been training for years with good coaches and never amount to much in the pro ranks some people just dont make itlet alone someone whose only been boxing for a few years
MMA,not_removed,champ
MMA,not_removed,then he should teach her how to move her fucking head if thats his damn specialty and if she cant get good at it then you draft a game plan that has her utilizing her strengths like her world class judo
MMA,not_removed,how is it on ronda if a guy who is purportedly mostly a boxing coach cant get a fighter to learn how to take their head off the center line after a half decade unless ronda has some physical defect that doesnt allow her spine and neck to move that way edmond should probably take the lions share of the blame
MMA,not_removed,beautiful
MMA,not_removed,cant use world class judo if you cant get inside without getting smashed hard and clean are you guys just being deliberately obtuse or what why arent you getting this judo isnt wresting judo isnt striking for judo to work you need the cinch
MMA,not_removed,he looks two inches taller than her wtf are you watching
MMA,not_removed,i feel like almost every fighter adds an inch or two conor used to be while hes actually and eddie says hes while hes clearly shorter than conor its kinda funny
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt look shorter than ronda to me but yeah bj has always been listed as and it makes sense to me
MMA,not_removed,hes not small its just the angle
MMA,not_removed,its weird how often they billed some of the fighters with incorrect heights for years they constantly switched gsps height from to and vice versa
MMA,not_removed,yeah i was wrong i guess i expected more size disparity between them and ronda did not look too outsized visually
MMA,not_removed,conor was listed as only once seemingly randomly for his brandao fight
MMA,not_removed,yeah i was wrong i guess i expected more size disparity between them and ronda did not look too outsized visually
MMA,not_removed,and gsp is huge
MMA,not_removed,cant outsize bj the boy has a piece on him
MMA,not_removed,i just wanted to see if the stencil of the dick on his friends back worked lol
MMA,not_removed,good news for bisping this kid is for on his embedded predictions so far it should be the new curse if bisping actually wins
MMA,not_removed,seems like a running joke with the kid he always bets against bisping
MMA,not_removed,kid said anderson was gonna win their fight too dont believe his lies bispings kid its my lock of the week
MMA,not_removed,you should of called seat check looks like you got jacked by your pup lol ð
MMA,not_removed,english mastiff i had a french mastiff
MMA,not_removed,so rmma is just pics of peoples couches and tvs now why not use the first thread the guy created
MMA,not_removed,yeahes about a year and a half now
MMA,not_removed,i enjoy it
MMA,not_removed,just having a little fun sorry if this pissed you off
MMA,not_removed,i thought he was a puppy mastiffs are the best
MMA,not_removed,hes a douche often dont bother
MMA,not_removed,yea he didnt get as big as we hoped he would his mom was pretty small
MMA,not_removed,well so much for that they just removed my post
MMA,not_removed,its better for his health the bigger he is the more likely he will have joint issues and hip dysplasia edit also he will fill out
MMA,not_removed,i had a female mastiff before him her hips gave out when she was hardest thing ive gone through
MMA,not_removed,my frenchie had heart failure at it runs in the breed im not big on pure breads but no one bought him for awhile so we kind of rescued him
MMA,not_removed,yea i think he will be our last mastiff the wife and i have been talking about rescue dogs i have come to the opinion that pure breeds are basically animal cruelty
MMA,not_removed,its tough mastiffs are the best dogs but interbreeding is so dangerous for the animals
MMA,not_removed,that is one of the best adverts i have ever seen
MMA,not_removed,and lost
MMA,not_removed,like anothony perosh
MMA,not_removed,this card is crazy stacked for a wsof event should be fun
MMA,not_removed,meh
MMA,not_removed,always liked vinny but outside of grappling he doesnt have much to brag about that flying armbar on weidman and the rubber shoulderarm against werdum are some of my favorite adcc moments though
MMA,not_removed,lol exactly who has magalhaes beaten nobody on branchs level
MMA,not_removed,that fight pissed me off
MMA,not_removed,renato laranja bjj world champion for one
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck hes just standing around waiting get over yourselves
MMA,not_removed,i think from danas side theyd rather have tyron good personality well spoken likable articulate and he can knock people out they can send him out to promote with a higher chance of conversion not that robbie isnt likeable hes just serial killer likeable
MMA,not_removed,thats the same face he made when holly beat ronda
MMA,not_removed,i hate when people freeze frames and read into it peoples expressions can change from one second to the best youre just finding one that fits your narrative
MMA,not_removed,well its not like i enjoy having woodley as champion either when hes talking about not defending the title against the rightful number one contenders
MMA,not_removed,its all about laayeeeers
MMA,not_removed,this just makes me sad for ufc even more i need to see jones dc jones beat osp and convincingly despite not looking as dominant as his former self dc had beat rumble and gus and was looking very good they hate eachother with a passion and that just makes fights far more interesting for me i fucking loive a good grudge match if dc jones never happens it might actually be my number best fight that never happened in mma
MMA,not_removed,that must have been such a confidence boost for jon a very strong performance against a great shows why hes considered a goat candidate just off his prehit and run career
MMA,not_removed,i remember cormier saying jon couldnt take him down and then seconds into the fight jon took him down
MMA,not_removed,who do yall have winning between dc and rumble i think rumble can catch him in the first round
MMA,not_removed,goat
MMA,not_removed,just so ruthless how he jumps on him no concern whatsoever dcs knee looked weird there
MMA,not_removed,dc is one of the greatest lhwhws of all time but i just feel like his expiration date is coming up hes been tagged hard in his past missed outta his past scheduled fights with injuries and for fight he made at by his own admission he struggled with his camp and weight cut and looked relatively uninspiring million justifiable reasons for this as well hes been out nearly a year and father time is undefeated outside tom brady
MMA,not_removed,yeah man im rooting for rumble but a small part of me wants dc to win just so we can have a better chance at seeing jones vs dc
MMA,not_removed,yeah i think its pretty risky to be that confident though his coach said that hes been focusing alot on powerlifting instead of actually trying to improve himself more i think it comes back to bite him in the ass
MMA,not_removed,jbj has done this in a few fights he basically strikes with the people that say they are strikers takes down the people that say they are wrestlers is willing to hunt submissions against submission artists etc its a crazy ego thing with him but since it has historically worked im not going to complain
MMA,not_removed,i think dc is a safer choice he is a competitor in the truest sense of the word and i believe hell outwork johnson again that being said there is a very real possibility of johnson knocking his block off in the first or second round
MMA,not_removed,i agree with you the adjustments rumble has to make are much much easier to implement than what dc needs to implemnet in a rematch
MMA,not_removed,im sure toms got a little help from some doctors to try to defeat father time
MMA,not_removed,diont forget randy couture
MMA,not_removed,even tim duncan couldnt escape time forever
MMA,not_removed,jaromir jagr
MMA,not_removed,i think rumble takes him out this time but dc jones would be fantastic id imagine if dc wins both hed retire on top
MMA,not_removed,not if your name is jon jones i dont think you know exactly how confident he was this guy was rolling out of bed after drinking all night and smashing people i dont think hes gotten much more confident since hes been out of the game i wouldnt be too worried about jon jones
MMA,not_removed,he looked subpar at ufc i truly believe if that jon jones was up against dc he would have lost
MMA,not_removed,i think rumble has around a minute window if he doesnt land hes done
MMA,not_removed,dc is the safe bet but im getting a feeling that rumble might get it done this time
MMA,not_removed,that and a deal with satan
MMA,not_removed,id love to see rumble win even though im a bigger dc fan id really love to see either man starch jones just dont see how
MMA,not_removed,yeahjones wouldnt have it had nothing to do with looking subpar or powerlifting or usada jones lackluster performance against osp had everything to do with style basically cormier cant fight jones at any other distance other than the clinch its impossible for him and i dont know if theres a clinch battle in mma that jones cant win the funny thing is due to jones reach a lot of people think you have to fight jones inside to beat him in reality his clinchinside game is where hes the most dangerous you have to fight jones from the outside to beat him and the hype about jones outwrestling an olympian is overblown its not so much that jones outwrestled an olympian rather jones overpowered one of the best clinch fighters in mma cormier and then took him down just to prove a point jones size leverage cardio and takedown defense in the clinch just makes him a terrible matchup for cormier against osp jones couldnt be as dominant a clinch force since osp didnt need to fight jones from the clinch osp is a bigger longer guy plus jones still isnt a good transitional fighter from phase to phase on the feet so he couldnt force the clinch against osp without getting tagged on the way in so it lead to jones just kind of potshotting osp from a distance with kicks until osp was so tired that jones could just walk into the clinch with him and then dominate late round
MMA,not_removed,i truly believe the jones who beat osp beats the dc who beat anderson
MMA,not_removed,its not so much that he has a time based window since rumble can probably stand up and fight for at least rounds if cormier can make rumble carry his weight for minutes rumble will be just about done cormier wont be able to sit back and wait for the window to close he will have to close it himself
MMA,not_removed,i can definitely see how rumble would do it
MMA,not_removed,thats a great assessment it makes sense that gus was the only other guy to hurt jones he is also long and fought from range i think jones can be beaten by a long skilled kickboxer that will out strike jones at a distance the problem is jones will takedown a long kickboxer that is outscoring him in stand up
MMA,not_removed,great points but youd still expect one of the goats to easily dispatch of a guy like osp tbh
MMA,not_removed,jones isnt really a great finisher anymore which is fine but it is what it is
MMA,not_removed,i wonder who has more cte sakuraba or fujita both have sustained horrendous beatings japanese matchmakers are so horrible to their big names
MMA,not_removed,seanbaby
MMA,not_removed,sagat type of shit
MMA,not_removed,and the uberknee was born
MMA,not_removed,high knee
MMA,not_removed,horsemeat is a helluva drug
MMA,not_removed,gotta be terrifying to have to guess if its a body kick or a knee to the forehead that height difference is a killer
MMA,not_removed,always makes me sad when i see previously unkoable guys start to get kod until i realize that it was probably an accumulation of all the big hits they used to walk through taking their toll then i get even more sad cause it means they probably have all the cte
MMA,not_removed,wasnt fujita in a minicoma after that fight i seem to recall he was unconscious for a loooooong time
MMA,not_removed,sakuraba probably has cte fujita just has grey pink mush where his brain used to be
MMA,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikigarygoodridgekickboxingrecord he was a mediocre mma fighter and threw him in with bernardo jlb hunt aerts mighty mo sefo feitosa remy fucking hong man choi many of those names he fought multiple times and ended with a record stopped by kotko
MMA,not_removed,this is a direct fujita quote taken from his wikipedia page as fujita himself noted i am not so great a puncher not so great a kicker i dont really have anything all that great but in todays vale tudo the strongest is the one that can take a beating
MMA,not_removed,im missing an inside joke here as its been a long time since he was around and prolific but damn i miss that guy i used to buy egm just for his pieces on the back page and then when i got into mma around or i was floored to find out he also was cracking jokes there too
MMA,not_removed,you mean kangaroo meat
MMA,not_removed,youre assuming theres anything inside fujitas head besides a smaller identical fujita skull
MMA,not_removed,yeah its no surprise hes got serious issues one of those guys too tough for their own good
MMA,not_removed,gary goodridge has a of cte though
MMA,not_removed,httpwwwcrackedcomblogworstlifeeverthestoryofkazuyukifujitasskull
MMA,not_removed,seanbaby wrote for egm im trying to recall what he did i read egm in but i was in elementary dont remember much
MMA,not_removed,its fujitas all the way down
MMA,not_removed,yeah he had a monthly column on the back page called rest of the crap about really bad games that nobody wanted to review he also did podcasts with i miss those days
MMA,not_removed,i remember now i remember the page layout but i wasnt sure what it was called in the back of my head i was thinking it was that i recall one for a fairly oddparents game that i really enjoyed at the time
MMA,not_removed,his debut was at ufc on fuel not
MMA,not_removed,who wouldve known he was gonna be one of the worlds most popular athletes within a couple of years
MMA,not_removed,how many times does this need to be posted
MMA,not_removed,wow he sounded like such an airhead back then hes changed and matured a lot with the way he talks
MMA,not_removed,look at the threads on sherdog made after this debut everyone literally started calling him the goat right away
MMA,not_removed,he was clearly nervous talking to dana
MMA,not_removed,the evolution of mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,one of my good friends has been training with bigfoot down in florida so im actually kind of second hand excited for this keep living the dream bigfoot do your thing
MMA,not_removed,man for his sake i wish he would just hang em up
MMA,not_removed,pulling for ko losses in a row
MMA,not_removed,rsadcringe
MMA,not_removed,i guess cte doesnt matter to cavemen
MMA,not_removed,ill watch
MMA,not_removed,they will give him a win after he debuts and loses against someone with no fights so they can have him get his ass kicked for again like they did with maldonado
MMA,not_removed,my buddy was his training partner for the fedor fight and he always had nice things to say about him im glad hes still fighting
MMA,not_removed,for his sake i hope he does whatever the hell he wants hes doing what he loves
MMA,not_removed,do you mind going into why
MMA,not_removed,nah this is roids bigfoot
MMA,not_removed,youre being downvoted but youre absolutely right the guy is following his passion to fight he couldve opened up an mma gym in brazil long ago good for him
MMA,not_removed,ko losses in his last fights ko losses overall and his last fight was god awful
MMA,not_removed,its not that people dont want him to follow his passion its that theyre legitimately concerned about his health same reason i never want to see bj fight again i didnt want to after his last frankie fight and i definitely dont want to after that fight with rodriguez
MMA,not_removed,he got for his last fight that goes a long way for retirement
MMA,not_removed,perhaps a nice diet of russian cuisine will help
MMA,not_removed,dont watch then
MMA,not_removed,you dont have to see these guys fight and they dont have to fight if they dont want to they arent coerced you arent coerced bigfoot is making a small fortune to fight i think hes pretty willing and hes the captain of his own ship
MMA,not_removed,cant do much with when you can barely speak because your brain is mashed potatoes
MMA,not_removed,im just throwing out the other side of the argument bro yes ultimately it is up to the fighter but that doesnt mean we cant be concerned with their health id hate to see a young sport like mma have their vets ending up punchy
MMA,not_removed,hes going to go back to overusing trt and beating the shit out of people
MMA,not_removed,hes living his martial arts to the fullest thats whats important hes doing what he wants to with the time he has on this earth as are any of us life expectancy for people with his condition acromegaly is years shorter so its good hes living his dreams hes actually an inspiration in that way in a professional sense even with all the losses hes positioned to be making more money than ever because hes fighting in russia and is one of three men to actually beat the greatest mma fighter of all time fedor emelianenko its good to be bigfoot right now especially as efn doesnt appear to drugtest trtfoot is back
MMA,not_removed,dude its mma you end up punchy thats how this works they know that
MMA,not_removed,it actually seems to have he was eating mark hunt punches for rounds on trt but afterwards you could touch his chin and put him out
MMA,not_removed,trt absolutely helped big foots chin
MMA,not_removed,higher levels of testosterone help with almost everything combat related except fight iq
MMA,not_removed,dr science first name bro
MMA,not_removed,the division is really small and shes a monster
MMA,not_removed,she also does steroids and cant compete in the ufc since she wouldnt pass testing
MMA,not_removed,shes got a body built by peds
MMA,not_removed,everyones favorite mma manager ali scoops up another high profile client
MMA,not_removed,i cant wait for all the sweet rumble tweets sent from alis twitter
MMA,not_removed,lol glenn robinson was on the youre welcome podcast and he was talking about how nobody in this industry is loyal except few guys like anthony johnson ouch
MMA,not_removed,breaking clinton jackson has a date
MMA,not_removed,robinson reportedly said that one johnson retires he will stop managing fighters altogether ariel asked rumble about it and rumble didnt seem too pleased by that i know theres been some drama at blackzilians so that mixed with the robinson comments makes me think glenn gon call it quits
MMA,not_removed,just why
MMA,not_removed,getting that khabib money
MMA,not_removed,he is the dick pill guy right
MMA,not_removed,aziz light
MMA,not_removed,httpwwwdominancemmacomclientsphp
MMA,not_removed,guy seems scummy
MMA,not_removed,was he the one doing frankies tweets
MMA,not_removed,glenn robinson was on the youre welcome podcast and he was talking about how nobody in this industry is loyal what do you expect when you basically paid guys to break their ties with their former gym thats like after a girl cheated on her boyfriend with you now youre surprised she cheated on you as well
MMA,not_removed,glenn robinson is trying to rebuild a team after blackzillions split up he talks about things like loyalty and friendship ali talks about money
MMA,not_removed,thats malki kawa
MMA,not_removed,generally viewed as a shady guy there was some wild story that he used to be an fbi informant he also managed wsof fighters while being an executive i think actually the matchmaker at wsof major conflict of interest theres more stuff too i think he also logged into frankie edgars twitter account and started talking some really bad trash talk he talks a lot of shit and annoys people
MMA,not_removed,sultan aliev and luke rockhold are the same person
MMA,not_removed,no love as well you would think he would put cody on his list of clients since he is the bantamweight champ lol
MMA,not_removed,oh for fucks sake kayla goddammnit
MMA,not_removed,dafuq so many gracies everywhere
MMA,not_removed,i love how keith jardine is buried at the bottom and looks none too pleased about it
MMA,not_removed,yes among others
MMA,not_removed,blackzillian gym is still open according to glenn
MMA,not_removed,whats wrong with being a former fbi informant
MMA,not_removed,have you seen the front page of that website they have stories in years and half of them are about ali its not a reputable site at all
MMA,not_removed,how else did kayla sign with wsof
MMA,not_removed,renzo gracie gave ali his start and gave him serious mma contacts i think he started managing renzos family members when they tried mma
MMA,not_removed,he posted a picture of himself cody and dana on khabibs ig lol
MMA,not_removed,snitches get stitches
MMA,not_removed,did you not read the article if youre made into an informant there is a pretty high chance youre a shitstain that is being used to catch worse shitstains
MMA,not_removed,very often informants are already involved in shadycriminalimmoral activity and are simply coopted by the fbi afterwards
MMA,not_removed,damn ali has so many social media accounts though amirite so many accounts
MMA,not_removed,sup ali
MMA,not_removed,thats one journalists website he runs it generally seen as a reputable guy but ali threatens bigger mma outlets if they pick up on the story to black them out to his stable of fighters fighters who are managed by him seem to like him a bit so regardless of shadiness he does his job
MMA,not_removed,i just didnt have it click until seeing her name on that site sigh
MMA,not_removed,not if anthony johnson is standing next to him
MMA,not_removed,generally seen as a reputable guy generally seen by who you the guy has a hateboner for ali and is practically stalking him on his website and on twitter there seems to be some personal problem between the two or something his obsession with ali is not normal
MMA,not_removed,thats one journalists website he runs it generally seen as a reputable guy but ali threatens bigger mma outlets if they pick up on the story to black them out to his stable of fighters fighters who are managed by him seem to like him a bit so regardless of shadiness he does his job you mean httprealfightstoriescomabout thats the reputable guy whose picture shows up under different names by doing a simple google image search go ahead please try it for your self i have a hard time imaging this former ex terrorist is now just a wellknown fight manager working hand in hand with an mma company whose quite friendly with the trump administration at a time when were supposedly trying to weed out potential terrorists
MMA,not_removed,yoga mat in hand
MMA,not_removed,no it isnt it is accurate especially in this particular case
MMA,not_removed,lol his peers
MMA,not_removed,it comes up because thats his google plus image and he is in their circles he lied about the olympics and doesnt hold a managers license in any state by any commission
MMA,not_removed,i have no idea why i find ridiculously long links hilarious but this is one of the finest ive ever seen
MMA,not_removed,i knew it would be ridiculous because it was a google link
MMA,not_removed,link it correctly then like
MMA,not_removed,nah
MMA,not_removed,the only way gsp cheated was by hiring that guy to kiss bj penn
MMA,not_removed,the gsp hate is strong in this one
MMA,not_removed,breaking news
MMA,not_removed,what ended up happening with georges any repercussions
MMA,not_removed,grease st pierre
MMA,not_removed,what fight was that in
MMA,not_removed,im starting to think youre in love with gsp this kind of obsession is unhealthy
MMA,not_removed,to most of the people on this sub it probably is
MMA,not_removed,bjs mom went in front of the commission and the nsac decided to do nothing about it
MMA,not_removed,never mind googled it it was from ufc gsp vs bj
MMA,not_removed,the music on that is great see
MMA,not_removed,hes potentially coming back so people are sucking him off hard right now
MMA,not_removed,loraine is an absolute sweetheart but shes a bit of a helicopter mom
MMA,not_removed,i will never not watch this
MMA,not_removed,this gets posted every hour cmon now
MMA,not_removed,i dont care that this is posted all the time its easily the goat mma interview
MMA,not_removed,wow what an interesting find that no one has ever posted here before
MMA,not_removed,i can probably transcribe this from memory but i will continue to upvote it forever
MMA,not_removed,to be fair not often as its own post someone posts a link in the comments every time theres anything about forrest or this fight and usually a fair few people respond saying theyve never heard it so its probably just one of those people posting it
MMA,not_removed,sorry i dont post often or have the time to look at the sub as much as i want saw it on my facebook feed and decided to share
MMA,not_removed,haha its all good buddy ð
MMA,not_removed,your move hitler
MMA,not_removed,exactly how many ways can tim kennedy kill a man
MMA,not_removed,aug at utc i received my professor stripes today as a black belt im proud to be part of this team i have been a dedicated martial artists for almost years every time i received a new black belt or was promoted i learned how much harder i have to work to deserve to wear it this is no different it is humbling and inspiring on one side of my belt in japanese it has my name and on the other it says green beret i will cherish this belt till the day i die httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,well deserved tims bjj is seriously underrated he handled roger gracie
MMA,not_removed,professor stripes
MMA,not_removed,he mentioned his army career again like its his only interesting feature
MMA,not_removed,wow and how do you think he got that good at jiujitsu steroids obviously amirite guys
MMA,not_removed,your move isis
MMA,not_removed,dude hitler is a killer man great match up
MMA,not_removed,how many ways has tim kennedy killed a man
MMA,not_removed,walking down rodeo with a shotgun
MMA,not_removed,the white stripes on the edges of the red strip of the belt signifies he is a teacher they call them professors in brazil
MMA,not_removed,look out man i say the same thing and got buried abandon hope
MMA,not_removed,no he mentioned as its a huge part of his life and an incredibly difficult thing to become a green beret
MMA,not_removed,well nam phan is a black belt and got handled on the ground by dennis siver so theres that
MMA,not_removed,most likely just with guns but maybe a knife thrown in here or there
MMA,not_removed,yeah i know that but that isnt a promotion is it you switch to that after you open your own school
MMA,not_removed,yea i know he brings it up every interview he is in
MMA,not_removed,listen to him on the jocko podcast he goes into detail
MMA,not_removed,every stripe on the black belt is kind of like a promotion usually get them every years for the first stripes so they are essentially a new belt but it is more of a formal process instead of a skill based promotion the professor stripes are essentially your first stripe on the black belt
MMA,not_removed,what is your problem with it
MMA,not_removed,is there a link
MMA,not_removed,i dont think you are right about that but maybe different places do different things
MMA,not_removed,my problem is he brings it up so often it must be his only interesting feature
MMA,not_removed,there isnt so much a time stamp because they just discuss war throughout the entire podcast but its all excellent anyway not even exaggerating when i say jocko will change your life if you listen
MMA,not_removed,what part
MMA,not_removed,it must be hard being you
MMA,not_removed,his book is the one must buy book of the past couple years jocko for president and that is not a joke
MMA,not_removed,the first stripe thing there is the blackbelt with the white area i think it is seen as a blackbelt competitor but i think you can wear a blackbelt with the red also if you are coaching too i am guessing that wherever this school is they have a special designation or something for this
MMA,not_removed,yea its pretty tough everytime i see tim kennedy i have to hear about how hes an army rangergreen beret
MMA,not_removed,it does depend on the school but the first stripe is usually the professor stripes if they are a teachercoach at the school if they are not then sometimes they just a stripe on there or whatever the white bar is used by competitors we have some guys that like to use the white bar when they compete my professor is a degree black belt his belt has the professor bars and stripes in between he also recently awarded our main black belt teacher besides himself the professor stripes similar as tim in this thread
MMA,not_removed,the reason the first stripe is the professor stripe is because you can promote people to black belt once you get that first stripe
MMA,not_removed,yeah the guy who only trains and fights talking about training and fighting fucking lame
MMA,not_removed,interesting i have to look at my coaches belts i think they just rock black and red with stripes like normal even the guy that has like stripes
MMA,not_removed,ok that makes sense
MMA,not_removed,and who is being interviewed on shows about fighting or his service
MMA,not_removed,if he isnt talking about how everyone is on steroids complaining about yoel romero or mentioning his army career yea he does that
MMA,not_removed,well at least he is up to things instead of just that
MMA,not_removed,of all the guys on the planet to start shit with
MMA,not_removed,it makes you wonder why people can be so delusional as to think that they should try to start a fight with a pro fighter i have always found it strange that people will assume they are good at fighting even if they havent practiced it at all
MMA,not_removed,he got into a fistfight with a heavyweight at a regional event once
MMA,not_removed,some of the hoodlum shit cowboy brags about crosses a few lines i reckon talking about kicking a drunk guy in the head is a little harsh when youre an elite pro and should know better i really love him fighting but hocking the worst beer on the market laughing about alleged assaults and being homophobic are hardly positive traits
MMA,not_removed,haha really though
MMA,not_removed,you guys trying to be ufc fighters or something little did that idiot know
MMA,not_removed,i think its partly human instinct to have some amount of confidence in your ability to defend yourself if put in harms way i call this instinct stupid and delusional
MMA,not_removed,or any pro athlete people done realize these guys arent normal humans they are genetic freaks who compete against other genetic freaks their speed power and accuracy is not anything like your every day joes
MMA,not_removed,lol of course cowboy would fight a heavyweight crazy mofo
MMA,not_removed,talking about kicking a drunk guy yes after he tried to punch him in the face
MMA,not_removed,the dude literally crashed into their boat and was being a dick all day i would also argue that he was putting everyone on cowboys boat in danger and the cherry on top was shouting at his girlfriend he is lucky that all he got was a light head kick
MMA,not_removed,he head kicked him out of self defence when did he brag about being a homophobe lol you really hold someones beer preference against them on a personal level
MMA,not_removed,hocking the worst beer on the market damn personal taste is objective now when did this happen
MMA,not_removed,i live up north and us canadians love budweiser well to be fair well drink just about anything
MMA,not_removed,keystone coors light busch beg to differ
MMA,not_removed,budweiser is alright
MMA,not_removed,thats expecting someone who goes by the name cowboy to be eloquent or refined
MMA,not_removed,what has he done that is homophobic saying the f word doesnt make you homophobic
MMA,not_removed,i think he knew they were fighters and targeted them because of that matt serra had a really funny one when they were filming looking for a fight some dude just came by and asked wtf he was looking at serra just laughed and told the dude to look for a fight down the street because he would find a safer fight there
MMA,not_removed,donald cerrone talking about his friend being thrown by a judoka p
MMA,not_removed,fair enough i thought it was crass when i heard it repeatedly using homophobic language never said he bragged just that he does it preference of not relentlessly shilling your sponsors everywhere you go is bloody annoying just like the myprotien instagram takeover of every fighter ever dont begrudge them making some money but the could do it in a bit more of a subtle way sometimes
MMA,not_removed,nah dude hes sponsored by bud nothing personal its unanimously awful
MMA,not_removed,love that you guys arent picky youve even turned chips and gravy into cuisine great work
MMA,not_removed,coors light has an incredibly important role in being the beer served with ice for middle aged housewives doesnt pretend to be anything else either so fair enough busch is the same company as bud keystone i have to hold my hands up to never heard of it
MMA,not_removed,in england hed be called farmer cerrone not as cool
MMA,not_removed,he did get caught saying a homophobic remark at a post fight press conference
MMA,not_removed,apart from the fact it absolutely does make you homophobic he used it in a perjorative context and has specifically referenced a defective bodily function as a condition of homosexuality i like the guy as a fighter but he needs to have a word with himself about the language he uses sometimes
MMA,not_removed,i am not a fan but you saying it is awful is plain ignorant people have different tastes some guys love bud and its their favorite just like some people like hardcore ipas that taste like mud
MMA,not_removed,arent you from england
MMA,not_removed,oh i was just referring to specific types of beer he promotes budweiser and budweiser alone i wasnt including subsidiary beers of the parent company my apologies
MMA,not_removed,whats the best beer in the world then you are obviously the absolute authority on the matter please mold my stupid brain
MMA,not_removed,gosh go back to your safe space
MMA,not_removed,if the majority agree its awful theres substance behind that ironically something budweiser doesnt have
MMA,not_removed,wait what guys love bud agree on the weird american ipa thing though how that can take a beer type and go that far off track is beyond me
MMA,not_removed,apparently so but hes from london so hes clearly better than the rest of us peasants
MMA,not_removed,majority agree so much that it is still the number one selling beer in the us i think its time to leave the reddit bubble
MMA,not_removed,yes there are millions of men and women that love bud
MMA,not_removed,what im praising the fact that canada has made a cornerstone of english food into a trend meaning we can eat it more maybe you need some gravy for the chip on the shoulder
MMA,not_removed,the us doesnt represent the world time to leave that narrow minded bubble
MMA,not_removed,really i though it was popular because of it being cheap and tasteless like carlting or fosters nobody would drink it if they had a free choice surely
MMA,not_removed,we were talking within the context of the us you objectively say the majority think it is awful is retarded no matter what context it is in
MMA,not_removed,dude are you from america if not i understand you not knowing but if you are american you either need to leave your house or get off reddit
MMA,not_removed,granted you were speaking in regard of the us but as a european i can assure you that budweiser is unilaterally derided outside of america the only reason it is so popular in the us is because of marketing power due to it being a very old symbol of modern america and poor general taste if you can find proof of any other countries where it is popular ill hold my hands up
MMA,not_removed,erm see username but even when travelling in the us ive rarely seen people drink bud unless it was literally free or the only thing in the shop this is true of lots of countries though shit mass produced bumwash gets popular because marketing
MMA,not_removed,as a european i can assure you that budweiser is unilaterally derided outside of america europe doesnt represent the world you should get out of that narrow minded bubblelol and here you go
MMA,not_removed,its a popular beer in china one of their biggest imported nb beers that doesnt say much as the chinese drink shit beer nonstop most countries ive been too the most popular beer is a farcry from the best
MMA,not_removed,and it doesnt even need to be bad sierra nevada is an awesome mass produced craft beer all about standards
MMA,not_removed,its perfectly acceptable cheap beer no worse than heineken or any european massproduced lager pilsner
MMA,not_removed,indeed though the very fact that budweiser and bud light are top sellers honestly makes me question the integrity of that article then again im a cynic
MMA,not_removed,i can give you a dozen links that say the same its ok man people like bud youll get over it
MMA,not_removed,sigh i suppose
MMA,not_removed,dude its refreshing and cold and cheap sometimes thats all i want lots of others too apparently
MMA,not_removed,ive been minority reported
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,the shittiest shit post
MMA,not_removed,this sub would turn into sherdog
MMA,not_removed,it would define the mcgregor era
MMA,not_removed,what do you mean
MMA,not_removed,conor cannot fight at welterweight he himself said that he doesnt feel as muscular at that weight class conor is a natural lightweight and a big featherweight but hes a really small welterweight and anyone in the top could have their way with conor it would be career suicide to pursue a welterweight title because the hype around him comes from the fact that hes seemingly unstoppable thats his whole reason for pursuing the diaz rematch to reignite that hype either one of thompson woodley and the other big names in the division condit lawler gastelum hell even cerrone at welterweight would all demolish conor i cannot see him ever taking that big a risk unless he was sure he could win which he most likely cant
MMA,not_removed,if my memory serves me well maia was on a win streak that punch was clean as it gets
MMA,not_removed,nate such a stand up guy in that fight he pulls back his punch cause he knows its over sometimes i get sick of seeing people continue when they fight is obviously over i know they are taught to go to the bell but still there are honorable guys that will stop before they seriously injure the other person maia does this when he goes for chokessubs it is pretty obvious when he has something he slowly finishes it because he knows its over and he always lets go immediately i wish more people were like this so that we could see more fights out of people
MMA,not_removed,anytime anyone ever gets a big win one of their losses gets posted here afterwards strange phenomenon
MMA,not_removed,nates also only guy to stop tyron
MMA,not_removed,mercyful nate
MMA,not_removed,in my opinion anderson silva beating on him and making fun of him was worse then being stopped
MMA,not_removed,this was during maias illadvised kick boxing phase glad he went back to his roots
MMA,not_removed,my jiu jitsu teammates i had floor passes were giddy watching maia enter reaching for hand slaps from him in eager anticipation of the technical jiu jitsu display we were about to witness nate had other ideas at least we still had hometown hero randy coutures impending victory to bask in great night of fight tho
MMA,not_removed,anderson couldve finished him if he wanted
MMA,not_removed,this was my first live event going in it was probably the best match up on the card maia was a rising top contender and nate was in his prime i really thought maia would give him fits lost my shit when it happened awesome night
MMA,not_removed,and then there was the total disaster that was the maia vs silva fight
MMA,not_removed,fuark you could hear that thud
MMA,not_removed,the days when maia gave a shit about his stand up are over
MMA,not_removed,nate used to be so fucking scary dude
MMA,not_removed,every time i hear damian maia is fighting i just remember this and think how much he sucks obviously not the case but this knockout is always the first thing i think of
MMA,not_removed,i hit you in the fucking head boom there goes your black belt mark hunt
MMA,not_removed,nog vs couture on this card was fucking awesome their final flurry was insane
MMA,not_removed,his soul was knockout out of him
MMA,not_removed,god that was rough
MMA,not_removed,gotta give it to him he improved alot since then even in the striking its good enough to set up take downs but weve seen he can lose like when he fought rory and shields
MMA,not_removed,wow maias progression in stand up is pretty remarkable in this clip he just stands in front of marquardt like a sitting duck against condit he was using feints and movement to bait condit and open himself up for a takedown
MMA,not_removed,guess who was damians striking coach this fight wanderli silva i dont think that helped
MMA,not_removed,ended up watching his mcdonald fight yesterday and remembering how he got totally handled hilarious that now hes gonna be up for a title shot while rory didnt get resigned edit who the fuck down votes a comment like that ive been noticing this trend lately of people making basic statements nothing too controversial and getting down voted to hell thats some pathetic bullshit right there cant wait for school to start
MMA,not_removed,im never going to forget that it took a while for damien to get his soul back
MMA,not_removed,this fight altered history for me i only really remember two maia fights his enter my triangle over sonnen and this fight nate knocked him dead so quick i thought hed been stopped by strikes a bunch of times
MMA,not_removed,maya
MMA,not_removed,marquardt is so juiced up here its crazy
MMA,not_removed,so satisfying
MMA,not_removed,at that point if i remember correctly
MMA,not_removed,nate wasis such a weird fighter hes either fucking spectacular or awful no in between
MMA,not_removed,it looks like he did more damage headbutting the floor than he got from the punch
MMA,not_removed,i think maia learned something from that fight
MMA,not_removed,i agree i cant stand to see people get hammerfisted by a flying opponent after theyre clearly done its not good for the sport and yes i understand the fog of war and adrenaline and excitement all that sometimes i wish the refs could jump in quickly there are a lot of examples two examples of dangerous fight conclusions first holly holms hammerfisting of a clearly kod ronda rousey from a standing drop was dangerous second bigfoot silva playing heavy bag with an outonhisfeet overeems head was dangerous im not casting blame but both situations were very dangerous and perhaps could have been prevented or not with closer more involved reffing mark hunts walkof kos are only possible because he has very intense focus and remains calm even when getting whipped he has great fight awareness and just knows when a follow up is not necessary plus hes not exactly quick on his feet or keen to go to the ground anyway tldr give ufc refs a loud whistle or air horn they can sound when they rule a match is concluded also ufc rules and customs will continue to change with time to improve fighter safety its inevitable
MMA,not_removed,yeah that was class
MMA,not_removed,while i agree all it takes is one knockdown you dont finish where you end up losing a decision to have motivation to play basketball with peoples heads on the canvas
MMA,not_removed,maia is quick with that never noticed til u said so
MMA,not_removed,jon jones choking lyoto was nasty he said post fight he knew he was out but held on anyways
MMA,not_removed,that isnt why he pulled that punch he said in an interview he didnt want to hit maia again because he thought it might wake him up
MMA,not_removed,maia also stopped punching and ended the fight himself once he realized dhk was injured everything about him is a consimute gentleman
MMA,not_removed,nate such a stand up guy in that fight he pulls back his punch cause he knows its over well that and it clearly would have been an illegal strike directly to his brain stem
MMA,not_removed,agreed i personally also like it when fighters aim for the hands instead of trying to land shots on their opponents face when they know theyre finished example that comes to mind is overeem vs lesnar
MMA,not_removed,i see no difference between paul harris cranking a heel hook for a second longer than he should and guys throwing extra shots after the guy is already out
MMA,not_removed,he steps away because he knew it was over he pulls his punch because it would be to the back of the head and illegal
MMA,not_removed,i cant help but laugh when the sensitive dudes that complain that i fight until the ref steps in incase it wasnt obvious enough im a head hunting true fighter that reacts on killer instinct not the pussy martial artist begging refs to stop the fight im going hard with the will to win no matter if im winning or losing and the only thing stopping me is the sound of the bell or the ref pulling me off if you are one of those sensitive dudes that cant handle a savage fight dont watch and stick to cricket golf or video games its as simple as that headhunter everyoneknowswhatsupwhenimlockedinthecage
MMA,not_removed,i think it has more to do with the hype its interesting to see a fighter whos been looking unstoppable get demolished adds perspective edit also shows how much theyve improved like rda getting uppercutted or mcgregor getting tapped
MMA,not_removed,its sobering i like it
MMA,not_removed,haters come out in full force once they lose money on a bet its the only salvation for the subhuman
MMA,not_removed,hellbows and an uppercut from the depths brutal
MMA,not_removed,sick reference bro
MMA,not_removed,i swear anderson had bet on himself winning via ud or something it was a surreal fight
MMA,not_removed,that pic looks worse than it was maia blew his nose inflating his eye weird but true edit he also landed on silva somehow
MMA,not_removed,ehhhhh maia actually won the last round because of the antics really didnt make maia look bad as much as it made silva look really odd
MMA,not_removed,silva was a total dick during this fight he was calling him names during the fight gesturing like maia was a craven and when the crowd started supporting maia silva started running from him hiding behind the referee
MMA,not_removed,are you sure i remember it being this fight and maybe the anderson fight that spurred him into that phase he was on a five fight submission streak coming into this one admittedly i dont remember any specific interviews or media from that time that says this its just how it goes in my memory
MMA,not_removed,a lot of that had to do with his strength deficit at mw his takedowns are much more effective at ww
MMA,not_removed,rory chose bellator over ufc its not like the ufc wouldnt have resigned him
MMA,not_removed,rory is one of the best wrestlers at with striking to match
MMA,not_removed,it is isnt it
MMA,not_removed,i thought this was right after silva
MMA,not_removed,that wasnt even his most badass ko the walkoff against the current ufc welterweight champ
MMA,not_removed,he was the guy at mw for a couple years even though he was a bit undersized between coming to the ufc and the fight with chael he looked pretty unstoppable when he wasnt fighting anderson silva and that was a year period
MMA,not_removed,but the finesse of that punch is just beautiful to watch
MMA,not_removed,hendobisping
MMA,not_removed,gegard mousasi rarely finishes fights with unnecessary strikes i think it speaks to how composed and in control some fighters are like mark hunt who are able to immediately recognise when its over and pull back
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor slamming hammerfists onto aldo while he was laying on the ground not moving was hard to watch also big john got there fairly quickly though
MMA,not_removed,i guess im more forgiving of the after ko shots before the ref gets there call it especially if it comes from the massive underdog fighter like in the rondaholm fight if you were holly and you managed to rock your opponent that no one really has come close to finishing would you stop your attack before the ref stopped it no you wouldnt holly and bigfoot probably couldnt believe what they just did and didnt waste that rare opportunity
MMA,not_removed,i guess im more forgiving of the after ko shots before the ref gets there call it especially if it comes from the massive underdog fighter like in the rondaholm fight if you were holly and you managed to rock your opponent that no one really has come close to finishing would you stop your attack before the ref stopped it no you wouldnt holly and bigfoot probably couldnt believe what they just did and didnt waste that rare opportunity
MMA,not_removed,mark hunts walkof kos are only possible because he has very intense focus and remains calm even when getting whipped that and he fought in sports that dont allow ground strikes every ko is a walkoff
MMA,not_removed,rhonda wasnt actually out until holly hit her with a hammerfist she was beat up and got flashed on the kick but she wasnt out yet the ref did the best he could on that one imo if you want an example of a ref not paying attention that steele slam ko of kim might be the worst kim is out and steele hits him with like nasty elbows before the ref even realizes kim is out
MMA,not_removed,for what its worth ubereem wasnt avoiding his brocks face so much as purposely punching his body he had been destroying brock with knees to the body that fight and was trying to do more damage i think it was brocks first fight after surgery too
MMA,not_removed,besides the fact that the ref is yanking on him and the opponent tapping frantically a knocked out guy cant tap or scream at the ref
MMA,not_removed,paul harris lmao
MMA,not_removed,i dont get all your downvotes exhibit httpwwwmmaweeklycommarquardttestspositiveforsteroids have an upvote
MMA,not_removed,haters is that how you interpreted this post i figured op was a maia fan
MMA,not_removed,i was actually curious if anyone would even get it glad someone did
MMA,not_removed,ya if he wanted to he could have ended that on multiple occasions iirc it had to do with anderson being upset with the ufc at the time and resenting maia for growing up privileged
MMA,not_removed,silva really should have gotten a point taken but for some reason all he got was a warning after twenty minutes of nonsense
MMA,not_removed,people say his wrestling and judo have improved heaps as well and even though hes kind of feinting here he doesnt have a strikers vibe to his movements meaning nate was probably expecting a straight takedown with little setup maia has learned enough striking to give good enough impression against guys like brown and condit he gets them keep their hands up and probably somehow exploit their stance to get that single leg
MMA,not_removed,the ufc wasnt offering anything significant im just saying its weird because he still has the ability to put on some exciting fights and beat some top talent they definitely let him get away
MMA,not_removed,ufc didnt want to resign him if they did they wouldve gave him whatever bellator gave him
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah i love rory but i still find it weird that he moved promotions and they let him get away
MMA,not_removed,no after this he fought dan miller then filled in to fight silva at
MMA,not_removed,one of my all time favourite finishes when hes on form nates combos are just beautiful to watch
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,was he undersized in those days i always remember nate looking like a tank next to his opponent
MMA,not_removed,i think that finish was more pent up aggression from the ultimate fighter than going until the ref stops it
MMA,not_removed,big john got there fairly quick and landed a final knee to aldos computer dont forget
MMA,not_removed,yeah man im not blaming either fighter just pointing out some obvious situations people may remember where a ref may have stepped in quicker there are some fights where fighters took it too far and refs didnt di their jobs though sometimes a combination of both thankfully its very rare
MMA,not_removed,hmm maybe i should rewatch but as i recall he was punching the hands for a while and when the ref didnt end it he went to the body
MMA,not_removed,yeah but a knocked out guy is a guy that is knocked out
MMA,not_removed,lmao i didnt realize he meant palhares until this comment
MMA,not_removed,it was a jeremy lil heathen stephens quote
MMA,not_removed,care to explain
MMA,not_removed,yeah hes definitely improved so much its pretty cool seeing a world class guy grow so much even pretty late into his
MMA,not_removed,thats fine i dont disagree with you there but im arguing the fact that the ufc would have resigned him just not for the amount that rory wanted
MMA,not_removed,not mad at that michael page fight
MMA,not_removed,who is that in there with him
MMA,not_removed,he moved down to ww i know he struggled with the bigger mws like anderson chael and okami he was smaller then franklin and bisping but they never fought the mw division has definitely gotten bigger since then he was probably fairly average for the time but the biggest guys seemed to have some size on him
MMA,not_removed,dan does that to all opponents though look at what he did to lombard i think it is definitely more of a go until the ref stops it mentality
MMA,not_removed,i believe i for a little while i dont know if hell ever shut his mouth completely though normally im not that way in fights i know if a guy is out i tend to stop i knew i hit him out i think that last one was just to shut him up a little bit henderson backed away from that after the fight but those were his words to joe right after the fight
MMA,not_removed,to aldos computer fuck your motherboard
MMA,not_removed,i think you watched a different fight than i did
MMA,not_removed,a knocked out dazed guy can potentially regain his senses and resume fighting its happened loads of times in mma with a sub you cant take back your tap especially if the ref already stepped in and its on video what palhares did was way worse
MMA,not_removed,lmao
MMA,not_removed,i completely forgot about that i guess it didnt catch on as well as mark hunts rant
MMA,not_removed,i think he made in his last fight do you think thats enough how much do you think they offered him give me seems worth at least but then again maybe his best is behind him i dont know
MMA,not_removed,rory picked the better deal if the ufc wanted to they couldve easily matched whatever bellator offered rory easily they didnt they dont want him its clear as day the thompson fight was the biggest fuck you fight if i ever saw one rorys beat the champ and the number or contendermaia in ufcs ww division and they let him go smart
MMA,not_removed,well well see if it happens people keep saying that mvp is protected and he only gets cans to fight so i doubt they will throw him in with rory right away somebody else somewhere said rory was targeting or summer return so we may have to wait a while
MMA,not_removed,wow thats pretty shitty of you
MMA,not_removed,wilson gouveia
MMA,not_removed,he was a huge welterweight but is average sized at middleweight i think his next fight against the barn cat might be his last fight at least in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,this is true i forgot about that one pride never dies but hector does dan henderson
MMA,not_removed,except for dan said he did it on purpose to bisping due to the mouthing off all the time on tuf
MMA,not_removed,i am going to hit this guy while he cant feel it thatll show him
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpxuhtpgiumg secs
MMA,not_removed,bro the amount the ufc or belator offered rory is not the argument here the argument is if the ufc gave rory an offer regardless of the pay amount im arguing that the ufc gave rory an offer your initial argument is that they did not
MMA,not_removed,i dont think its fair to say they didnt want him maybe they felt he wasnt worth the money bellator was offering but that doesnt mean they didnt want him rory is one of the best ww in the world but every fighter has number that the ufc isnt willing to pay even mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,no not really watch the fight and the loudest source of noise above all elements present was tyrons mother screaming non stop for the whole fight lets go tyron he aint got shit for ya beat his assect
MMA,not_removed,he gives up height and reach to pretty much every top mw
MMA,not_removed,it wasnt like it was a definitive answer it was basically to entertain the interviewer he said sure maybe it was a little payback for tuf i doubt in the midst of all that adrenaline he was thinking yea just one more punch for that tuf season
MMA,not_removed,i remember that fight just fine its the other one that udialmformostyn described that i dont remember
MMA,not_removed,from what i gather they tried to resign him before he fought his last fight on the contract and he didnt like what they were offering thinking that if he won the wonderboy fight he would force their hand when he lost that fight that offer might have even vanished im not sure all i know is that bellator offered him easier fights and more money their lower tier fighters make less than the ufc so they can afford to overpay for some name guys like mcdonald davis henderson etc
MMA,not_removed,knowing the ufc they probably low balled him and not only is rory one the best fighters at hell be one the best fighters at for some time and in that time half of the ufc ww division will be retired bad move by the ufc if they wanted rory they wouldve kept him
MMA,not_removed,its the same fight big john hits aldo with his knee as he runs to push mcgregor off
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure that mccarthy never landed a knee to aldos computer during that fight sorry i didnt realize that i would have to spell it out i was trying to push in the direction of the computer typo
MMA,not_removed,yes he did
MMA,not_removed,in case you are not doing it on purpose computer his headbrain
MMA,not_removed,i understood that but had a really funny picture in my head of a laptop replacing aldos head and giving off a puff of smoke after the mccarthy knee i thought other people would have a similar mental image to put it into computer terms it was an error on my part
MMA,not_removed,im in mma battle card game sounds like a lot of fun
MMA,not_removed,as a big mtg fan this is badass mcgregor needs trample though and rousey needs to stay tapped for an extra turn after attacking
MMA,not_removed,i was bored and to be honest my mma knowledge is subpar i did this in minutes please add more tips so i can make more when i got proper time d
MMA,not_removed,also mcgregor has deathtouch he touches you and you die
MMA,not_removed,well i think its time for a top opponent wins in a row nobody else at lhw has a streak like that this guy was getting shit on for so long its nice to see him defy the critics
MMA,not_removed,esther lin where you at motherfucker
MMA,not_removed,stahhpppp
MMA,not_removed,i beat up your shampion
MMA,not_removed,vicious
MMA,not_removed,badass
MMA,not_removed,savage fucking savage
MMA,not_removed,edmond imma fight your fucking ass
MMA,not_removed,edmonds face lmao
MMA,not_removed,why shhh him rhonda doesnt listen to him anyway might as well let him yell all he wants
MMA,not_removed,in on collective jizz
MMA,not_removed,what was that about no one calling amanda a poor sport
MMA,not_removed,god i hope esther got a shot of this itll be epic on par with the nate my face is a mask of blood but im flexing cause i won diaz shot
MMA,not_removed,ron u trahmatized meh
MMA,not_removed,dont cry
MMA,not_removed,imagine being the champion and being booed by because youre facing someone who thinks she can beat you in seconds
MMA,not_removed,thats just got to be salty ronda fans reporting it
MMA,not_removed,it was labeled as a shitpost but the community removed it dont get mad at us
MMA,not_removed,nope its a shitpost
MMA,not_removed,i mean you are a mod so ultimately its up to you but if it were my decision id have left it up you guys do a great job so its not a big deal but still its great image and if there is an hq picture of it out there itll be iconic for nunes fans
MMA,not_removed,its always possible we miss things now currently its my bedtime seeing as its soon am so i am off if there is such a thing on the frontpage and i am not saying there isnt then its weird that no one reported it but then again it is the day before new years eve and just getting enough mods to do this event was a bit tricky so if you see shit that does not belong on rmma then report it it aint you shield to break rules cheerio and have a great new years
MMA,not_removed,then have a great new years and i will see ya next week mate
MMA,not_removed,you found out you cant attend the day you purchased the ticket
MMA,not_removed,if you login to your account do you have the option for ticketmaster transfer
MMA,not_removed,so you bought a ticket with the sole intention of selling it for a profit
MMA,not_removed,have someone pay pal you the money you want for it and through ticketmaster you should be able to gift it to them also you could resell it through ticketmaster and if you keep it at face value it will resell real fast i learned all this two months ago when i screwed up the dates to see blink i didnt even want to go to the show but hot chick
MMA,not_removed,does anyone know when you can buy resell tickets on ticketmaster for
MMA,not_removed,no i just got the dates fucked up
MMA,not_removed,not sure where to find that what does that do
MMA,not_removed,no man i just fucked up with the dates
MMA,not_removed,you act like people dont do this all the time why do you think events sell out so fast
MMA,not_removed,login to your ticketmastercom account and where youre ticket for click into and see if you have the transfer this ticket option if you do you could sell the ticket online have someone pay you over paypal and then transfer the ticket from your account to their account
MMA,not_removed,how much are you selling it for
MMA,not_removed,im fine with cost price sec row seat
MMA,not_removed,im thinking lawler thats the only one that really makes sense based off of cowboys hints as well as ranking wise
MMA,not_removed,matt brown
MMA,not_removed,love cowboy the only thing that frustrates me about him is he gets right to the top and seems to overthink the situation and becomes too tentative if he fights lawler hes going to have to bring it
MMA,not_removed,lorenz larkin carlos condit and edson barboza at lightweight those are my only guesses
MMA,not_removed,could be nate considering joe said they already have a posed picture togetherhardly mcgregor paul felder condit thatch
MMA,not_removed,its gotta be lawler it would sell and it would put cowboy on the title contending map if he wins
MMA,not_removed,if its against lawler i hope robbie wins
MMA,not_removed,thats what im thinking too sounds like fireworks
MMA,not_removed,would they feed him someone whos coming off two losses in a row
MMA,not_removed,im down down for that too and i think they trained at musclepharm together at some point maybe
MMA,not_removed,well ill cross my fingers that his new pre fight prep and the mental clarity from skipping the hard weight cut will put him there lord knows hell need it against lawler
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure he was talking about those generic photos with two fighters and a grey background the ones they use to announce a fight like
MMA,not_removed,nate would be pretty phenomenal too at though or
MMA,not_removed,definitely not nate considering hes really a lw nate aint stepping in the cage unless hes getting paid serious dough i think he meant nick anyway
MMA,not_removed,could you imagine if cowboy won hed probably only be a fight away from a title shot
MMA,not_removed,a fight away if he fights and beats lawler he will be the next in line
MMA,not_removed,that line is starting to pile up
MMA,not_removed,i feel like wonderboy lights him up
MMA,not_removed,what about maia and if gsp jumps the line
MMA,not_removed,no doubt but beating the former champ that was the most dominant ww champ since gsp would earn him a shot immediately after thompson theres no way to argue that and you know as well as i do that even the casuals root for cowboy simply because of how often hes been on cards simply put hes a draw and a win over lawler would sell tickets would cowboy deserve it no maia imo should be next in line but the ufc is a business and maia as a possible title holder is not good for the ww division when you look at it from the perspective of putting asses in seats
MMA,not_removed,depends on how cowboy approaches a fight with wonderboy distance and angles are thompsons bread and butter but then again cowboy is comfortable there as well with his kickboxing it would certainly be a very interesting match up and i would love to see it
MMA,not_removed,maia has deserved the shot longer than anyone however hes bad for the division as a champ he doesnt bring casuals in so hes a hard sell if maia wins the title over thompson or woodley i think thats the time that the ufc throws enough money gsps way to hopefully get the title out of maias hands or build him up by beating the best ww to ever grace mma theres no other way that i see the ww division maintaining that much excitement to the causals any other way i think maia could be a very dominant champion it just worries me that if he happens to become one what exactly happens to the draw for that division
MMA,not_removed,true even though i know maia is one of the best in the world i cant see him ever headlining ppv
MMA,not_removed,true i could see those intercepting knees of cerrones coming into play when thompson flashes in for a barrage
MMA,not_removed,was it this fight that giblert pissed hot after
MMA,not_removed,jeez melendez ate that shit like it was nothing
MMA,not_removed,melendez can take an elbowwow
MMA,not_removed,eddie fought of this fight with an eye closed the dude is tough
MMA,not_removed,melendez is tough as fuck as is eddie he got his nose broken in the first round
MMA,not_removed,of all of eddies unflattering split decisions this one i dont agree with alvarez took a clear here
MMA,not_removed,love seeing eddie outheart somebody on steroids
MMA,not_removed,accurate
MMA,not_removed,eddie also only won the rounds he fought with the eye
MMA,not_removed,i think this might be the fight where i learned you dont blow your nose if its broken because itll swell your eye shut
MMA,not_removed,i dont get what you mean you mean that you do agree with the decision or do you think gil won
MMA,not_removed,come on now everyone knows we prefer corn nutsÂ®
MMA,not_removed,steroids
MMA,not_removed,its slang for testing positive for drugs melendez tested positive for testosterone metabolites after his fight with alvarez
MMA,not_removed,when rogan said it i was like eh maybe it swelled a little from blowing no that shit
MMA,not_removed,i who are you
MMA,not_removed,its not the first time hes done that either after his fight with crusher the exact same thing happened and he did exactly the same thing he wasnt allowed to compete in the next round of the tournament either but his eye was gnarly
MMA,not_removed,sorry let me clarify this was a good decision alvarez took a this fight i dont really think that gilbert made a strong case to win this fight and it surprised me that one judge thought he got it i can buy that the michael chandler fight went to split decision i can buy that the anthony pettis fight went to split decision but this one felt like it shouldve been a unanimous decision
MMA,not_removed,jesus you can see the panic in his face
MMA,not_removed,who are you
MMA,not_removed,oh wow
MMA,not_removed,logged in to check rmma and now im watching a video of jim carrey singing the beatles with an orchestra this is a weird day
MMA,not_removed,youre welcome
MMA,not_removed,big tan dan the cheese dorito coloured man
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,good take down defense by daley though
MMA,not_removed,dan got handled badly by zombiemode glover texeira though i think prime mirgs is gone
MMA,not_removed,was there any punishment for that
MMA,not_removed,anybody know dans specs like height weight training lifts etc from the way he moves in the octagon id imagine hes a former wrestler
MMA,not_removed,the most incredible thing about this was that kosheck still managed to walk away as the bad guy literally straight after he goes and insults the local sports team and gsp then struts out one of the best heels the ufc will ever see
MMA,not_removed,hes gotten so much better in the past few years
MMA,not_removed,httpimgurcomlhlnray
MMA,not_removed,dan still cant handle daredevil though im glad he got out of that biker gang
MMA,not_removed,forever soaking up the sun drinking beer on the lake
MMA,not_removed,uh judging from his actions as a coach in tuf this doesnt surprise me at all ive never disliked a fighter as much as koscheck
MMA,not_removed,wow i dont feel that bad for him anymore
MMA,not_removed,why was i expecting
MMA,not_removed,can anyone explain to me what is happening here why did dan just push him out of the air
MMA,not_removed,his worst offenses were the standups in the arlovski v nelson fight and the thompson v kimbo he changed the outcomes of both of them
MMA,not_removed,daley was cut editdana was pissed
MMA,not_removed,trains instructs bjj according to his fb
MMA,not_removed,hes tan tall weighs tan pounds mostly trains under the sun never lifts sunscreen
MMA,not_removed,and daley has been looking pretty sharp lately
MMA,not_removed,you should never feel bad for koscheck but that was completely unacceptable behavior from daley
MMA,not_removed,end of the round iirc
MMA,not_removed,moments like that make me love dana
MMA,not_removed,gotta respect dana on this one you do something as egregious as this with malicious intent you can fuck off to bellator good for dana for not tolerating that
MMA,not_removed,eh kos cheating first makes it acceptable to me
MMA,not_removed,ah that makes sense ive seen it before but never in context haha
MMA,not_removed,i think it was more his attitude after he did it that got him cut dana said that bothered him more
MMA,not_removed,i assume you said the same thing when conor punched nate in the hand
MMA,not_removed,and youre the problem with the fans of this sport hurr he faked so its okay to sucker punch him after the fight you clearly havent ever played a competitive sport in your life or if you did not for long because of your unacceptable attitude towards the sport
MMA,not_removed,does your username stand for average retarded fan
MMA,not_removed,small little things like that hand punches and water bottles can make you a few extra million dollars and make the ufc even more
MMA,not_removed,not even nearly the same thing even nate has defended conor for that
MMA,not_removed,from your clearly superior moral vantage point up there would you care to explain to a stupid fan like me why the fuck i should be expected to honor a set of rules if my opponent decides not to if two people agree to compete under mutual respect for each other and a set of rules and one of them decides to violate that respect why the hell do you think the other person is still bound by it
MMA,not_removed,dont worry he started watching mma at
MMA,not_removed,because martial arts in general is about respect like some were saying during the olympics you can be punished in judo for not shaking handsshowing respect to your opponent after the match that shows how little you really know about not only mma but about being even a mediocrely decent human being i feel genuinely sorry for people that are actually involved in your life if this is how you act towards everything
MMA,not_removed,because thats not allowed and you werent ignorant when you watched your first mma event
MMA,not_removed,okay so youre just going to continue insulting me youre so respectful a true martial artist and are not going to explain why when one competitor disregards that fundamental respect the other is still somehow bound to uphold it neat
MMA,not_removed,nobody is saying youre bound to anything youre more than able to sock your opponent after the bell to end a fight like a childish scumoftheearth being we saw how that worked for daley im not saying josh koscheck is right but daley certainly isnt for conducting himself like that in my mind their both pieces of shit also i never insulted you i do genuinely feel sorry for anyone who is involved with you if this is how you act in person which i know probably isnt since youre talking behind a computer screen
MMA,not_removed,if a behavior is scumoftheearth then you are judging it against some standard by which the person is bound we already said that is mutual respect you have yet to explain why when one person disregards that basis of behavior the other is still required to abide by it if a person walked into a gym and punched a coach in the face and in turn got their ass kicked by students i see nothing wrong with that i would have the same opinion if we were discussing it face to face your passiveaggressive insults about my life martial arts experience social relationships are insults and are very disrespectful as you are aware so now youre being dishonest too
MMA,not_removed,nobody is saying youre bound to anything also your examples are all entirely different hitting an unsuspecting coach is absolutely different than acting to be hit by a knee theres no way you can call daleys despicable behavior as justified whereas attacking someone absolutely justifies an assbeating
MMA,not_removed,you wanna talk
MMA,not_removed,it goes both ways people are making fun of ronda on twitter facebook and unnamed forums
MMA,not_removed,lol this happened on this sub before the fight and still happens now
MMA,not_removed,this is what the ufc asked for thats the fanbase all this bullshit has been targeting ya get what you pay for
MMA,not_removed,if this gets deleted then it gets deleted but i personally think this is something that should be talked about and not drowned out in the megathread
MMA,not_removed,this is good discourse we should have and not be deleted mods stop being dicks some good threads have been flushed down the toilet
MMA,not_removed,well its not really anything that couldnt be in the megathread
MMA,not_removed,yeah memes about her loss not attacking her for her sexual orientation or the way she looks
MMA,not_removed,guess i have to post this in the megathread
MMA,not_removed,right i do understand your point however i can also see why dont you hate facebook fans isnt something that is own post worthy perhaps rufc would be more compromising with what youre looking for
MMA,not_removed,anderson silvaesqe
MMA,not_removed,flairs are up for fight week if you would like a different one then please submit a ms paint picture through modmail of either brockhunt playing poker carlos condit on a dragon brock vs olaf from frozen or rda as frankenstein other ridiculous scenarios will also be accepted yes were serious new
MMA,not_removed,whose names sounds the best when buffer announces them my money is on tj dillashaw
MMA,not_removed,losing to diaz seems to have shaken a lot up in mcgregors camp the fact that hes brought in so many new partners including irelands olympic boxers dillon danis and even specific lanky southpaws to train and spar with after all the talk about how sbg never trains for specific opponents they seem to have made quite a on that but i guess thats what a loss does to you
MMA,not_removed,httpimgurcomqruamrg
MMA,not_removed,what was your worst mma prediction ever i once thought that roger huerta would one day be a ufc hall of famer
MMA,not_removed,what fight are you most looking foward to that has been scheduled my answer is probably the most common but im going to say hunt vs lesnar followed by aldo and edgar heck im looking forward to it all ufc as well because of lawler and then ufc will be a lot of fun as well i love mma what fights that havent been scheduled do you hope they schedule who do you think nick should fight when he finally comes back seems like forever doesnt it hendricks might be fun do you think the bisping and gsp fight is going to happen
MMA,not_removed,anyone else read john kavanaghs book yet i am still only early in it but ive liked it so far great insight on the early days of mma in europe and it so far hasnt talked about conor all that much which i was pleasantly surprised by but i suspect the back half of the book is about conors rise to fame from some extent havent finished it yet but so far i would probably recommend it edit have now read over half interesting insights into conor as a person but definitely hasnt revolved around him still really enjoying it it didnt turn into a conor biography which was my concern before reading it definitely recommend it
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy vs maia who ya got
MMA,not_removed,httpspbstwimgcommediacmnvneowgaashddjpg fair stretch but possible he if hendricks wins he calls him out for rematch
MMA,not_removed,has a fan ever jumped into the octagon before
MMA,not_removed,which titles do you guys think change hands next week
MMA,not_removed,heading out to vegas for ufc and i really need to know if the fan expo is worth going to i imagine a lot of standing in line
MMA,not_removed,has anyone streamed a ufc event on a how was it i dont really want to gamble on it if i can avoid it
MMA,not_removed,how could you bet on dc i cant think of anything he can do to win jones even gus was closer to winning jones than dc in the past
MMA,not_removed,who was renan baroa scheduled to fight when tj stepped in
MMA,not_removed,did someone put up the adult swim animated short yet
MMA,not_removed,who do you think if anyone will crumble by the pressure of ufc who do you think will be pumped up and use the big event to their advantage
MMA,not_removed,im a white boy and im jacked deal with it
MMA,not_removed,so i finally watched the diazgsp fight after putting it off bc nicks my favorite fighter and im a total pussy who didnt feel like watching him get dominated my question is where did the statement come from that nick stuffed of georges takedowns was that an actual statistic because it looked to me like nick stuffed maybe half of gsps takedowns if that was a fun fight to watch though nick had a few good moments and i love him for staying a defiant ass even when hes clearly losing but after watching i have no desire to ever see a rematch i just cant see what nick would have to offer that would change the outcome
MMA,not_removed,does it bother anybody that the rmma warhorse is out for ryan jimmo at the moment considering all anybody did before he died was rip on him for being a roided up boring fighter who talks too much
MMA,not_removed,watching this ufc greatest fighters countdown as they show highlights of the fighter they are talking about ive seen chuck liddell get knocked out about times lol then they cut immediately to chucks thoughts on the fighter which goes a little like hes a great fighter with great heart on all of them lol wth
MMA,not_removed,anyone else think a gsp jacare fight could be a reality the ufc using it as leverage to keep jacare happy i am assuming that the ufc would rather come to a mutual agreement trade off to wait for the title then again the ufc isnt above just telling a fighter fuck you also assuming the ufc really wants this hendo rematch to happen bispings wiki says its scheduled for but who knows if thats true
MMA,not_removed,how do you pronounce usada usada oosahdah
MMA,not_removed,who do you think farts the most out of all the ufc fighters
MMA,not_removed,we will rise conor will rise ireland will rise mark my words we are coming in masses we are coming to show what we are capable of mark my words nate is a lazy and lanky southpaw he will have nothing on conor after his adjustments conor is making at the training camp btw my whole family are coming to see this fight and we will wear green and we will be loud you people dont know shit about the fight game i started bjj because of conor and i am about to receive my blue belt in the autumn that is something isnt it
MMA,not_removed,he kills it on the rowdy ronda rousey
MMA,not_removed,jon bones jones sounds crazy coming from buffer
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,carlos the natural born killer condit if that doesnt give you goose bumps i dont know what to say
MMA,not_removed,joe one bad mofo soto
MMA,not_removed,conors is always really good
MMA,not_removed,tie between dan hardy and frank mir
MMA,not_removed,rousimar palhares
MMA,not_removed,live his guttural rasp anytime he says diaz
MMA,not_removed,nate diazs intro is underrated
MMA,not_removed,win or learn
MMA,not_removed,its actually pretty rare to see i feel so many other fighterscamps blame everything else for losses looking at you sage for a top fighter to acknowledge the problems in his approach and actually do all the things we all accused him of not doing in his previous preparation shows that hes not afraid of facing his shortcomings itll be interesting to see if even all that is enough to beat nate and overcome a tough stylistic matchup
MMA,not_removed,there was some logic to not training for specific opponents since conors had a ton of last minute changes to his fights i think the way theyre handling training now is excellent may be that the whole group is improving now more than ever before i still hope nate wins but i think sbg has shown a huge willingness to learn from their mistakes and its commendable
MMA,not_removed,yep cant believe your own hype that includes a coaching staff ive never been that impressed by sbg conor got his buddies cathal and artem who are nothing more than professional training partners in to the ufc the only other sbg guy worth a damn is gunnar nelson who was actually taught by renzo gracie and john donaher not by kavenaugh
MMA,not_removed,it would want to have shaken them up all of this fighting without style not training specifically for certain opponents that stuff doesnt work against elite fighters so im glad theyve changed their course a bit
MMA,not_removed,this needs to be incorporated to the subreddit somehow
MMA,not_removed,ronda retiring undefeated
MMA,not_removed,when the fight was announced i tweeted numerous times that ronda rousey would finish holly holm under minute and boy was i wrong
MMA,not_removed,the most i ever bet was on tyson griffin to beat gomi heres minute into the first round
MMA,not_removed,ufc i got every single fight wrong except lil nog vs brilz which shoulda been a brilz win
MMA,not_removed,i bet a reddit account with some karma on aldo by submission on the first round against conor had to delete the account now im thinking about doing this again with this new mmaborat account
MMA,not_removed,shogun would light up jones
MMA,not_removed,i thought matyushenko would beat jones
MMA,not_removed,i bet that rashad could beat jones it was more out of spite then a solid prediction but still and then we watched what looked like a year old fighting his dad boy oh boy is jones huge for
MMA,not_removed,brandon vera future ufc champ
MMA,not_removed,hey dude
MMA,not_removed,even though a lot of people hate it im really hyped for mcgregor diaz
MMA,not_removed,joanna vs claudia i finally watched their first fight the other day and it got me incredibly hyped i actually thought claudia won based off how much control she had but she didnt really do much damage joannas footwork and tdd looks like its vastly improved since that fight and ill be interested to see if claudia will be able to hold her against the cage so much this time ill also be interested to see how postusada claudia looks against her i really want to see nick diazgsp perfect fight for both their comebacks bispinggsp would be the biggest fuck you to jacare and i really hope it doesnt happen
MMA,not_removed,alves vs iaquinta one of the toughest fights to call for me big fan of both guys chins will get checked
MMA,not_removed,aldo vs edgar then rda vs alvarez
MMA,not_removed,aldo vs edgar and miesha vs nunes
MMA,not_removed,edit your format bro i think nick diaz should fight gunnar nelson its the fight that makes the most sense i think well really see jacare and romero getting robbed by having henderson fighting bisping
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy and adventures with human backpack i have no clue every time i doubt them they end up proving me wrong i got to go with maia i got maia over condit also
MMA,not_removed,maia by backpack
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy i think his footwork and takedown defense is too good for maia to get him down itd be awesome matchup though
MMA,not_removed,i think cain and dillashaw will win their fights but that event is really relying on two of the four guys not getting too hurt
MMA,not_removed,the closest i can think of is what happened right after the belfort silva fight at ufc brazil you had a bunch of carlsons guys rush the octagon to celebrate the win i know for a fact folks with the ufc nearly shit their pants because they thought this was going to be a pentagon combat situation with the bjj guys squaring off with chute boxe guys
MMA,not_removed,just look at dimebag dont take a chance against fans theyre far more dangerous than the fight itself
MMA,not_removed,lhw maybe sw and i have no idea about wbw honestly i also have aldo for the interim
MMA,not_removed,lhw
MMA,not_removed,intern fwlhw and wbw
MMA,not_removed,sw
MMA,not_removed,i went for ufc for the mcgregor fight and it was a truly amazing experience yes a lot of lines but it was all worth it i met a lot of great fighters both in and out of lines i met robbie lawler just walking in to the mgm the day before for example and had one of the best times of my life
MMA,not_removed,i do it every time its dollars less with the plus club thing and i had a lag only once been using it for all major events for a year or and it quickly adjusted the quality i dont think ill stop using it
MMA,not_removed,dc needs to ragdoll jones uppercut the fuck out of his chin in the clinch and throw a ton of volume thats a lot of things and for all of dcs skills i dont know if he can push that pace for five rounds i guess dc could knock him out but seeing as though jones has never even been knocked down and seeing as though dc has been by someone that theyve both beaten i wouldnt really bet against jones chin a lot of people thought osp was going to catch jones and that didnt really happen jones didnt seem to mind eating osps shots people forget how fantastic jones chin is i have jones by ud in a stinker of a fight
MMA,not_removed,get into close range and box him up before going for a slam jones in the gus fight looked as though boxing was a weak area for him when you get inside his range
MMA,not_removed,theres something called wishful thinking
MMA,not_removed,yep
MMA,not_removed,travis browne has a chance to shock everyone not many people giving him a shot hes got the tools to get it done he needs to come out confident use his range and fire hard body kicks nothing half assed browns tdd is very good for someone his height shows good balance and once he gets inside his elbows are nasty i might put a little on travis if the odds are right havent seen them yet
MMA,not_removed,wutang clan aint nuthing ta fuck wit
MMA,not_removed,nick diaz should fight gunnar nelson
MMA,not_removed,he was boring as fuck but i can still feel bad about what happened not mutually exclusive
MMA,not_removed,yeah chucks been on the receiving end of a handful of good kos there were several clips of him in the ufcs top knockouts
MMA,not_removed,that doesnt make much sense they wouldnt give jacare a fight with gsp to save a potential bispinghendo rematch because gsps return will be much bigger than that his first fight back will be against someone much more profitable than jacare
MMA,not_removed,its an abbreviation so asada but every time i hear it spoken it is pronounced the other way oosahdah sounds so wrong and doesnt even save much time
MMA,not_removed,i say yoosahda lol
MMA,not_removed,meisha its why she always has that look
MMA,not_removed,black beast
MMA,not_removed,big country and johny hendricks could probably melt a few faces
MMA,not_removed,cant tell if this is a joke or not
MMA,not_removed,holy shit boys we have a new copypasta
MMA,not_removed,i hate how he says the natural born killer before he says carlos condit i wish he said it like you wrote it
MMA,not_removed,i loved when hardy would scream englaaaaaand directly in the camera as he was announced gave me the chills everytime and im from texas lol
MMA,not_removed,this is a very solid point i do look for conor to do some things differently this time around but one good camp after complete bullshit camps may not be enough
MMA,not_removed,oh trust me it will be every chance i get for now on lol
MMA,not_removed,judging only by her fights in the ufc it was actually a good prediction in my opinion without taking into account her boxing and preufc fights i think very few people would have guessed she would have any chance against the person who was on a first round finish streak against the top fighters of her division
MMA,not_removed,i bet on lil nog beating rumble
MMA,not_removed,you deserved that gomi is still a legend even if hes declined heavily
MMA,not_removed,man tyson was out he popped up afterward to protest the stoppage but that was ovah
MMA,not_removed,ha i bet a lot of money that john hathaway would beat diego sanchez in that event
MMA,not_removed,watch aldo get kod again
MMA,not_removed,hell i am too even if it is only for the build up the first fight exposed a lot of weaknesses of mcgregor so im curious to see how much he is able to improve his game
MMA,not_removed,just rewatched that fight too joanna fingers were dirty af the whole fight before the accidental headbutt it looks like she was trying to eye gouge so badly claudia had to keep moving her face away from her fingers after the headbutt joanna was fully intentionally trying to jab her fingers right into that cut every time she has the chance you can tell that she clearly have her finger aiming at different targets right after the cut i hope claudia win the rematch
MMA,not_removed,diaz vs gsp the fight itself would be boring the conference calls however
MMA,not_removed,i really want to see nick diazgsp as much as i would hope otherwise it would just be gsp manhandling nick again instead id love to see lawler vs diaz ii both exciting fighters i cant see how it would be anything other than an amazing fight like the first one was
MMA,not_removed,i would read that comic book
MMA,not_removed,agreed wonderboy wont be in front of him to initiate his clinch trips and sloppy shots that said if he can down him he might have his way with steven matt brown dominated him there and we saw his success or lack thereof against maia now i know thompson is better than when he fought matt brown but so is matt brown therefore i still pick wonderboy by ko via straight left round
MMA,not_removed,also went to and i completely agree it was worth to stand and wait in the crowds and lines its pretty cool also got to meet bruceherb and dana after the fight unfortunately only got to see the fighters didnt meet any so imo its still worth it to go but dont be expecting to meet many if any fighters especially since will be more crowded than usual
MMA,not_removed,thanks
MMA,not_removed,no one thought osp would catch jones
MMA,not_removed,interesting thoughts from jj on espn today he says he doesnt respect cormiers wrestling or clinch work and that he has been focusing on takedowns and bjj from the top this camp seems to me its going to be another fight where jones attempts to beat his opponent at his own game and will probably succeed
MMA,not_removed,i agree with the boxing assessment in close quarters jons arms are to long to generate any kind of power and often throws the spinning elbow as a way to damage the opponent and exit the close range and get back to his kickboxing distance
MMA,not_removed,i dont think it would be that shocking of an upset given cains history i think fans appreciate that the wheels can fall off for him anytime
MMA,not_removed,thats a good one would be a huge win by travis hed be up there in title talk again
MMA,not_removed,i actually think travis might take the upset who knows how much longer cain has this in him
MMA,not_removed,i would be so down
MMA,not_removed,its not about feeling bad its the same old back patting shit that always goes on rousey loses gets ripped on rmma pats itself on the back for being above that a few days later same with aldo same with kimbo same with mcgregor its all self congratulation
MMA,not_removed,true its hard to sell jacare fighting gsp to the masses the most profitable option is a title fight
MMA,not_removed,chael sonnen keeps saying oosahdah and i think it stuck with me
MMA,not_removed,i love carne asada this makes me hungry
MMA,not_removed,wow yeah i think this is the best
MMA,not_removed,maybe its bryan then
MMA,not_removed,you people dont know shit about the fight game i started bjj because of conor and i am about to receive my blue belt in the autumn that is something isnt it gotta be a joke
MMA,not_removed,yikes man any reason why i mean hindsight is but i remember when they scheduled that fight i thought for sure it was gonna be a murder
MMA,not_removed,nice man thats a solid gambling win
MMA,not_removed,there is a lot to work on but the energy thing is definitely a big issue you can tell throughout the first round that he was putting way to much into his punches back foot was coming off the ground a lot and all the spinning heel kicksside kicks take a lot of energy but one thing chael said that i found interesting was that if he got tired in one round then there is no way he can turn minutes of energy into minutes unless you do less output and conor is a high output guy
MMA,not_removed,theres too many other matchups for lawler to justify diaz getting a shot anytime soon i feel like gsp diaz would be interesting to see if gsp still has the explosiveness and strength to take and keep nick down nick looks bigger these days and gsp said recently that hes walking around at about pounds itd be a good test for both and the buildup and hype would be amazing its the big money fight that both of them want
MMA,not_removed,really
MMA,not_removed,that sucks
MMA,not_removed,how did you meet danaetc after the fight
MMA,not_removed,osp hit him like twice and didnt even rock him really not that big of a deal
MMA,not_removed,osp hit him like twice and didnt even rock him really not that big of a deal
MMA,not_removed,i guess not the odds are only around for browne and for cain i thought it would be higher around i just havent heard anymany people say they were picking browne to win i wouldnt touch it at current odds but still think travis has a good chance
MMA,not_removed,yup thats how online forums are
MMA,not_removed,based on his statements post healy situation im pretty sure caraway keeps
MMA,not_removed,well i thought rumble had the power advantage duh but figured nog was the more technical boxer and thought maybe he could avoid the big shots and outpoint him in a decision and if it somehow went to the ground nog could have definitely got a sub seconds in i realized that was all wishful thinking lol
MMA,not_removed,i feel like good cardio is a must at this level of competition
MMA,not_removed,agreed i honestly thought he was gassing against mendes when i watched it live mendes just faded a little more
MMA,not_removed,its just a wasted matchup for me so many other possibilities for both id rather not see gsp do a rematch either â hes got nothing to prove fighting diaz he beat him soundly already if there was any rematch for him id prefer it against hendricks as hendricks arguably won in many peoples eyes gsp against any of the other ww contenders or even lawler would be much better than a rematch with diaz
MMA,not_removed,i was sitting fairly close to the cage and dana started arguing with some fighter about a stoppage so when he was done talking i walked through some chairs and security and asked if i could get a picture with him same thing with bruce met him before the main event and i met herb after the main event when everyone was leaving it was unfortunate since i could see frankie and tj from where i was sitting but didnt get the opportunity to go see them only got to meet hughes which was still pretty cool
MMA,not_removed,agree with you that brown has a good chance i think people are not picking him to win because they want him to lose his last performance did the mans public image no favors
MMA,not_removed,i think a bit of self awareness might go a long way if thats the case
MMA,not_removed,definitely you can get away with quick kos and firstsecond round finishes but at some point you will probably face a guyguys who can take your shots and if you have bad cardio or are not efficient then rip
MMA,not_removed,i dont know if gsp wants to make a run at the title in his comeback all his talk is about fights against everybody but actual ww contenders of course gsplawler would be amazing but gsp doesnt seem to be talking much about it i wonder if rory signs with another organisation if gsp will go for the ww title without any guilt id love to see gsp get the belt back though if he was to go for the belt and fight contenders he should get a straight shot at lawler given he retired with the belt
MMA,not_removed,remindme days
MMA,not_removed,wellyou told me to hold you too it
MMA,not_removed,oh you mustve had amazing seats then
MMA,not_removed,that fight shouldve been stopped totally ridiculous that it was allowed to go on
MMA,not_removed,esp for five round fights and have either of the diaz brothers ever been kod cant remember they have steel chins
MMA,not_removed,yeah for sure i think the best thing he should do is go straight for the belt against lawler or whoever is champ if not maybe he could have a tune up fight and then if he loses and he keeps fighting just do interesting matchups
MMA,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of days to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
MMA,not_removed,yea my dad paid a lot for tickets luckily the company he works for had sent him out to nevada for business during the week of the fight so the plane ticket and hotel was covered
MMA,not_removed,how do you think he would fare against lawler assuming hes roughly the same fighter he was when he left personally i cant see anyone outside of lawler and wonderboy beating him
MMA,not_removed,when i want pics damnit
MMA,not_removed,very nice
MMA,not_removed,lawler has good td defense so if gsp couldnt get him down the striking battle would be interesting i still think gsp would win unless hes declined since retiring
MMA,not_removed,remindme weeks
MMA,not_removed,get it on your ankle foot or toe then
MMA,not_removed,strange that the ops account doesnt exist if you click it selfpromotion without contributing is not cool man
MMA,not_removed,nunes looks like tyson they really fucked up with that pic
MMA,not_removed,they both use the words back
MMA,not_removed,huh
MMA,not_removed,damn right shes the mike tyson of mma
MMA,not_removed,im seriously surprised ufc didnt make an attempt to market this as the beauty vs the beast
MMA,not_removed,also face
MMA,not_removed,considering this was after his state sponsored leave is there something about ronda they arent telling us
MMA,not_removed,i feel like he was born in the wrong generation the would have loved this dude
MMA,not_removed,we dont deserve this kid
MMA,not_removed,heck yeah
MMA,not_removed,its more impressive that danny hodge can still do it with one hand
MMA,not_removed,thats fucking hilarious i wonder does he get why everyone laughs so much around him and hes just playing it up for the boost in ratings and moolah
MMA,not_removed,i was gonna say it isnt that difficult but holy shit he did that with such ease
MMA,not_removed,i would love to see apple ripping become a trend among ufc fighters supersage
MMA,not_removed,i was expecting him to use some form of technique like the other people who ive seen tear apples in two but the kid just rips it apart pretty impressive really
MMA,not_removed,bob mortimar mid did this on
MMA,not_removed,holy fucking grip strength batman
MMA,not_removed,made that look way too easy
MMA,not_removed,bob sapp did this eons ago step up your game sage
MMA,not_removed,i mean whats next he gonna squish a banana in his ass cheeks this dude is a human labradoodle
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck lol is he even going to eat it
MMA,not_removed,this is the kind of news rmma and i need thanks uthetruthjackson
MMA,not_removed,ok hitler i see you
MMA,not_removed,i mean this literally looks and sounds like an advert not natural behavior haha
MMA,not_removed,i wish he would do that do my scrotum
MMA,not_removed,i am so glad that he exists in our world
MMA,not_removed,i tried this its more difficult than it looks and i can crush a walnut with one hand
MMA,not_removed,i dont know what it is but something about his face just makes it seem extremely punchable seems like he has made a good career choice
MMA,not_removed,why is he soo ugh
MMA,not_removed,not that impressive when bob mortimer can do it although tbf sage doesnt use his techique he just rips it in half from top to bottom
MMA,not_removed,the too
MMA,not_removed,i love him today i will marry him and im not even gay yet
MMA,not_removed,i still cant get over the fact that he is a real person
MMA,not_removed,yes sir
MMA,not_removed,hahaha came here to say that heck yeah
MMA,not_removed,jesus fucking christ
MMA,not_removed,i think sage knows why everyones laughing and hes playing it up a little hes a smart kid theres no way hes not selfaware
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i was gonna say it isnt that difficult but holy poop he did that with such ease
MMA,not_removed,username checks out xd
MMA,not_removed,ive always been taught to just shove through the top of the core to split it vertically its way easier this was beast tho lol
MMA,not_removed,not quite he used a trick to split it vertically at its point of weakness sage just destroyed his lol
MMA,not_removed,so it is pretty impressive
MMA,not_removed,is there a generation that wouldnÂ´t have loved him
MMA,not_removed,excellent
MMA,not_removed,is he though
MMA,not_removed,it doesnt look like anything to me
MMA,not_removed,old man strength is real bruh
MMA,not_removed,hes actually using a cool trick pull the stem out then shove a finger into the top of the apple core it will split evenly pretty much every time and is about easier than the way sage did it
MMA,not_removed,depends which one takes more strength
MMA,not_removed,this one
MMA,not_removed,thats up for debate
MMA,not_removed,i see you
MMA,not_removed,but we do
MMA,not_removed,is it though
MMA,not_removed,nice try schaub
MMA,not_removed,as if having a short conversation would mean you know the real them ill never understand posts like this like people saying they met someone like tony ferguson and had a minute conversation he seems like a great guy all the hate is nonsense etc why would you think you know them enough to say dont judge a book by its cover from having a minute conversation
MMA,not_removed,well you cant possibly know their true characters from one encounter i imagine that theyre both decent human beings like the rest of us though
MMA,not_removed,let me rephrase what i said nobody thinks brendan schaub is a bad person we just think hes a person of conviction fake as hell and a dbag he talks shit on people who play videogames post on forums and likes dragonsfantasy but the dude dyes his hair silver and cares more about pop culture and fashion then percent of gay dudes or females the podcast has also went down the shitter to something they use to sell tshirts and make money off ads show used to be great but schaub is unbearable nowhes not bad on fight compansions though but his podcast just makes you extra stupid i wish no harm on brendan but he needs to stop backtracking everything he says i just felt the need to say that since people keep randomly defending him on here like we think hes some evil person
MMA,not_removed,i hope we get weekly posts now of people meeting these two and then going all im gonna say is that they were pretty chill hey guys they were pretty chill no i dont care the truth is i never cared regardless the people that do care so much are the ones that stalk the shit out of them and act crazy as fuck dont worry about them they suck
MMA,not_removed,people who hate schaub as a person are retarded because they have never met himhad an extended conversation people who think schaub is a shit fightfighter analyst and has never said anything substantive are and fersure justified
MMA,not_removed,yeah because people dont try to leave a good first impression to strangers i guess i expected him to wedgie strangers and rip on them thanks for proving hes a great dude
MMA,not_removed,i dont even care about the two of them i just find it funny how everyones arguing about it and saying that op has no way of knowing theyre chill when they havent even spoken to either of them for those minutes its not as if those who are claiming hes universally a dickhead spoke to him either so
MMA,not_removed,i dont think anyone considers shaub to be a sociopath seriously its not that hard to be nice to a random person in a short time interval especially if they tell you that theyre a fan
MMA,not_removed,but did he talk about his work ethic
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,sperm diet
MMA,not_removed,you caught me
MMA,not_removed,its a hey look at me post
MMA,not_removed,as opposed to judging people from clickbait titles and lowlight videos
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,so everyone calls him a douche on here without ever looking him eye to eye and shaking his hand right
MMA,not_removed,so youre judging him about what he does online and without ever meeting him in person once you are face to face and shake his hand youd think otherwise
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about
MMA,not_removed,its silly lots of goofs
MMA,not_removed,ya i dont give a fuck theyre all on steroids
MMA,not_removed,youd be surprised
MMA,not_removed,nope he asked how i was liking the job
MMA,not_removed,ya not really but thanks for the input
MMA,not_removed,totallynotatroll btw did you just hit firaz up recently re huntlesnar i remember it being a decent question but youre off base here my man anyone who actually watches watched tfatk sees brendan has really and truly become a bit of an asswipe but the guys in his mid hes excited his world is different to what he would have imagined and for someone like that he has done a decent job of staying appreciative to the people who got him there even if he is convinced that main person is himself lol i dont know him but my instinct is he would be a decent dude if you ran into him in the street and needed help thats good enough for me
MMA,not_removed,yep you can really judge character through the computer so fucking stupid
MMA,not_removed,his podcast is a memorandum of thousands of hours of his dialogues and thoughts a persons personality and character shines through after so much talk unless brendan schaub is indeed sociopathic meanwhile you are trying to convince people that you can judge someones character after a short facetoface conversation no doubt governed by things such as social etiquette which only help obscure peoples nature
MMA,not_removed,shush dingus
MMA,not_removed,i was going to say my judgements are based off the only way he promotes himself the podcast thats the only way we can judge himim pretty sure i would get along with him in real lifewe both play sports me basketball though and there are a few other things we both did that i dont talk about on here cause nobody would believe me anyway im sure i would like him in person but his opinions fucking suck on his podcast i even bought one of his god dam shirtsi was a fan but hes said so many things and back tracked on so much that i cant respect him anymore silver hair
MMA,not_removed,u assho hitmeup
MMA,not_removed,maybe just maybe hes acting on the show i know it might be hard for your brain to comprehend but in order to generate views people act crazy and say crazy shit online are you really saying you can judge someone by staring at them on a podcast with no interactions sad
MMA,not_removed,youre on steroids
MMA,not_removed,his hair was normal today and he didnt act at all like the podcast its a fucking act man i mean he asked me how the job was going and shit
MMA,not_removed,lucky guess edit i actually am no idea how this dingbat and his crystal ball caught that tho lol
MMA,not_removed,i dont doubt iti always liked schaub until recently its just clear to me now when he talkshe thinks what he can say that people will like him the most like i liked him more when he said stupid shit and stood by it now you can tell hes hearing bad feedback and he just wants to be liked so bad the dude just had a kid and hes buying a bentley brendan just trys so hard
MMA,not_removed,because hes in hollywood man the show is an act when hes on camera its an act this is what people do the stupid shit he says generates talk and more views
MMA,not_removed,you lose the right to a tribute after your boss sees you running naked down a hallway at work
MMA,not_removed,hes not a friend he was never danas friend
MMA,not_removed,cant believe that goldie imma miss you
MMA,not_removed,i was thinking i must of missed his send off video it sucks he didnt get one ive been a critic of him and im eager to see someone else in there but still he should of gotten some type of goodbye
MMA,not_removed,yeah what the hell i was waiting for something but he must have been under instruction to say nothing all he got was to squeeze in a brief thank you to a few people right at the end heard his voice crack a little poor guy fuck you new owners that is so wrong see ya goldie everyone will miss you
MMA,not_removed,i actually think thats how i got my raise or at least im sure that raised something of my boss
MMA,not_removed,this is repost i am a repost life is a repost
MMA,not_removed,why repost something that is literally still on the front page
MMA,not_removed,it has points dont pretend you didnt see it
MMA,not_removed,repost has achieved singularity
MMA,not_removed,aldo vs conor vs mayweather triple threat boxing match
MMA,not_removed,how well would aldo get paid in boxing obviously he wont be a contender just wonder if hell get paid better
MMA,not_removed,nate and jose be like
MMA,not_removed,why does a quarter of the roster now want to switch to boxing its like with toney except in reverse and everyone wants to switch from mma
MMA,not_removed,something is not adding up here from this interview with aldo and his coach i think hes afraid of this fight more than anything â except fighting aldo again because relinquishing a belt to avoid a rematch i dont think you can be more afraid than that from conors interview the other night conorif they came to me and asked hey conor i know you have this baby coming but if you want to fight for this featherweight belt in march i would have went in and slept holloway or aldo or whoever they wanted no problem all they had to do was ask instead they created an interim belt they gave back the unified belt to a guy i kod in seconds aldo the guy i dominated is now the interim title holder holloway look i was almost embarrassed for them i was embarrassed for the way it was playing out is that really how bad its gone you have create all this fake stuff to sell some stuff but it still sold shit it still sold nothing ariel interjects they never asked conor wha i think hes had a few beers btw ariel they never asked for your permission conor before there were conversations not after after they just went silent and then it just happened something is up here conor is saying that after winning the belt dana or the ufc made no offer to defend his title before deciding to strip him aldo and his team are saying that conor wasnt willing to fight them since i dont believe either are liars is it possible that the ufc were never going to let conor have two belts for an extended period of time considering the power it gives him in terms of marketing drawing power
MMA,not_removed,can we stop just go kick the fuck out of holloway and then do the same to tony or khabib stop trying to chase conor everywhere looking to get his attention towards you go beat the fuck out of some people and make sure youre the only person worth fighting
MMA,not_removed,the man who has no real punching kos in the ufc wants to box sounds good
MMA,not_removed,of course he is
MMA,not_removed,just waiting for wme ufc to open up a new boxing promotion
MMA,not_removed,called
MMA,not_removed,now im starting to believe that guy that said they are getting boxing licenses to push the ali act
MMA,not_removed,aldo has a history of retracting whatever he says in interviews so disregard this just like you should have disregarded his talk of retirement or supporting a fighters union
MMA,not_removed,lol conor goes and gets a boxing license diaz i wanna fuckin box too aldo i want to box too
MMA,not_removed,first nate now aldo lol
MMA,not_removed,for sure dont do that my man
MMA,not_removed,i feel like as soon as one of these guys actually has an actual boxing match this insanity will stop
MMA,not_removed,holy shit aldo really wanna fight conor no matter weight or sport
MMA,not_removed,has fantastic jiu jitsu amazing takedown defense killer knees and leg kicks from hell wants to box i know he has good hands but damn what a waste that would be
MMA,not_removed,aldos kicks are his biggest weapons not sure why hed go into boxing if anything its the one aspect of his game he needs to train
MMA,not_removed,aldo is trying so hard to stay relevant
MMA,not_removed,aldos trying to think outside the box how bout dat
MMA,not_removed,would be a mistake kicking and tdd are some of his greatest strengths and he wouldnt be able to utilise these at all also you have to wonder about how much the conor ko took out of his chin too getting smashed like that isnt exactly great for the long term structural integrity of the mandible
MMA,not_removed,aldos going to chase conor all over the world and challenge him at everything he possibly can
MMA,not_removed,more and more people are going to try and protect themselves with the ali act by getting that boxing ticket
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,conor forever hunted by the ghosts of his vanquished enemies
MMA,not_removed,god shut it already
MMA,not_removed,lol this is why he lost to conor his boxing skills suck
MMA,not_removed,and the referee brock refnar
MMA,not_removed,make nate doing a surprise entrance with a steelchair after they think they are done
MMA,not_removed,conor pacquiao vs aldo floyd tag team until one man is left standing
MMA,not_removed,by gawd here comes diaz with a chair
MMA,not_removed,with nate and tony to face the winner in another triple threat boxing match at wrestlemania
MMA,not_removed,ebi rules but open handed chair shots from the ground are allowed
MMA,not_removed,mayweather would realistically win this
MMA,not_removed,only for a few seconds though than it would be just conor and floyd
MMA,not_removed,can you imagine main event mayweather vs mcgregor and comain aldo vs pacquiao probably the only thing that would ever get me to buy a boxing ppv
MMA,not_removed,well youre from brazil so you tell us how would that work
MMA,not_removed,there is no ufc like league in boxing and in order to earn money a boxer has to work his way into becoming a draw or make regular appearances on televised cards aldo is not gonna be able to this in america the easiest way for him to make money is start his own promotion fight cans in brazil and take all the profits from ticket sales and sponsors do you think aldo can fill a local arena for a fight against some no name boxer
MMA,not_removed,boxing in north america is mostly limited to shrinking hboshowtime budgets if you are one of the chosen few with them it can be quite lucrative not so much without them though unless you get whatever is left of the waddell reed war chest
MMA,not_removed,it depends on a lot of things in the usa the market for boxing is federally regulated to the extent that the headlining fighter can take the bulk of the revenue if they set the contracts up to that end if he fights in brazil he might fill an arena but he might have to deal with a shady promoter if he fought in the us he could make money if he sells tickets
MMA,not_removed,if there was a jose aldo vs amir khan or something like that he could easily make aldo a few million boxers also tend to have much more control and negotiating power over the structure of the deal the ufc paid aldo for each of his last two fights one was vs conor mcgregor and one was vs frankie edgar
MMA,not_removed,grass is always greener
MMA,not_removed,more money and more control
MMA,not_removed,i dont think hes serious i think aldo is just frustrated and close to being done fighting for the ufc
MMA,not_removed,this isnt new anderson silva wanted to do it since forever he kept talking about fighting rjj mma fighters want to be boxers and boxers want to be mma fighters its the same way basketball players making million a year talk about playing football
MMA,not_removed,boxing pays a lot better a lot
MMA,not_removed,cos conor
MMA,not_removed,lot of answers none really pointing to what i think is the most obvious reason ali act
MMA,not_removed,bruce lee got a inch punch i gotta inch punch
MMA,not_removed,its an angle fighters are debating trying to exploit as a loophole if they go box they become a licensed boxer covered under the boxing reform the muhammad ali act this would give them rights covered by federal law regardless of which sport they participate in this is a possible out for the exclusive lock down contracts the ufc forces fighters to sign if they want onboard they give away all their rights licensing etc conor pretty much started it and now were seeing others slowly follow we just have to see someone actually take the plunge and then see what happens in court if conrs recent tweets are anything to go by it might be happening really soon
MMA,not_removed,does everyone also think they can easily perform at a high level in boxing
MMA,not_removed,to put it simply because conor really put the idea in their heads
MMA,not_removed,something is up here dana
MMA,not_removed,is it possible that the ufc were never going to let conor have two belts for an extended period of time yes because the ufc needs the belts involved in headlining events to make the events more marketable the truth is that ufc events sell pretty poorly outside of ones that are propped up by conor other stars are finished or at their end rousey gsp jones
MMA,not_removed,you mean like the times between and where dana said conor will defend his belt and somehow he never defended his belt its not a shock then that dana assumed he wouldnt defend is it conorman says a lot of things
MMA,not_removed,conor went months without defending and then immediately said publicly he was taking time off maybe the ufc could have asked him to fight but at the same time if someone says theyre taking time off why should the ufc assume thats not true and offer fights anyway in reality it was probably a negotiating tactic for conor and the ufc didnt want to negotiate any further
MMA,not_removed,you have create all this fake stuff to sell some stuff quite ironic cause thats conor in a nutshell
MMA,not_removed,lmfao ofc conor is lying through his teeth
MMA,not_removed,dont need to be a ko artist in either sport to be well andre ward and mayweather both dont tko many people but win often and convincingly minus the kovalev fight aldo has great head movement and boxing in mma i think hed fair alright
MMA,not_removed,now thats an interesting thought
MMA,not_removed,but conorfloyd is a great idea
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,if he was even good enough to play as a pro in brazil he would have never stepped into mma i would imagine
MMA,not_removed,bro
MMA,not_removed,get out you know nothing
MMA,not_removed,and hornswoggle punching them in the nuts from behind
MMA,not_removed,cecil peoples as one of the judges
MMA,not_removed,and a water bottle throwing tournament to cap the evening
MMA,not_removed,im imagining it as watching two top tier mma fighters get picked apart until losing a decision and knocked the fuck out in that order id buy it
MMA,not_removed,i dont no anything about boxing tho in bjj i have too pay too compete so i dont know much about making money
MMA,not_removed,considering how dead boxing is here i would be surprised if he got even one tenth of what he is making on the ufc aldo would likely do it for fun not profit if he could fight the southamerican circuit he might make something worth writing about but even then i doubt it would be much
MMA,not_removed,if he fought in the us he could make money if he sells tickets seems very unlikely as he couldnt even sell tickets for his mma fights even though he was one of the most dominant fighters out there
MMA,not_removed,this time it is boxing money is spectacular if youre a big star mma money is shit also better contracts thanks to the ali act
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure i saw an interview prior to the mcgregor fight where aldo said in years youll see me in a professional boxing ring iirc
MMA,not_removed,i imagine that its one of his passions he has said the same thing about football and footvolley i dont think it has to do with him being frustrated just about him wanting to move on to his next passion in life
MMA,not_removed,i know anderson expressed about fighting rjj but its not as if everyone else wanted to do it too
MMA,not_removed,what high level boxers have ever said they wanna be mma fighters
MMA,not_removed,the same reason mj randomly quit the nba to play in the minor leagues of baseball
MMA,not_removed,thats a common misconception big boxing draws get paid better than big mma draws but the difference in pay for low to mid level popular fighters is a lot smaller than its made out to be
MMA,not_removed,dontbelievehisliesjpg
MMA,not_removed,dana is a liar butare we going to pretend that conor showed much interest in defending that belt at any point between to when he was stripped come on man
MMA,not_removed,everything aldo is doing is to chase conor conor goes to weeks later aldo says i might take a run at conor gets a boxing licence weeks later aldo says i might try and get into boxing im not saying aldo owes me anything personally i dont care if aldo ever fights again but this chasing conor stuff has got to stop
MMA,not_removed,his kicks were what made him so lethal even when he didnt throw them you have to respect the possibility i dont think his skill set is one for boxing his hands are great but his style is hugely tied to other mma aspects
MMA,not_removed,tirteen seconds
MMA,not_removed,because you can be submitted in boxing
MMA,not_removed,aldo and mcgregor vs mayweather handicap
MMA,not_removed,more drain bamage
MMA,not_removed,boxing gloves protect your hands not the opponents head
MMA,not_removed,theres always money in the burger stand
MMA,not_removed,yeah the only time he broke was against conor iirc he averages around on ppvs he headlines
MMA,not_removed,seems very unlikely as he couldnt even sell tickets for his mma fights he couldnt sell ppvs but was the audience not filled out
MMA,not_removed,big boxing money is rarer than boxing pundits let on if youre not a a welterweight b puerto ricanmexican or c a ridiculous personality it is tough if not impossible to reach that level also the ali act has done nothing for boxing despite good intentions you need only to look at andre wards protracted legal dispute and how the ali act was so ineffectual that it cost him years of his prime to resolve the situation with gossen
MMA,not_removed,yeah youre right but its only aldo and mcgregor right now too
MMA,not_removed,nick diaz wanted to and almost did iirc
MMA,not_removed,amir khan for one
MMA,not_removed,i think the fights that these mma fighters would get would be popular enough that the difference would be large
MMA,not_removed,this sub can be pretty ridiculous with this shit conor had zero interest in defending the title he got the exact fights he wanted
MMA,not_removed,everything aldo is doing is to chase conor well in the last weeks aldo went to the finals of a footvolley tournament aired by the tv network in brazil played soccer in a charity event along with celebrities politicians and expro soccer players before brazil x colombia match announced he is franchising his burger joint to expand it in brazil started working in a charity soccer match with antonio pizzonia exformula one all that while training and promoting his movietv series i think aldo is way busier than the average mma fighter for someone to say he is doing nothing but chasing conor regarding the boxing talk he mentioned interest in doing other sports back when he was talking about retirement before his meeting with dana sure any fighter can say this kind of thing just to get attention but he has actual involvement with sports bjj in past competitions mma and now with soccer and footvolley so i think his boxing intentions deserve more credit than its all because of conor
MMA,not_removed,every fighter chases guys they lose against even conor only difference is the ufc bent over backwards to give him his rematch so he didnt have to chase as desperately
MMA,not_removed,well thats not whats happening so lucky for you it stopped
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,not as much as youd think
MMA,not_removed,it depends how much the tickets are selling for baseball games get decent attendance because you can get some nice seats for around i remember when kobe was tearing it up on the lakers couldnt even get you a nosebleed seat
MMA,not_removed,i just picked a random recent ppv which shows that lemieux and tapia are making as non championship undercard fights the money is still there
MMA,not_removed,nate has applied for a boxing license as well and has talked about it
MMA,not_removed,i think its best to exclude the diaz brothers though considering their heavily boxing orientated fight mentality the diaz brothers just want to swing but theyre dangerous as fuck on the ground too
MMA,not_removed,isnt he actually considering it
MMA,not_removed,i think that is highly highly unlikely boxing is a far bigger sport with more competing athletes aldo is already a notably unpopular champion who is not from one of the boxingheavy latin america countries that come out in droves to support their boxers add that to the fact that aldo would be in boxings welterweight division the single deepest division in the sport with more stars and box office dynamos than most divisions combined aldo would never get the same exposure as he gets as ufc featherweight champion
MMA,not_removed,maybe their first fight when they get abused andor knocked out by a more skilled boxer unless they get booked against an amateur boxer at which point theres not much of a draw if youre already a huge star take cm punk and you switch sports you can bring a lot of interest just because you have a huge following but aldo was champ for how many years and still isnt a huge draw in mma i just dont see it happening the only exception would be mcgregor right now although if and when he actually gets a boxing match and gets destroyed i doubt he gets another i think his goal is to make his money and gtfo and he doesnt really care if he gets owned in the ring i think most people would fight mayweather for million
MMA,not_removed,pretty sure he wanted rda at and aldo at
MMA,not_removed,its the acai stand thats rakin in all the doe
MMA,not_removed,thats not spectacular money compared to similar situations in the ufc lemieux is the former ibf milddleweight world champion dillashaw recently got paid the same amount for a nonchampionship undercard fight
MMA,not_removed,yeah but nate has talked about that even when anderson was talking about it
MMA,not_removed,i appreciate your perspective youre probably right it just seems really big to me right now
MMA,not_removed,and then he fought someone else and got the fight he wanted after come on lets not play spin doctor he didnt intend on defending the belt
MMA,not_removed,never said he did he planned on beating aldo and moving up to and he said this at the go big ufc press conference in
MMA,not_removed,so we agree he never planned on defending his title
MMA,not_removed,cuz ronda reacted very badly to her first loss she was thinking of killing herself and people thought she wouldnt return then she decides to return and gives a very embarrassing performance
MMA,not_removed,prior to this fight when she lost to holly holm she spiraled into depression talked about killing herself talked about settling down and having babies but then this was her big comeback over a year later and then she gets smoked in under a minute her hype is gone her fire to fight is probably gone
MMA,not_removed,deleted in
MMA,not_removed,because she made her career on being a warrior princess shes been battered in her last two fights
MMA,not_removed,edmud
MMA,not_removed,this is just a guy looking for karma
MMA,not_removed,she had a year out after a devastating loss only to come back to another devastating loss
MMA,not_removed,deleted
MMA,not_removed,the previous time she lost she had a mental breakdown this loss was much more embarassing
MMA,not_removed,well shes lost by ko twice in a row her invincibility aura is gone her striking is shit and unless she switches gyms it wont change also she was suicidal with her previous loss and now is probably even more so after losses in a row
MMA,not_removed,because she is one of the worst strikers ever despite being an elite olympic athlete in terms of physicality and technical skill
MMA,not_removed,i think most people think this because of the way she handled her last loss to holly holm she went into a depression and didnt ever really seem like she cared as much anymore leading up to this fight and she got smoked she already has one foot out the door with movies and stuff
MMA,not_removed,she didnt get her belt back and got exposed as having terrible standup again she would have to fight her way through some contenders for a pay cut and she will not do that she probably wouldnt be able to win back the belt ever the division has passed her by
MMA,not_removed,it was her come back fight after taking a year off from her last fight she dominated a washed females devision and has competition that is way better then her now she said her first loss had her thinking of suicide a few months ago she did an interview on ellen saying she wasnt fighting much longer
MMA,not_removed,rhonda did not just lose she was demolished it was quite frankly embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,she got head kick kod in her last fight and then took a year off to recove healthy anyways after that trauma in this time through media appearances it was apparent the loss had psychologically crushed her to the point of suicidal thoughtsurges after another decisive and destructive loss like this many mma fans assume that this is the straw that broke the camels back and that she is now going to be done with fighting
MMA,not_removed,post this question in the general discussion or moronic monday
MMA,not_removed,thank you for the answer
MMA,not_removed,well its okay there are some good answers here thank you all
MMA,not_removed,that and if she wasnt mentally broken before she is now two brutal losses in a row
MMA,not_removed,naw just wanted to know also it got deleted already so no worries about that
MMA,not_removed,this fight still doesnt make any sense but i fully expect swanson to put it on him
MMA,not_removed,lobov via comeback in the round with a double standing hammerfist to stun cub finishing with a darce
MMA,not_removed,this surely means that maia and masvidal cant be on this card no way they make in a round fight that isnt on a ppv card maia vs masvidal is a headliner in and of itself and a bigger fight than swanson vs lobov
MMA,not_removed,can you imagine a world where artem wins and is ranked top
MMA,not_removed,ufc desperate for a conor appearance i guess
MMA,not_removed,so maia vs masvidal is rounds because this meme fight apparently needs to be wtf
MMA,not_removed,so the ufc is pretty much the wwe with real fights now right
MMA,not_removed,really hope swanson doesnt underestimate him and get caught hope he still brings his a game and puts on a masterpiece
MMA,not_removed,id love to see cub get the gold strap before retiring ive been a big fan of his since the wec days
MMA,not_removed,this is cubs best chance to get a fight against conor beat up artem viciously then taunt conor
MMA,not_removed,i hope swanson keeps this haircut looks rad
MMA,not_removed,i know this fight doesnt make a ton of sense but im super hyped for it even if artem gets outclassed you know hes going to bring the fight and cub well he always is creative and exciting im happy for artem hes a guy with a record but he doesnt quit and has taken advantage of a the opportunities given to him even though hes basically where he is because hes buddies with conor
MMA,not_removed,danahe is still my boy
MMA,not_removed,swanson is apparently training with dora and ryan hall human backpack inc
MMA,not_removed,damn that tweet was spicy
MMA,not_removed,does that mean maia vs masvidal isnt happening
MMA,not_removed,im glad for cub hes got his main event but this is still an odd fight as far as im concerned
MMA,not_removed,anyone think artem is going to get killed i was not impressed with his recent fight and cub obviously looked great and motivated
MMA,not_removed,why in the fuck is cub vs a regional fighter main event over a probable contender fight between masdival and maia
MMA,not_removed,i truly believe this would be the biggest upset ever serra wasnt great and gsp was awesome but this a top fighter vs a dude who kinda sucks
MMA,not_removed,artem by first round ko
MMA,not_removed,i really dont see artem winning this lol
MMA,not_removed,were being robbed if masvidal vs maia is rounds
MMA,not_removed,i still think this is a pointless fight for cub he let himself be goaded into it by artems taunting
MMA,not_removed,hah would be a pretty bad look for cub to go the full with artem no
MMA,not_removed,so maia vs masvidal to essentially determine a ww contender is comain event to a battle between and fws makes perfect sense book it dana
MMA,not_removed,the only hope i give artem is sbg if sbg can put him together a game plan and artem can stick to it hes got it there is so much footage of cub fighting you can get a very good idea of what cub is capable of with artem you may have some footage but its raw unrefined artem artem is still changing and growing i imagine it would be hard to pin down a pattern or habits
MMA,not_removed,good for him i think ufc is trying to build him show him starching artem in brutal fashion and keep putting him in barnburners
MMA,not_removed,artem memed himself to a god damn main event vs a top contender very curious to see if he can even compete
MMA,not_removed,maybe cub is going the wwe route where he brutalizes conors friend to try to shittalk himself into a conor grudge match hell if artem can meme his way into a contender fight maybe cub can talk his way into a money match i wouldnt mind cub deserves to make some money and him vs conor would be fireworks
MMA,not_removed,the thinking is that after the choi fight cub can be a draw hence give him a fight like this so he can obtain some insane flashy highlight reel footage
MMA,not_removed,yeah i cant see any scenario where its competetive people talk about artems striking like its good for ufc level but its absolutely not and even on the regional circuit against low level guys hes never shown punch power just a bizarre and hilarious mismatch
MMA,not_removed,lol relax this aint remembers hendricks made weight remembers gsp actually returning remembers conorfloyd might actually fucking happen fuckingwhyman hmmmmm nvm might be full of surprises too
MMA,not_removed,can those stubby arms even pull off a darce
MMA,not_removed,standing reverse darce by god
MMA,not_removed,youre crazy i really like cub the way he fights reminds me of part cobra part kangaroo
MMA,not_removed,im still concinved the ufc put the maiamasvidal fight out there to try and pressure maia hopefully he holds his ground and waits
MMA,not_removed,if that fight happens im buying tickets im only two hours away and went to the last nashville card but it wasnt very exciting pretty good fights but the crowd just sucked
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,thats basically what just happened with randa markos not too long ago she was finished in the first round by casey and unranked with a split decision win over esparza shes in the top again
MMA,not_removed,if artem somehow wins then i hope they do choiartem
MMA,not_removed,ufc lobov v diaz
MMA,not_removed,he wont be there
MMA,not_removed,or maiamasvidal isnt happening at all
MMA,not_removed,maia subs him within imo no need for rounds
MMA,not_removed,was since brock got the title shot
MMA,not_removed,first your son now your dear ol dad is going to get it if the pussy takes the fight
MMA,not_removed,best chance but still close to none
MMA,not_removed,even though hes basically where he is because hes buddies with conor you say that but plenty of tuf losers have been given a shot in the ufc and after losing the finale hes gone i fully expect that to turn into but hes proven he belongs there by beating a major up and comer in ishihara ishihara was getting a ton of praise until artem beat him his other win was chris avila who likely didnt belong and will probably be cut if not after his last fight then after his next one if he loses but still even is nothing to scoff at also keep in mind that seasons tuf winner ryan hall has had fight since winning and i doubt anyone is excited to watch him fight again after that
MMA,not_removed,i think it would be a fun fight to make if cub was coming off a loss or two maybe as the fight pass prelim main event in that scenario in reality coming off wins in a row and a fight of the year contender id much rather see him against someone like korean zombie
MMA,not_removed,masvidalmaia isnt confirmed even if the fight happens it might not be at this event
MMA,not_removed,why in the fuck is cub vs a regional fighter main event because cm punk was busy that weekend
MMA,not_removed,regional main event fighter thats since tuf
MMA,not_removed,maia by backpacking round
MMA,not_removed,im sure cub will be fine artem going to have to bring nice and flowy to a whole new level i hope artem doesnt get brutally kod i actually like him unlike conors other stupid friend danis calling bones a bitch loll ive love to see those two fight hell jon could probably tap him hes so talented
MMA,not_removed,kyoji horiguchi went in the ufc and was considered a future champion by many the ufc decided not to renew his contract artem lobovs greatest success is being conor mcgregors punching bagand hes headlining a fight night against the ranked featherweight in the world cool
MMA,not_removed,people have memed themselves into bigger positions never underestimate the power of memes
MMA,not_removed,imagine the scenes if artem kos and takes a huge leap into title contention
MMA,not_removed,hands by your hips and minimal head movement combined with artems toughness are gonna make this one ugly fight the hammer is gon get bullied
MMA,not_removed,i promise this fight will be much closer than people expect i think swanson takes a decision but it wont be a wash
MMA,not_removed,hey it worked for bethe
MMA,not_removed,god i hope so
MMA,not_removed,i love cub but i honestly think fighting mcgregor would take years off his life i dont really need to see that fight though of course i would watch
MMA,not_removed,conor must delete cub
MMA,not_removed,hes never shown punch power wut thats literally he only thing he has shown
MMA,not_removed,artem knocked out straight dudes on tuf if you let him brawl with you he has pretty serious power for the division
MMA,not_removed,to be fair we had to give hendricks an extra pounds in order to make weight and we were all still nervous
MMA,not_removed,just you wait
MMA,not_removed,a guy at my jiu jitsu club has shorter arms than artem and he catches me in a darce almost every time we roll
MMA,not_removed,short arms are better for darce long arms for anaconda one of the biggest mistakes with the darce is sinking your arm too deep
MMA,not_removed,how much are tickets
MMA,not_removed,artem isnt and has never been even close to being as high up in the division as markos
MMA,not_removed,yeah well this isnt a womens division wmma is leaps and bounds behind mens in every aspect the skill level is lower the talent pool is shallower and as a result the fights are very often worse
MMA,not_removed,choi would hit him so hard hell forget the perestroyka ever happened
MMA,not_removed,i think artem would actually be a kind of tough fight for choi he definitely would be prepared for that sort of fighter
MMA,not_removed,if it wasnt cub id want it too
MMA,not_removed,i dont know he always seems to support artem
MMA,not_removed,i hope its not maia should wait for that title shot
MMA,not_removed,or the fight will be magically whisked away to delaware
MMA,not_removed,why pretend nothing changed every analyst and their mother noticed things are different now for better or worse
MMA,not_removed,its not that hes in the ufc its that hes headlining a card with a swanson that purely due to his popularity from being conors teammate
MMA,not_removed,ryan needs to stick with jiu jitsu tournaments i like ground game but watching him flop around like a fish for rounds is dumb gray didnt do anything either but ryan was more annoying neither did any damage that fight needs to be burned
MMA,not_removed,didnt kyoji just not think his new contract was enough its not like he was cut
MMA,not_removed,i like to think of this as more of a showcase for cub than an elevation for artem cub just had that foty with choi having him scrub someone would look good
MMA,not_removed,horiguchi went with the ufc with his only loss coming to mighty mouse via rd submission he is a top fighter in possibly the least popular weight class in the ufc flyweight he won fights but failed to grow his fan base its not hard to see why the ufc didnt offer him a big money contract to keep him from signing with rizen
MMA,not_removed,fuck thats depressing
MMA,not_removed,they did offer him a new contract it just wasnt enough for him so hes exploring other orgs
MMA,not_removed,you cant be boring in the ufc you gotta do a little pr
MMA,not_removed,horiguchi decided not to renew his contract not the ufc
MMA,not_removed,artem promoted the fuck out of himself on social media and kyoji didnt you want to be a big name call out a big name and rip into them over and over to get people hyped its a fighters job to entertain thats the difference between ufc fighters and olympic athletes who are watched once every four years
MMA,not_removed,the potus basically memed himself into office meme magic shouldnt be a surprise to folks anymore
MMA,not_removed,why am i not fifty memes ahead you might ask
MMA,not_removed,the messiah has spoken
MMA,not_removed,believe you me
MMA,not_removed,this is how you get everyone talking about it
MMA,not_removed,they go on sale march
MMA,not_removed,could honestly say that speaks more to the depth of featherweight more than anything else
MMA,not_removed,his baby is due to be born around the time of the fight artem said he wont be there
MMA,not_removed,hi im in delaware
MMA,not_removed,i think thats more to do with cub being really hot right now after beating choi and artem just pulling off a marquee win over a highly touted up and comer in ishihara i think cub is outside the range i would have given him but i think a ranked fight would be acceptable after that performance i think artem vs bektic or darren elkins would be more reasonable and could definitely be a co main for the same card but given the style match up and each of them coming off big wins i guess theres something there
MMA,not_removed,neither did any damage you did notice all the head kicks hall was landing right
MMA,not_removed,yeah hes honestly way more valuable over in asia until dj falls or the division suddenly gains popularity
MMA,not_removed,ufc just sold for just told the world they are clearing a year in profit and are still trying to give fighters money ffs guys
MMA,not_removed,thats exactly what this is
MMA,not_removed,he also koed three dudes hard in spectacular ways in a row on the most watched recently tuf show and has stringed together a couple good performances the win over ishihara shows me he definitely belongs in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,we love our memes dont we folks
MMA,not_removed,shades of maymay
MMA,not_removed,because youd be in jail
MMA,not_removed,buddeh
MMA,not_removed,i think it speaks more to the fact that artem is prettytovery bad by ufc standards literally the only reason hes in the ufc let alone a name is because hes friends with conor he shouldnt have even made it into the tuf house and beyond that shouldve been cut after getting destroyed by ryan hall and alex white the dude has just gotten gift after gift by riding on mcgregors coattails and this is just another example i dont fault him for it but its obnoxious that the ufc keeps giving them to him
MMA,not_removed,bektic would literally kill him and he wont do it standing having him against cub guarantees a fun war for as long as it lasts and they get either a nice highlight reel for cub or a huge upset
MMA,not_removed,those didnt look very powerful considering grays chin is suspect they were like slap kicks
MMA,not_removed,i know you probs know this but the division is never going to suddenly gain popularity
MMA,not_removed,flyweights can flywait brother wme but seriously it seems like despite how much wme and ufc likes promoting bantamweights that they fucking hate the flyweight division
MMA,not_removed,unfortunately id wager cub vs artem would out draw kyoji vs pretty much any flw now if that due to poor promotion of the division on the ufcs part or just lack of interest in the division is up for debate im forsure gunna miss kyoji
MMA,not_removed,just because artem is in a main event it doesnt mean hes getting more than what horiguchi was offered for all we know he was offered a shitload by rizin and it was just too much for the ufc to justify matching artem main eventing is certainly puzzling but i doubt hes after signing a big new contract or anything
MMA,not_removed,horiguchi is worth more to a japanese promotion than he is to the ufc and artem isnt worth much to any other promotion
MMA,not_removed,people are paid based on the revenue they bring to the company id argue more people tune in to see artem than horiguchi unfortunately
MMA,not_removed,i take it as a very bad sign of things to come yeah how dare they prioritize money as a business we need brock back to get their priorities straight
MMA,not_removed,i wish there was a button which forced a user to explain a down vote this comment is pretty much spot on in my opinion
MMA,not_removed,they were making mil in revenue not profit i understand the point youre going for but there is a big distinction
MMA,not_removed,nobody knew memes could be so complicated
MMA,not_removed,if artem wins my first thought will be going out to you my friend everyman and his dog thought ishihara would fuck artem up
MMA,not_removed,because flyweights never do good numbers
MMA,not_removed,i may be alone here but im legit excited to see kyoji wreck guys and become a star in rizin hes so much fun to watch and the japanese really need a championship caliber fighter fighting on home soil i hope they pay him a shit ton
MMA,not_removed,if horiguchi were an isolated case and there werent a rash of other baffling releases happening right now id be with you but horiguchi is just another instance in a worrying trend
MMA,not_removed,im sure they factor in return on investment there are a lot of things that can hurt your negotiating power your weight your fight style the amount you think you should be compensatedand likely deserve but the promoter is always factoring in expected value and if youre expected value isnt enough to warrant your asking fee even if you have the skills there is a likelihood the promoter will not resign you not always the case but it happens a lot
MMA,not_removed,youre seriously missing the point theyre prioritizing short term profits over maintaining the longterm legitimacy of their brand dismissing whats going on as more of the same is blatantly ignorant
MMA,not_removed,its because its obviously not the same thing the ufc had a price they were willing to keep horiguchi and horiguchi had a price in mind that made it worth it for him to stay people have wanted competition from promotions this is what it looks like horiguchi could still end up back at the ufc if it turns out the market isnt willing to give him what he thinks hes worth and hes willing to accept what the ufc is offering him
MMA,not_removed,i think a lot of people are still optimistic about where wme is taking things and hell they might be right ive been trying to give them the benefit of the doubt but the bad decisions are piling up pretty high
MMA,not_removed,ah youre right i read that wrong what kind of crazy multiple is that to get a valuation how are they valuing their assets
MMA,not_removed,and it turns out ishihara is even worse than i thought and i didnt think highly of him to begin with
MMA,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of days to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
MMA,not_removed,conor is a special case and sure in theory a conor could come along very very unlikely though conor is a normalsized person not a big dude but not tiny either in the west at least are tiny maybe if japankoreaetc get into mma in a big way well see a load of talent down there and a resulting growth in popularity but i think its unreasonable to expect casual fight fans to ever give a shit about dudes that would get crushed by their own bodyguards in a fight
MMA,not_removed,i dont agree with this statement before matt riddle fabre was the king of the bros he had amp sponsoring him when the ufc was still all about that mickeys money jose wasnt that popular outside of hardcores but that was due to him being brazilian and not an english speaker
MMA,not_removed,and the fights are hardly exciting save for or fighters
MMA,not_removed,lorenz larkin is another notable release
MMA,not_removed,damn id love a piece of that optimism but its fading more and more as things go on
MMA,not_removed,conor is worth apparently lol
MMA,not_removed,or it turns out artem was better than you originally thought give the human torso a chance my friend
MMA,not_removed,and half of the lhw division
MMA,not_removed,literally kod talented tuf prospects and got outclassed vs a really good bjj fighter not like he boasted about his bjj solid and entertaining brawler that still probably draws more than most ufc fighters
MMA,not_removed,lol i love how angry it makes you that because conor is such a success he can get special privileges for his friends how many people on tuf knocked out guys in a row i can only name as well you sad individual
MMA,not_removed,oh theyre talented now based on what exactly and who can forget the fearsome bjd fighter alex white
MMA,not_removed,i aint your friend buddeh
MMA,not_removed,wow thats some title gore how bout a downvote
MMA,not_removed,notedd my henemy
MMA,not_removed,you know whats up i bet that video is making you hungry to try it yourself
MMA,not_removed,that asshole is still being licensed
MMA,not_removed,palhares has really embraced the juice materla has balls for days to go up against that thing
MMA,not_removed,also motherfuckin sokoudjou
MMA,not_removed,paul harris is looking thicksolidtight
MMA,not_removed,ugh ive been seeing good things about ksw and now they picked up this fucking guy can you imagine being under contract and being told that you have to fight the manchild destroyer of knees
MMA,not_removed,wtf happened to emil meek
MMA,not_removed,yeah in europe were ballsac cant catch him
MMA,not_removed,cant be as bad as a guy walking out to the isis war song then having to fine him to save face like they did with that egyptian dude
MMA,not_removed,had issues with usada and not getting paperwork sent over in time will be fighting in the ufc soonish
MMA,not_removed,im not surprised lol first thing i thought when i saw him was that he had to be juicing
MMA,not_removed,not juice was due to his medication needed doctors notes he couldnt get on short notice due to public holidayweekend
MMA,not_removed,you mean people actually buy this shit
MMA,not_removed,medium waist with that extra large crotch son
MMA,not_removed,werdums charge forward after getting tagged is still the dumbest thing ive seen a champion ever do
MMA,not_removed,that immigrant mentality
MMA,not_removed,hes a world champion
MMA,not_removed,nothing better than a huge arena full of brazilians going dead quiet
MMA,not_removed,whoops forgot to trim the end sorry guys i will get better at this
MMA,not_removed,stipe won a title with the my dad is a lawyer dollars for a gram sure my name is bryce not tanner haircut
MMA,not_removed,guess running forward with your chin exposed isnt the best game plan
MMA,not_removed,just looking what werdum had to do he gets kicked out of the ufc then becomes the first person to ever defeat fedor gets resigned with the ufc goes on a winning streak defeating cainhuntbrown to finally grab his champion belt
MMA,not_removed,after werdum got clipped by that first right i cant believe he went right back at it
MMA,not_removed,one of my favorite moments last year i have a bad habit of getting absolutely trashed on fight night due to all the excitement so i always rewatch the cards in the morning in an emotionally compromised hungover stupor stipe leaping over that fence screaming im world champ was too much i cried like a newborn baby
MMA,not_removed,i love how honest stipes response was sure becoming a world champ was his goal and hed trained for that moment but when it came he just seemed like his brain shut down as he tried to comprehend that yes he was a world champ seriously endearing watching such a killer yelling like a kid on christmas
MMA,not_removed,he gets more likable every fight love stipe
MMA,not_removed,stiopic
MMA,not_removed,seriously wtf was werdum doing
MMA,not_removed,i will never understand what the hell werdum was thinking here how does such a crafty intelligent fighter do that in a title fight
MMA,not_removed,werdum has been put to sleep only twice but god damn those two times he fell like a bag of potatoes
MMA,not_removed,fixed version widescreen
MMA,not_removed,after this fight werdum has been kind of salty towards the rest of the heavyweight division
MMA,not_removed,the chris wheel kick
MMA,not_removed,aldo opening up with that aggressive against mcgregor aldo who is normally an extremely conservative starter trying to take mcgregors head off in the first exchange bad decision from a brilliant and characteristically wise fighter
MMA,not_removed,never aldos charge against mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,still baffled by it
MMA,not_removed,aldo lunging into a notorious counter striker who for a year said exactly what he was going to do
MMA,not_removed,im sure its a habit hes developed in training he got tagged before that and then ran to get one back on stipe not smart in any fight let alone against a hw
MMA,not_removed,he always does that though go watch some highlights of him sparring with some of the guys from chute box that is how he fights and trains difference with stipe was stipe is a legit counterfighter edit chute boxe fucked up the spelling there
MMA,not_removed,stiopic vs khalabib winner gets their name pronounced correctly by joey diaz
MMA,not_removed,what do you mean
MMA,not_removed,thought this thread would be a gif of stipe shouting im world champ im world champ
MMA,not_removed,just like the chicago cubs
MMA,not_removed,they showed him some hespect unlike denver haha
MMA,not_removed,reminded me of this absolutely lovely
MMA,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxutnjszjpg
MMA,not_removed,stephensjason is my personal favorite
MMA,not_removed,fuck sake steve get ya shit together
MMA,not_removed,thats the state troopa haircut
MMA,not_removed,wat
MMA,not_removed,dat white boi haircut
MMA,not_removed,salty about what i dont know
MMA,not_removed,ok yeah i feel ya bro
MMA,not_removed,hes got that immigrant mentality
MMA,not_removed,at least you can say that weidmen was trying to style on rockhold with his own style of kicks this just goes against basic fundamentals
MMA,not_removed,on top of the fact that he said exactly what he was going to do
MMA,not_removed,it wasnt a thoughwas ithe faked the right and tried to swing the left hook from the other side of the octagon with the charge he hadit actually cut conorthats the interesting partshame aldo dropped the right hand though
MMA,not_removed,theres a youtube video somewhere on youtube aldo does that charging in all his fights
MMA,not_removed,coolest thing ive seen is the side by side of the fight with conor doing the exact same thing in the locker room
MMA,not_removed,tony henderson will have something to say about that
MMA,not_removed,and kill great memes no thank you
MMA,not_removed,on a jre podcast joey diaz said miocic had that killer immigrant mentality even though hes from cleveland haha
MMA,not_removed,stipe had that killer immigrant mentality hence him winning the fight
MMA,not_removed,almost makes watching female soccer worth it almost
MMA,not_removed,haha thanks man
MMA,not_removed,what are you talking about
MMA,not_removed,yeah dunno why everyone is calling it a might be mistaken but im sure it was a straight left hook with the hook landing i still have ptsd
MMA,not_removed,the cut was from camp aldo reopened it
MMA,not_removed,only once he gets their timing down first though he rarely opens upa fight with that combo
MMA,not_removed,do you have a link to that video
MMA,not_removed,thats hilarious how did i miss that
MMA,not_removed,stiopic
MMA,not_removed,but hes croatian
MMA,not_removed,his parents are immigrants though
MMA,not_removed,oh gotcha reminder to self never to go near stipe
MMA,not_removed,the girls actually flop less and generally play harder than the guys from what ive seen
MMA,not_removed,im waiting for ya
MMA,not_removed,you had a lot of feelings about his hair i was implying that it bothered you for some reason was trying to be funny didnt land got countered
MMA,not_removed,eh he was pretty on point and repeated multiple times about what was going to happen he didnt stray to far from first first exchange ko with a left
MMA,not_removed,crazy thing was he was already out when the hook landed
MMA,not_removed,it was a gif i saw here ill check to see if i can find it when i get out of class
MMA,not_removed,haha dunno podcast was like a month ago and was absolutely hilarious
MMA,not_removed,its fixed
MMA,not_removed,ohh hes hurt mike
MMA,not_removed,oh i was just using a meme about white guys with standard white haircuts
MMA,not_removed,he was practicing the move in the back before the fight as well incredible
MMA,not_removed,generally across the board they play tough and go in hard not saying theyre maniacs tougher than the hardest dudes just no pussies unlike the mens game where theyre common far as ive seen
MMA,not_removed,i was quoting dc mate lol i always like this fight being posted so thank you
MMA,not_removed,man i hadnt rewatched in the heat of the moment i didnt catch stipe running over to check on fabricio after the celebration definitely softens the blow of my boi werdum losing his belt
MMA,not_removed,i just realized that will never be said in another broadcast
MMA,not_removed,no he said he will be done in one after being asked before the fight i dont remember him ever saying other rounds
MMA,not_removed,lol i can say the exact same about nba would you agree
MMA,not_removed,no worries man haha if theres any other fights you want me to post let me know im loving recording and uploading
MMA,not_removed,damn dude just how badly did mrvanillaicetcube hurt your feelings
MMA,not_removed,tiny percentage of men footballers are tough they are all floppers nah thats not what i said youre getting so emotional abt this its affecting your reading comprehension
MMA,not_removed,what screen recorder do you use ive downloaded one you can crop before hand and choose an area to record if you ever post my baby sonnen losing then ill put a hex on you
MMA,not_removed,so youre saying you want me to post sonnen silva
MMA,not_removed,i think its less that hes saying the men are pussiescould be exactly what he means though and more that acting like a bitch and flopping gets rewarded more in mens soccer than womens soccer which is true in my opinion
MMA,not_removed,oh that weird title fight that only went rounds
MMA,not_removed,good points man thought out too i agree i love the riskreward makes a lot of sense actually also kinda funny to me how this is an mma thread hahaha
MMA,not_removed,ill never understand the social rejects that do this
MMA,not_removed,im sure he can get it back
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure jake would the social loser an Äss kicking in real life
MMA,not_removed,so some hacker decided to steal jake shields account and basically eliminating his main platform for exposure as a fighter your ways to make money is limiting and as a fighter everything you accomplish is through blood sweat and tears time away from his girl time apart from his dad anyways just wanting to shed some light
MMA,not_removed,shouldve had a better password especially if the account is actually important
MMA,not_removed,aj
MMA,not_removed,i guess if people can report this douche it would help out
MMA,not_removed,just get nick and nate to plug his new account
MMA,not_removed,sad that they would attack a notatthetop guy its disgraceful but you could understand why these dudes attack the big fish as theres probably money in that hope it works out for jake
MMA,not_removed,thats what happens when you give spam sites like entimports access to all your social media accounts
MMA,not_removed,it was probably georges
MMA,not_removed,would go to decision
MMA,not_removed,his pets also dont forget his time away from his cat and dog
MMA,not_removed,most social media hacks arent due to a poor password and someone bruteforcing it most of the time it is either due to poor security on their email address associated with it someone social engineering their way in or using the same passwords on several different sites and one of those sites getting compromised
MMA,not_removed,im not imprezzed by youre acking skillz
MMA,not_removed,in the courts a judges decision but not in shields favor
MMA,not_removed,i get hacking and playing around but to actually delete all his pictures thats fucked
MMA,not_removed,so she might make new york after all
MMA,not_removed,he said on the video she wont fight at msg but this is dana
MMA,not_removed,what other numbered card is there in november
MMA,not_removed,there isnt but he literally said on that she will be back in november but not fighting at msg make of that what you will
MMA,not_removed,didnt he make a comment saying rouseys return would be the most televised fight in ufc history i took that as ufc would attempt to break the television ratings record with rousey maybe a call by the new owners but the next fox show which would presumably be the best place to feature a rousey fight isnt until middecember only other tv events for november include fight night in northern ireland fight night in brazil maybe against nunes and fight night in melbourne australia
MMA,not_removed,i would guess they would announce it wayyyyy ahead of time in order to build the hype up for as long as possible
MMA,not_removed,fight night in melbourne australia returning to the place that started it all rousey holm run it back
MMA,not_removed,not fair hes like way bigger than him
MMA,not_removed,that blastedmma guy actually gets commisions some of the worst work ive ever seen
MMA,not_removed,looks like theres something creepy about to burst out muhammads abs
MMA,not_removed,lmao
MMA,not_removed,a bit creepy
MMA,not_removed,they just jinxed jouban with the bigger man curse
MMA,not_removed,but why male models
MMA,not_removed,umm seriously lets take the small guy into photoshop for a sec and atleast make his skin look normal
MMA,not_removed,just the angle bro
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,looks like he got a fathead tattoo of muhammad
MMA,not_removed,are you serious i justi just told you that a moment ago
MMA,not_removed,jun at utc httpiimgurcomlgnrcpmjpg commissioned by jakesnakeryan most specific commission ive ever gotten dude knew what he wanted down to the type of shorts bj is wearing conormcgregor bjpenn superfight ufcottawa flyingknee spinningbackkick ufcedits comission jacksonwinkmma bjpenn bjpenndotcom httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,youre being hella generous in your criticism

MMA,not_removed,rogans face hahaha that is what i will miss most when he retires
MMA,not_removed,he says he wants to just play video games after retiring heres hoping he goes the rampagemm route and streams on twitch
MMA,not_removed,httpiimgurcomuzznrhejpg will be interesting to see how good chest tatt hunto is against black beast
MMA,not_removed,your move conor
MMA,not_removed,that should be hurting him a lot more than it is right in the armpit and hes smiling and joking
MMA,not_removed,wow thats a pretty bad tattoo
MMA,not_removed,mm probably gets some decent money from his twitch streaming and hunt is a bigger namewould be a good idea
MMA,not_removed,lmao he is gonna spend his life saving on a good internet connection in australia
MMA,not_removed,what types of games does hunt play
MMA,not_removed,geez i didnt know other people got that
MMA,not_removed,virtually identical
MMA,not_removed,hunt should win pretty handily even with his declined chin it would still be better than lewis hunt is far more technical and should be able to time something big to ko lewis but then again i also thought browne would win so he might prove me wrong
MMA,not_removed,jesus conor should get royalties from those tattoo artists
MMA,not_removed,wow thats sad
MMA,not_removed,hes gonna get his childs name on his forehead
MMA,not_removed,was thinking the same armpit had me tearing up trying not to be bitch
MMA,not_removed,i doubt dj would be making much from twitch he averages viewers per stream was only like a few weeks ago until a few big streamers started hosting him so unless he has a few dedicated fans donating a heap of money he wouldnt be making much
MMA,not_removed,counterstrike is the big one
MMA,not_removed,theres a video of him on youtube
MMA,not_removed,its strange but i suppose some people are willing to go to great lengths to emulate their idols i get it its still discomforting in this case though
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i agree with this hunt will probably time and set up something like the uppercut of doom on roy nelson but you just never know with the big boys swangin and bangin
MMA,not_removed,all i know is always bet on heavyweights always
MMA,not_removed,while paying nothing to the canadian model he swagger jacked ð
MMA,not_removed,ikr i cant help but pull a massive gurn anywhere near my armpit
MMA,not_removed,my bad i dont use twitch i assumed that from how much people talk about it he had at least a decent following
MMA,not_removed,in his book he talks about how much he loves counterstrike throughout and he discovered it at some lan party also credits it for helping him beat his pokie addiction
MMA,not_removed,its a good way to make your idols not want to meet you
MMA,not_removed,the thing is hunt hasnt really been kod by one shot except for like exceptions most of his tko losses are from accumulated damage whereas black beast has been banged out quick by mitrione and jordannot to mention hunts technical superiority also but momentum is truly a factor and its heavily in lewis favour
MMA,not_removed,the mans from norway ya fanny
MMA,not_removed,remember that this man took a economic horseknee to the face not long ago i guess if u choose to do that for a living pain registers in a diffrent way almost
MMA,not_removed,how much you make on twitch is dependent on subscribers ads and donations you can subscribe to a partnered twitch channel for per month and the streamer gets half so if you have subscribers for a month the streamer gets ads will depend on how many viewers you have as you make way more running ads in a stream with viewers than you would in a stream of viewers you can also donate to a streamer by giving them actual money or this new thing twitch has called bits obviously bigger streamers are going to get more frequent and larger donations however he may have a few fans who donate quite a bit of money to him there are some notoriously large donators on twitch none more so than a guy in the counterstrike community who is frequently donating to streamers
MMA,not_removed,pokie addiction is that aussienew zealand slang for heroin serious question
MMA,not_removed,hes fucking good too played some casuals with him a couple of times even though the ping was awful for obvious reasons worth it though
MMA,not_removed,i reckon that getting the same tattoo as your idol can potentially be really cool but nunchucks guy is causing that opinion to waver a bit
MMA,not_removed,i am a big believer in momentum too the sole reason i have max holloway defeating aldo
MMA,not_removed,exactly its nuts to see how much higher his threshold is than the average man reminds me of trttors armbar on jones and how he said he just had to throw the pain of a torn bicep away for the rest of the fight like thats a super simple thing to do
MMA,not_removed,none more so than a guy in the counterstrike community who is frequently donating to streamers hes actually dropped a lot on dj as well theres a little special thanks to thing in djs bio for big donators and motar is the first name there hah
MMA,not_removed,pokies are fruit machines
MMA,not_removed,nah pokies are slot machines
MMA,not_removed,aye he said he was pretty good at it i cant remember how long he said hed spent playing but i remember it being a lot
MMA,not_removed,momentum can be nullified by mental strength and just generally being a better fighter thoughcruz came in off years off and took out mizugaki who was on straight aldo schooled frankie after a devastating loss and i would say hes superior in every way except for boxing when you compare him to max itll be a sick fight though
MMA,not_removed,i guess in the heat of the moment with adrenaline flowing hard stuff feels alot less painfull combine that with these ppl being savages and we have some vicious fights
MMA,not_removed,oh shit didnt know that motar has donated so much money to streamers and it probably hasnt even put a dent in his wallet
MMA,not_removed,fruit machines im just going to stop asking questions at this point
MMA,not_removed,lmao sorry theyre like gambling machines you find them in pubs casinos clubs etc etc hunt reckons hes put hundreds of thousands of dollars in them through the years
MMA,not_removed,ah slot machines gotcha i assumed he was addicted to eating delicious fruits out of a vending machine
MMA,not_removed,haha yeah i guess where hes from theyre called pokies and where im from theyre called fruties so i wasnt sure what to say
MMA,not_removed,not surprised at allmotherfuckers
MMA,not_removed,was really hoping saffiedine could pull off the win but story is tough dude and made it a dog fight i hope saffiedine makes a quick turnaround though i like his style and his striking is awesome
MMA,not_removed,ouch getting flashbacks of barbosa vs pettis
MMA,not_removed,remember mirkos foot
MMA,not_removed,you can see the toe nail imprint gnarly
MMA,not_removed,you are footprint
MMA,not_removed,remember when he did that to lim saffiedibe is a muenster
MMA,not_removed,story ate solid head kicks too
MMA,not_removed,was the fight close i missed it unfortunately
MMA,not_removed,my personal fav yodsanklai arguably strongest kicker in muay thai chopping this guys right arm times lol
MMA,not_removed,thats got nothing on aldofaber faber was on crutches after the fight his shit was so chopped up
MMA,not_removed,it was basically a replay of storyalves
MMA,not_removed,sorry for the late reply but in case you havent seen highlights yet it was a fairly onesided fight story controlled the fight both standing and on the ground tarec definitely had some good shots at story but storys conditioningpace size big boy and constant shots to tarecs body and head garnered him a solid victory over saffedine a unanimous decision with pretty much universal agreement
MMA,not_removed,i feel ya being annoyed by typos is like being annoyed by bad kerning if you see it you see it and if it bothers you it just does also rkeming
MMA,not_removed,didnt even notice that lol
MMA,not_removed,true true fabers leg looked like it belonged to a corpse
MMA,not_removed,tarec won a round and it wasnt as one sided as you made it seem
MMA,not_removed,i browsed that sub every once in a while and thought the phenomenon was called keming it all makes sense now
MMA,not_removed,people need to keep in mind fights can be competitive but still have an obvious outcome
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,httpimgurcomamwkgg
MMA,not_removed,cheering for rose but watching goldie stroke out as he tries to say jÄdrzejczykkowalkiewicz would be great too
MMA,not_removed,i cant believe that fight interrupted my commercials
MMA,not_removed,serrano fights like im just learning a character on mortal kombat for the first time
MMA,not_removed,team benavidez vs team cejudo aka team got ktfo by mighty mouse vs team got ktfo by mighy mouse
MMA,not_removed,if i had survived that round against masvidal weight class above on short notice after coming from a decision with will brooks days ago i would have raised both of my arms pearson is a warrior
MMA,not_removed,dont worry guise only minutes of ads left until the next fight
MMA,not_removed,oh shit its time for bald dudes yelling

MMA,not_removed,max holloway is a bad influence on the ufc lol
MMA,not_removed,i just tuned in who did rey mysterio beat
MMA,not_removed,jakes not training with edmond anymore right would it be crazy of me to say that perhaps theres not a coincidence in this
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,im in acute liver failure just watching that
MMA,not_removed,pearson just fighting with his lizard brain now
MMA,not_removed,bald men screaming segment

MMA,not_removed,veterans there is a light at the end of the tunnel and the crowd goes mild
MMA,not_removed,joe sniffing out them paid gym plugs
MMA,not_removed,rofl was makin some coffee and suddenly there was a mexican gang war
MMA,not_removed,kowalkiewicz vs jÄdrzejczyk rip pronunciation
MMA,not_removed,im a huge lawler fan he is probably my favorite fighter to watch but i love this sport because i cant get mad at woodley for going out and executing a plan perfectly and getting a clean ko i appreciate everyone who steps into ringcage to fight and im glad woodley and his family get a great moment like this i was at the holly holm fight last week too and rooting for her but i cant be mad at valentina shevchenko dominating and clearly outclassing holly its definitely not like this for me with team sports and its why i appreciate mma more
MMA,not_removed,joe should have ripped of that shirt gave it to him and underneath is a tank top that says coupon code jre for all things onnit
MMA,not_removed,everything about this fight was weird the takedown techniques that primal scream at the end of the fight benoit being shattered at the serrano ddting himself the axe kicks the hip attacks the weird ass stand up benoits shoulder etc
MMA,not_removed,dude got rekt great recovery though joe
MMA,not_removed,remember to use keyword lundell for off thats o n n i t

MMA,not_removed,really want robbie to win that wonderboy fight needs to happen
MMA,not_removed,i think benoit i have no clue what the fuck i just watched
MMA,not_removed,matt brown summons the demons of bloodlust rose entertains them with a graceful dance of violence then robbie beats the soul out of a man and feeds it to them ritual
MMA,not_removed,love joes commentary of this
MMA,not_removed,joes grappling commentary on point tho
MMA,not_removed,id rather pay for the prelims and have good pacing that way i could get a second job in the time spent watching commercials and make money

MMA,not_removed,shoutout to the year old shirt
MMA,not_removed,holy shit its a new episode of bald guys yelling
MMA,not_removed,that was the crazy rogan promo
MMA,not_removed,i feel like serrano is a mma fan that was a talented wrestler and was like lemme do this shit for fun
MMA,not_removed,decision was fine takedowns were big but serrano did nothing on the ground benoit was doing damage standing up serrano wasnt doing shit on the ground good decision
MMA,not_removed,shut that mudafucker up real quick joe
MMA,not_removed,serrano probably watched mma on tv remembered he was an olympic wrestler and said fuck it i can do this shit
MMA,not_removed,you gotta let me bang bro i do let you bang
MMA,not_removed,spiderman in this hoe swangin and bangin sheeeeeeeeit dock ock tryin ta get me pregnant
MMA,not_removed,holy shit its official rafael cordeiro is a wizard he made jake ellenberger great again
MMA,not_removed,in the pro column rose is still really young and wont be receiving permanent brain damage from jj anytime soon
MMA,not_removed,yes a lot of people called it lawler had been in some serious wars and woodley is at his most dangerous early on an early ko was one of the more probable outcomes of this fight
MMA,not_removed,so uh apparently its hazardous to your health to own a ufc belt this year
MMA,not_removed,i love robbie but tyrone is a humble hardworking deserving champ crazy few years
MMA,not_removed,fuck this crowd
MMA,not_removed,damn what a start now for minutes of stalling until the next bout
MMA,not_removed,feel bad for wsof competing wit ufc on the same timeslot poor choice
MMA,not_removed,i already hate this crowd
MMA,not_removed,lmao at dominick cruz sipping the water
MMA,not_removed,he lives his life in misery how good is that

MMA,not_removed,thats brain damage
MMA,not_removed,that dude is in the upsidedown
MMA,not_removed,you have a great shirt hahahah
MMA,not_removed,he just told joe he liked his shirt this guy seems alright
MMA,not_removed,so basically what joe is telling me is that benoit is a dick
MMA,not_removed,this is a bizarre and terrible but incredibly entertaining fight serrano doesnt know wtf to do
MMA,not_removed,dont like that he didnt lose a point for intentionally throwing a punch after the bell
MMA,not_removed,rey mysterio fights in the ufc before cm punk
MMA,not_removed,shoutout to max halloway for starting a fantastic trend
MMA,not_removed,well hes crazy
MMA,not_removed,black beast in this ho

MMA,not_removed,got to be honest i didnt see that coming
MMA,not_removed,i accept the fact that this rematch is holding up the lb division but id be lying if i said i wasnt looking forward to the rematch
MMA,not_removed,robbie lawler is about one thing lists things robbie lawler is about
MMA,not_removed,the year of the dethroned
MMA,not_removed,people turning on robbie already i was never a fan all over the place

MMA,not_removed,jake by round tko love matt brown but something seems very off tonight
MMA,not_removed,jake gonna go back home to nebraska and get wasted on homemade moonshine and do burnouts on his tractor out in a cornfield
MMA,not_removed,for a high level striker velickovic didnt do shit fuck that disappointed why would he go for the takedown in the
MMA,not_removed,clearly that man needed to pay more attention to wutangs first single
MMA,not_removed,masvidal thinks this is hilarious
MMA,not_removed,ladies and gentlemen referee mark goddard has called a stop to this contest declaring the winner by banishment to the shadow realm nikita krylov
MMA,not_removed,joe he wants your shirt id give it to him if i were you
MMA,not_removed,that is a nice shirt joe

MMA,not_removed,i cant believe these are fighting on the main card of a fucking ppv
MMA,not_removed,this was like a bellator main event
MMA,not_removed,i dont know what you guys saw but i liked that serrano fight
MMA,not_removed,out of fighters have a tattoo of their last name official stats
MMA,not_removed,benoit interview almost went full douche
MMA,not_removed,this card is giving us a bunch of brawls so that we wont feel short changed when lawler vs woodley turns out to be a patient and technical fight and im ok with that
MMA,not_removed,alright lets go bro lets bang cmon bro throw down okay im tired
MMA,not_removed,this man said come on hit me my cte gives me superpowers
MMA,not_removed,holy shit thanks holloway for starting this trend
MMA,not_removed,first brock then cm punk and now rey mysterio

MMA,not_removed,i am going to home
MMA,not_removed,graves vs velickovic scorecardhttpspbstwimgcommediacopxpnovmaauzhnjpg
MMA,not_removed,we have seen less than minutes of fighting in the last hour
MMA,not_removed,matt brown just always seems like he doesnt give a shit about anything yeah swing at the ball you little shit err i mean good job son
MMA,not_removed,i thought masvidal won pretty clearly so sd for ross
MMA,not_removed,ed herman will never eat an apple again
MMA,not_removed,this card has been a banger even if the pacing has been messed up by all the early finishes
MMA,not_removed,great shirt lmao
MMA,not_removed,krylov likes joes shirt ha what was that about
MMA,not_removed,great shirt
MMA,not_removed,joe goes on to rip his shirt off and hand it to krylov
MMA,not_removed,fucking fight pass still shit no sound sort it out lads ffs
MMA,not_removed,hip strikes lol
MMA,not_removed,til you can hump someones head in mma
MMA,not_removed,sometimes joe just takes over and goes podcast mode but im ok with it
MMA,not_removed,he was obviously humping him to assert dominance
MMA,not_removed,serrano is like that guy at bjj who tries omaplatas as a white belt
MMA,not_removed,joe when have you ever seen that goldie just a moment ago but never before that mike comin in hot with his isms tonight
MMA,not_removed,it wouldnt be right if the postfight interview wasnt also bizarre
MMA,not_removed,i heard benoit took this fight on days notice can anyone verify this
MMA,not_removed,swangin and bangin
MMA,not_removed,fuck waiting for the last seconds of the fight lets just go mph for five minutes
MMA,not_removed,i wonder what max holloway thinks about this trend hes started
MMA,not_removed,is this mask a violation of reebok policy
MMA,not_removed,what makes matt scary is this music rofl joe not feeling the metal
MMA,not_removed,imma feed my kids jake
MMA,not_removed,damn at the opening bomb i thought ellenberger had him when matt got back up i thought the adrenaline dump would cost ellenberger the fight damn what a fight
MMA,not_removed,man that liver kick was so brutal that matt brown couldnt even cover up because he was holding his midsection in insane pain thats a hell of a positioned kick
MMA,not_removed,i just gotta stop being so damned nice ha haha yeah that wasnt nice nice win for him and happy birthday to his son
MMA,not_removed,the passenger awesome music choice
MMA,not_removed,kk
MMA,not_removed,so is the consensus that jj would starch both of these women
MMA,not_removed,kk rose lost that fight when she engaged the clinch looking for a takedown and got her body torn up
MMA,not_removed,joanna vs karolina and rose vs gadelha
MMA,not_removed,i cant see how one of those judges gave the second round to rose
MMA,not_removed,alright the way everythings been going lately tyron winning by flying dragon kick wouldnt even make me blink
MMA,not_removed,these british commercials are horrendous
MMA,not_removed,i like rose so im glad that karolina won so that i wont have to watch roses funeral if that fight happened she is too young of a fighter to contest joanna
MMA,not_removed,tyron just gassed running around the ring
MMA,not_removed,goldie with the weird stats
MMA,not_removed,sometimes it pays to wait for the title
MMA,not_removed,good stoppage by the ref and wow tyrone got every shot off clean
MMA,not_removed,somehow all the underdogs are winning this year by then end of the year only conor is going to have his belt because he still wont have defended it
MMA,not_removed,is officially all kinds of fucky
MMA,not_removed,guy sitting next to me at the bar called it theyre gonna rob that little guy
MMA,not_removed,hopefully t gets some respeck on his name now he just took out a savage motherfucker
MMA,not_removed,boy the amount of people picking against lawler is astounding i remember when this fight was first made most people balked at woodley getting the shot what happened
MMA,not_removed,you ever had that feeling of victory when you find dollars in an old pair of jeans i just had that when i remembered this card was today and not next week
MMA,not_removed,graves couldnt finish a fucking a sandwich
MMA,not_removed,whered the clock go
MMA,not_removed,maybe its just blind optimism and the fact that i was distracted getting food sorted but for a grindfest that fight wasnt half bad
MMA,not_removed,these damn flyweights can put on a pace man
MMA,not_removed,baby yoel romero
MMA,not_removed,he kind of looks like a little black brazilian robbie lawler
MMA,not_removed,im pretty stoked for the pearson masvidal fight

MMA,not_removed,did anyone else see dominick cruz sipping his tea like a dainty little boy ha ha
MMA,not_removed,goldberg truly is a goof i live my life in misery how good is that
MMA,not_removed,jorge smiles masvidal
MMA,not_removed,went to wrong conner hes fucking scrambled

MMA,not_removed,lawd jebus he killed that man
MMA,not_removed,he dead
MMA,not_removed,holy shit nikita deaded him with that head kick dont look now but our old friend al capone might be a lhw soon enough krylovshogun anyone
MMA,not_removed,someone finally recognizing joes classy shirts
MMA,not_removed,i kinda wanna see olivi on jre bet she has some interesting stories about some of her interviews with the fighters
MMA,not_removed,lol goldbergs pronunciation
MMA,not_removed,that shirt has been engraved on about russian tombstones worn by fat men smoking cigarettes and posed in front of a benz
MMA,not_removed,i feel like we havent had bald men shouting at us for some time
MMA,not_removed,joe that face lol

MMA,not_removed,hip knee penis strikes
MMA,not_removed,joe is ripping on serrano so hard
MMA,not_removed,lets be real here benoit got his head humped by serrano thats not a win regardless of the decision
MMA,not_removed,always wondered what would happen if after the ref asks u ready one of the guys was like nah mate gimme minutes
MMA,not_removed,perez is showing shades of cruz in his style they are training partners right
MMA,not_removed,to the top of mma reddit this fight gif goes

MMA,not_removed,imagine goldberg pronouncing kowalkiewicz and jedrzejczyk in the same sentence he is gonna have a stroke again
MMA,not_removed,take his soul robert take it

MMA,not_removed,fuck tyrons got a set of honeydews on him

MMA,not_removed,can we get diaz vs lawer now
MMA,not_removed,ufc tonight is going to have champions now
MMA,not_removed,someone called this in a preflight thread and nnnneeeewwww
MMA,not_removed,robbie still fucking smiling and acknowledging joe what a guy he was dead minutes ago
MMA,not_removed,now we just wait on the drug tests to come back
MMA,not_removed,glad woodley won but im sad i wont see lawler vs wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,nick vs lawler can be made now
MMA,not_removed,how to win a fight in just say its destiny
MMA,not_removed,so diaz v lawler now anyone
MMA,not_removed,someone needs too keep tytons momma out the club tonight
MMA,not_removed,just one punch creates that bruise god damn
MMA,not_removed,good for woodley standup guy with a great family that right hand is fucking dangerous robbie definitely got shook up hope the chin agrees with him for as long as he needs always disheartening to see someone like robbie get rocked like that
MMA,not_removed,woodley is a beast thanks for the dollars
MMA,not_removed,always hard to see your favourite fighter get beat but such is life
MMA,not_removed,and so begins another game of hot potato
MMA,not_removed,what makes me the saddest is that if rory beat wonderboy hed be facing a guy he already beat for the title
MMA,not_removed,rose didnt win out of rounds that judge needs to be retrained
MMA,not_removed,fuck benoit
MMA,not_removed,please no one complain about the judges how do you score this
MMA,not_removed,my parlay for tonight graves masvidal krylov rivera brown kowalkiewicz soulstealer bet â¬ win â¬

MMA,not_removed,pretty awkward statement there
MMA,not_removed,time wrestler time wrestler all day
MMA,not_removed,i like the decision graves didnt really do enough in the third round in terms of aggression he was winning the grappling but he was also stalling for a while during which time bojan landed shots on him good decision
MMA,not_removed,that flw pace tired just watching
MMA,not_removed,kid has potential but he fucked up swinging like that
MMA,not_removed,out of fighters are called pitbull official stats here
MMA,not_removed,rip schedule
MMA,not_removed,man if they keep this up all im gonna be watching are commercials
MMA,not_removed,the first round finishes are exciting but as soon as they happen i think fuuuuuuck now i gotta sit through more bullshit promos
MMA,not_removed,man why do the preliminaries have to be on why does comcast not have
MMA,not_removed,british ads are so fucking strange
MMA,not_removed,yair vs cacares aka the strangest headliner in a long ass time
MMA,not_removed,oh fuck pearson fucked up if he thought that was the end of the fight
MMA,not_removed,lmao pearson thought the fight was over
MMA,not_removed,man pearsons head movement is fucking nuts considering hes a zombie now
MMA,not_removed,drop him in the pot that lobster is done
MMA,not_removed,mark hunt would be proud of that one if he wasnt fighting on the internet right now
MMA,not_removed,the connection on that headkick was unreal
MMA,not_removed,good on nikita for not following up with more punches
MMA,not_removed,wow that was outta nowhere hope he is ok because he hit the deck hard
MMA,not_removed,if gingers had souls krylov would have just took hermans
MMA,not_removed,da
MMA,not_removed,hitting on joe
MMA,not_removed,dana joe what is best in life joe robbie lawler punches
MMA,not_removed,i think theyre yelling cause they cant hear each other the music in the background is super loud
MMA,not_removed,mike vickesque is he in the dogfight joe
MMA,not_removed,joes face need a screenshot of that one
MMA,not_removed,i predict bad ppv sales for this one based strictly on the fact that no one is updating wiki
MMA,not_removed,face the pain
MMA,not_removed,if your sound isnt working go to customize and switch to english or your preferred language and not default per
MMA,not_removed,i wanna see robbie ko tyron just to seehear tyrons mom freak out
MMA,not_removed,lol benoit always throwing after the bell
MMA,not_removed,benoit did the same thing when he beat sergio pettis
MMA,not_removed,benoit has always been a piece of shit
MMA,not_removed,im drunk
MMA,not_removed,you can slam your hip on a guy so you can simulate facefucking someone as long as you dont knee them
MMA,not_removed,hes face fucking him what am i watching
MMA,not_removed,serrano has a mastery of the rules if you can land hip shots like that legally
MMA,not_removed,joe getting philisophical whats a hip and whats a knee
MMA,not_removed,hittem with ur crotch george
MMA,not_removed,it would be awful to get knocked out by a fuck thrust
MMA,not_removed,no clue how to score this way too weird
MMA,not_removed,serrano fighting like a tired blanka in the third
MMA,not_removed,lol that mating call by serrano was hilarious
MMA,not_removed,judges are weird tonight
MMA,not_removed,julianna lookin bangin
MMA,not_removed,pride would have let him fight in the mask
MMA,not_removed,just bleed
MMA,not_removed,wow rivera looks like a murder victim
MMA,not_removed,that wouldve been cool with seconds left in the fight
MMA,not_removed,just bleed
MMA,not_removed,seconds of htown on that boi four minutes and thirty of chill another of htown
MMA,not_removed,looks like we have a new leonard garcia
MMA,not_removed,wtf are up with these judges ur u kidding me
MMA,not_removed,ho lee fuk
MMA,not_removed,matt brown rocking the liddell haircut but fighting like liddell
MMA,not_removed,wow ellenberger is back
MMA,not_removed,brown gets stunneddropped when he gets hit to the body so often
MMA,not_removed,kings mma best camp
MMA,not_removed,i only lost because im so damn nice and edmond
MMA,not_removed,for jamesons birthday daddy gets to keep his job lol
MMA,not_removed,great strategy there matt have been hurt to the body many times before him saying that he trained it is no surprise the move to kings mma is obviously times better than rondas camp clearly paying off ellenberger is extremely underrated he was on a losing streak against the best in the division
MMA,not_removed,back to the wall ellenberger
MMA,not_removed,i dont think either of these girls would have a chance against joanna
MMA,not_removed,did buffer just almost goof
MMA,not_removed,how are there people booing one of the most active clinches we have seen tonight
MMA,not_removed,blocks knees
MMA,not_removed,styles make fights and all but idk if what weve seen from this fight suggests either of them are ready for jj
MMA,not_removed,polish civil war in new york
MMA,not_removed,kk
MMA,not_removed,bringbackpat
MMA,not_removed,namajunas really
MMA,not_removed,those body knees lost rose the fight they just took far too much of a toll on her cardio kk
MMA,not_removed,lol bec rawlings with the biggest win streak in the division
MMA,not_removed,victory cookies for karolina
MMA,not_removed,i think gadelha could take both of these have they fought i miss claudia already
MMA,not_removed,man im rooting for robbie but ive got that feeling that an upsets coming
MMA,not_removed,karolina showed a lot of toughness and heart in this one think joanna beats her but i dont think itll be as much of a mismatch as people are saying
MMA,not_removed,now i ready are you ready spooky
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,actually really entertaining fight as a karolina fan i was just praying that rose didnt get a triangle or armbar late in the round
MMA,not_removed,whats up brother
MMA,not_removed,whats up brother
MMA,not_removed,im not gonna pretend i can call this fight im scared someone hold me

MMA,not_removed,lawler look like krillin in the face
MMA,not_removed,jesus look at the size of tyrons ass its phat as fuck
MMA,not_removed,we were all waiting for that lets be honest
MMA,not_removed,i think i won bucks holy fuck
MMA,not_removed,and all round finishes should have put more money on woodley
MMA,not_removed,hahahahhaahah i love this sport
MMA,not_removed,woodley from the whole of the uk thanks for finishing it early
MMA,not_removed,robbie takes a quick trip to the shadow realm to count his souls
MMA,not_removed,blacksplosion
MMA,not_removed,all those wars with hendricks rory and condit just to lose the belt like that this is one crazy sport
MMA,not_removed,somebody test that man
MMA,not_removed,damn rip to one of the most legendary title reigns ive ever seen even though it was short every fight was incredible happy for woodley though he seems like such a good dude
MMA,not_removed,pleeeeeeeessssseeee nick diaz v lawler please dana
MMA,not_removed,that ruined my entire weekend
MMA,not_removed,please dont come back positive for peds
MMA,not_removed,just be a commentator on and youll be a champion
MMA,not_removed,all the ufc on fox commentators are champions lol
MMA,not_removed,it seems like everyone had a sickening feeling this would happen but i guess i can go all in for wonderboy now
MMA,not_removed,lawler looks so casual about this
MMA,not_removed,no way woodley is natty
MMA,not_removed,want to be a ufc champ become a analyst
MMA,not_removed,shoutout to momma woodley
MMA,not_removed,hand down man down
MMA,not_removed,ahhhh man i feel for robbie after all them wars and battles to go out like that is hard
MMA,not_removed,if i was a contender in the ufc id be applying to get on the sports desk right away all of the main active fighters behind the desk are now champs
MMA,not_removed,robbie vs nick
MMA,not_removed,woodley just said on fox postfight show that hed be down to take on nick diaz in a couple weeks at and maybe wonderboy in november hmm
MMA,not_removed,this fucking song is so horrible but im like one of pavlovs dogs and get superexcited as soon as i hear the first couple of notes
MMA,not_removed,dick move from benoit
MMA,not_removed,would be happier with the decision if ryan benoit wasnt a scumbag
MMA,not_removed,and the crowd still boos smh
MMA,not_removed,fire that judge twat
MMA,not_removed,maybe just me but this fight is pretty amateurish
MMA,not_removed,that fight was a perfect example of the fact that takedowns dont get you points if you dont do anything with them
MMA,not_removed,lmao mexicans
MMA,not_removed,matt matt brown brown
MMA,not_removed,that liver kick would kill donald cerrones weak liver
MMA,not_removed,shout out to master cordeiro
MMA,not_removed,with rorys haircut he really had to lose
MMA,not_removed,after this i feel a woodley ko victory on the horizon
MMA,not_removed,prelims are so wack comcast doesnt even carry it
MMA,not_removed,hell of a start poor dude doesnt know where the fuck he is
MMA,not_removed,that celebration though kartwheel into belly flop haha what a fight to begin the event
MMA,not_removed,feel like its gona be a good day aussie winning got me a case of beer some cheese and picklesolives to make a platter for the main event good shit
MMA,not_removed,musclepharm and not reebok lol
MMA,not_removed,rofl his kid just fucking wrecks him
MMA,not_removed,so im at and apparently they arent selling the commentary radios this time any alternatives anyone knows of some kinda radio app or something not a huge deal but the option would be cool
MMA,not_removed,did they make this ref in caw mode
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,micheal prospect killer graves
MMA,not_removed,i think rÃ©mi gaillard has this close one
MMA,not_removed,i gotta draw
MMA,not_removed,woah graves robbed
MMA,not_removed,for the winner and this is considered a majority draw nice one brucey
MMA,not_removed,who in the fuck
MMA,not_removed,was that dude even watching the fight
MMA,not_removed,wow draw how often does that even happen
MMA,not_removed,bruce buffer be like what the fuck
MMA,not_removed,im fuckin pumped for yair vs alex no name value but such a fun matchup
MMA,not_removed,reis went from being the biggest underdog on the card to the biggest favorite
MMA,not_removed,wilson reis via elite squeeze
MMA,not_removed,mini yoel
MMA,not_removed,daniel cormier
MMA,not_removed,and here we gand it is all over
MMA,not_removed,hoiy fuck goldie liked that one
MMA,not_removed,he ded
MMA,not_removed,damn daniel
MMA,not_removed,i always get nervous when they never show a picture of the opponent on his feet after a brutal ko
MMA,not_removed,man when rose ends up fighting joanna i dont know if my heart can take it
MMA,not_removed,after two ufc fights damian grabowski has fought for has landed a total of strikes and has suffered kos mjcflipdascript
MMA,not_removed,dc has high energy tonight
MMA,not_removed,did they show a tyrone highlight from the marquadt fight lol one of the most savage finishes in the history of the sport where woodleys head bounced like a bearing in a japanese pinball machine
MMA,not_removed,i kinda sorta want rose to lose tonight because the thought of her going to joannas facial reconstruction clinic really upsets me
MMA,not_removed,these two look like the great value version of conor nate
MMA,not_removed,if nothing else pearson is game as a motherfucker props to him win or lose
MMA,not_removed,pearson is still showing good movement but masvidal is controlling the distance beautifully stefan struve and jessamyn duke take notes
MMA,not_removed,this is pearsons fight this year second this month holy shit
MMA,not_removed,i find it amazing how fighters seem to black out during fights and go into auto pilot theres no way ross will remember half of this fight
MMA,not_removed,well on the plus side pearson basically made in weeks from fighting twice
MMA,not_removed,ross is obviously concussed and is probably barely recovering come decision time who knows what his mind was doing to make him believe he was winning give the dude a break though hes a warrior
MMA,not_removed,the baseball game that pushed ufc to is to really fox
MMA,not_removed,cornrow ed looks like a huge kid rock fan
MMA,not_removed,herman is dangerous when he activates his lobster mode
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if korea will grey out hermans entire body
MMA,not_removed,ded herman am i right
MMA,not_removed,bah gawd that man has a family
MMA,not_removed,krylov just earned himself a new fan what a brutal ko
MMA,not_removed,bury him next to grabowski
MMA,not_removed,that was a squash match
MMA,not_removed,undercard of the year
MMA,not_removed,lhw just got a little bit more interesting
MMA,not_removed,fuck feel bad for ed that was just brutal then he slams his head into the mat too
MMA,not_removed,eastern europeans just taking over the ufc
MMA,not_removed,nikita krylov killed a man
MMA,not_removed,nikita the slavic wonderboy krylov
MMA,not_removed,the ufc seriously has to do a looking for a fight style show in europe to scout out new talent for their light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions dan hardy would be perfect
MMA,not_removed,ive loved krylov ever since the soa fight amazing to see how far he has come true wild man
MMA,not_removed,man i hope robbie can do it again tonight
MMA,not_removed,the bald brothers
MMA,not_removed,tyrone tyron tyrone tyron tyrone tyron tyrone tyron
MMA,not_removed,bald dudes yellin my favorite
MMA,not_removed,shouty bald guy hype extravaganzaaaaaaaa
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy called him tyrone
MMA,not_removed,damn cormier really pressed him and karyn bryant really knows her mma
MMA,not_removed,cruz being a dick at the desk to wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,fucking dom is grilling like hes a district attorney and hes pretty sure wonderboy robbed a gas station
MMA,not_removed,time to end this sufferin i need a minute to myself
MMA,not_removed,anyone else watching on xbox one i purchased the ppv and its just a black screen
MMA,not_removed,so robbie highlights are pretty much perfect for face the pain right
MMA,not_removed,i think woodley is being underrated and lawler is being overrated people seem to forget the robbie has a tendency to start slow or to take rounds off in his second fight vs hendricks he came out throwing and then slowed down for the middle rounds vs rory it took him until the to win a round vs condit he was out struck and out worked for most of the fight im not saying woodley will win but robbies rounds overshadow alot of his shortcomings its not a huge upset if woodley takes this robbie was wobbled by rory and condit who dont hit nearly as hard as woodley
MMA,not_removed,eep allelbowshttpspbstwimgcommediacoqigcaxeaazvojpg
MMA,not_removed,the ufc needs to offer a super fight pass that includes all the ppvs i order most of them but its getting kind of ridiculous these days with so many cards id be willing to pay around a month for that
MMA,not_removed,fight pass is a fucking joke
MMA,not_removed,i caved couldnt sit at home alone watching on a tiny stream went to the bar and paid them whole five dollar cover north county tavern and bowl if any rmmaers are here im the guy in the mc chris shirt i really gotta grow out my neckbeard
MMA,not_removed,the buzzer sounded ya dingus
MMA,not_removed,benoit thinks the rules are somewhat malleable
MMA,not_removed,serranos standup is literally exactly how i play ufc
MMA,not_removed,thats fuckin illegal
MMA,not_removed,i dont know what this fight is but i like it
MMA,not_removed,was that an illegal upkick
MMA,not_removed,i just realised benoit has his own name tattooed on his back i cannot support this behavior
MMA,not_removed,listen to me freeeeeeeze
MMA,not_removed,i guess its just exhaustion but i cant believe benoit isnt capitalizing on anything how many opportunities does serrano need to give him
MMA,not_removed,this third round is a shit fest of who can look the most stupid lol
MMA,not_removed,this level of conditioning wont cut it in flyweight
MMA,not_removed,insanity wins this one over sanity
MMA,not_removed,what a strange little fighter
MMA,not_removed,can you imagine any of these two fighting dj it would be complete destruction
MMA,not_removed,judges are just shrugging right now
MMA,not_removed,that was a weirdass fight
MMA,not_removed,im still trying to process what i just watched
MMA,not_removed,can we add serrano to our top please
MMA,not_removed,serrano did a ddt on himself lol
MMA,not_removed,its like serrano went into the gym and the instructor was like aite whaddya wanna learn and he says axe kick spin kick leaping punch and takedown where he cant kickknee me
MMA,not_removed,i just got an email from fight pass with the subject did you hear what goldie said theyre watching
MMA,not_removed,that was borderline experimental
MMA,not_removed,he got paid for that
MMA,not_removed,and now an infomercial perfect interview for this fight
MMA,not_removed,joe with a great charisma check
MMA,not_removed,weird ass fight
MMA,not_removed,how has the fight been so far good bad meh
MMA,not_removed,damn that ear
MMA,not_removed,is that a reebok approved luchador mask
MMA,not_removed,all he would have to do is drain his ears to make weight
MMA,not_removed,looks like weve got ourselves a mexican standoff
MMA,not_removed,oh damn dude is getting slapped by his own corner
MMA,not_removed,all this whimsy can only be leading to one thing the gods of mma are preparing for the reception of woodleys soul
MMA,not_removed,goldberg has assembled a nearly endless amount of meaningless one liners over his career
MMA,not_removed,all i can see is this ref standing a mile away and flat footed if a stoppage needs to be called he will get there next week
MMA,not_removed,he fell over swinging awesome
MMA,not_removed,wasnt smart from perez he was winning
MMA,not_removed,this ref seriously looks like he lied his ass off in the interview and now hes in the thick of the shit and just trying to get through this without looking like a total douche
MMA,not_removed,man these fights are excited but way to amateurish
MMA,not_removed,looks comfy dude
MMA,not_removed,fuck it tonight theyre jj and kk
MMA,not_removed,and nate diaz is the mcgregorweight champion
MMA,not_removed,its good to finally see some color it only took a year or so
MMA,not_removed,it happens so frequently i guess they dont care
MMA,not_removed,neither did matt
MMA,not_removed,i seriously need to stop
MMA,not_removed,raphael dos blancos
MMA,not_removed,nah its part of their new bdsm line
MMA,not_removed,the clock got bored and went to the bar
MMA,not_removed,this comment could fit well in any card
MMA,not_removed,they just spent billion bucks they aint got money to go and license a new one
MMA,not_removed,the ref suplexes you outta the ring
MMA,not_removed,that punch had such a big wind up it started in alabama
MMA,not_removed,my guess is weed but i could be wrong
MMA,not_removed,ive wrestled times i can beat them both right
MMA,not_removed,fancy mother fucker
MMA,not_removed,i
MMA,not_removed,who is that a dig at
MMA,not_removed,ali abdelaziz
MMA,not_removed,i talk a lot of shit about rda but he does seem like a really decent guy
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if he is talking about that evolution gym in singapore seems like they only wanted him there to use him for his star power i almost want to blame the loss on his going there to train
MMA,not_removed,rda is a good dude from what ive seen shame some of circle were shitty but thats always a possibility when youre successful
MMA,not_removed,referring to his tainted supplements dealer
MMA,not_removed,maybe the guy that checked his kick super hard
MMA,not_removed,i hate when they mention a situation like this but we will never find out more i must know
MMA,not_removed,what lol hes been there for ages and still is today
MMA,not_removed,reading the article i thought he was just talking about general hangerons people in the gym who latched onto his coattails when he was winning then werent as visible after he lost the belt reminds me of the gsp situation when he lost to serra suddenly the people who were telling him he was so good he didnt hafta train and he let them get into his mind he lost they disappeared and he really only had firas zihabi who stuck with him
MMA,not_removed,and cost him an absolute fortune in the process may never have the opportunity to fight for a purse that big again id be filthy with the guy too
MMA,not_removed,fair to think conor would have beaten him if that guy never checked the kick
MMA,not_removed,really i didnt know that happened article
MMA,not_removed,nah rda would have been a legit threat
MMA,not_removed,think conor would have gotten fucked up especially where his mindset was at the time
MMA,not_removed,no
MMA,not_removed,i honestly agree after seeing what alvarez did to rda i reckon conor would have kod him im a conor fan so i probably have some bias
MMA,not_removed,i dont train how do you check a leg super hard explode and lift your leg rather than just lifting the leg normally
MMA,not_removed,you conner fanboys crack me up
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,especially where his mindset was at the time salient point being humbled by nate may have been just the tonic he needed to get his head straight again
MMA,not_removed,to be fair thats looking a bit with hindsight he very well could have lost to nate because he was training for rda i think he was also humbled a bit but i dont think its fair to nate to say mac lost because of arrogance
MMA,not_removed,why not
MMA,not_removed,conor always said before this fight he always focuses on himself and doesnt game plan for people im not sure how true that is though at the time thats all he was saying suddenly hes saying he was preparing for rda not nate people now just assume conor would have easily won because rda got knocked out but rda was absolutely smashing killers i think rda would have had almost every advantage but conor also could have knocked out rda i was more interested in that fight over the nate fight sucks it didnt happen i guess its hard to not look at everything with hindsight at the time conor just came off a bad performance against chad and then he knocked out aldo so fast we didnt see how that fight would have played out if they actually had some exchanges i had questions about conors ability against top tier fighters now after i dont have the same doubts about conor then on the other hand rda looked unbeatable but now we dont know how he will come back
MMA,not_removed,because rda is an incredible fighter
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats true maybe im guilty of the same hindsight bias after seeing i personally dont believe that conor didnt prep for people but i could see how that would be a convenient narrative for his camp id still like to see them fight soon maybe someday at least youre right about aldo i hope if they do fight next that theres more to that fight but i do also agree that it was pretty definitive last time
MMA,not_removed,he sure is still isnt a reason why conor couldnt beat him
MMA,not_removed,with a suspect chin no way rda couldve eaten the kind of shots nate did
MMA,not_removed,nates shots rocked conor in the first fight and rda hits harder so silly to say one guy cant eat shots but another can everything is relative regarding blows to the head
MMA,not_removed,where did i say conor could eat rdas shots
MMA,not_removed,high quality mirror
MMA,not_removed,at least we get woodley vs wonderboy quickly no damage taken
MMA,not_removed,well i was tonight im going to bed
MMA,not_removed,rip champions in
MMA,not_removed,good luck holding onto a belt this year
MMA,not_removed,fuck you mma im being emotionally abused by this sport
MMA,not_removed,holy shit tyron woodley by nuclear ko the speed on that right hand robbie literally didnt even react ffs i think it even shocked big dan he could have stopped the fight punches earlier without contention
MMA,not_removed,the mma gods are dead and we killed them
MMA,not_removed,jesus woodley is like the result of putting all your character points into one skill tree
MMA,not_removed,i dont think lawlers chin is shot those punches would have knocked out an elephant
MMA,not_removed,betting on every underdog for all of
MMA,not_removed,now i wanna see nick diaz vs lawler rematch
MMA,not_removed,by the end of the year only conor will still have the belt because he still wont have defended it
MMA,not_removed,robbies been my favorite fighter since his first ufc run the last couple of years have been so much fun and i hate that his reign is over
MMA,not_removed,so does woodley consume all of the robbies souls that he ate too or just robbies
MMA,not_removed,year of the upset
MMA,not_removed,fffffuuuuuuu i adored champion robbie that hurts
MMA,not_removed,round lawler and round woodley they need to fight in the round to make it fair
MMA,not_removed,what a nasty right hand lawler respectful as always great card
MMA,not_removed,please dont ever use stationfy again
MMA,not_removed,round woodley
MMA,not_removed,anything is possible
MMA,not_removed,tyron rumble woodley
MMA,not_removed,really puts andersons title defense run into perspective
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck is going on this year
MMA,not_removed,thank you for the woodley httpiimgurcomwuewauzpng
MMA,not_removed,wow that sucks to see as a lawler fan heres hoping woodley vs wonderboy happens sooner rather than later
MMA,not_removed,i hope you all enjoyed the robbie wars up to this point because it doesnt get pretty from here on
MMA,not_removed,gimme diaz vs lawler
MMA,not_removed,holy shit
MMA,not_removed,fucking startched that was on par with a rumble punch
MMA,not_removed,the ironic thing being miraglliotta separated these two from the cage way too quickly when woodley was trying to take him down and then seconds later this happens
MMA,not_removed,best example of blacksplosive to date
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy rubbing his hands and smiling right now
MMA,not_removed,mirror
MMA,not_removed,part of me still cant believe that this is the same guy that used to put on some of the most consistently boring lay and pray back in strikeforce that brutal ko loss to nate marquardt must have really had an effect on him
MMA,not_removed,it hurt watching lawler trying to get back up while still dazed and the ref having to stop him from falling
MMA,not_removed,if you sit at the analyst desk youre a champion cormier woodley cruz hell even bisping got it done
MMA,not_removed,woodley via blacksplosiveness
MMA,not_removed,ctrlf blacksplosive results truly no more fitting a term for that knockout edit current blacksplosive count
MMA,not_removed,fucking hell with woodley throwing himself into the basket its getting really crowded at the top of ww him wonderboy maia rory robbie who can still bounce off decrease from now on is more likely but its ruthless anything is possible condit and add nick diazs return as well i would like to have stephen as a dominant champ but he for example lost his only fight to a guy whos never been knocked out until today so point is anything can happen and we dont know shit
MMA,not_removed,condit lawler lets go
MMA,not_removed,holy shit i really didnt think woodley deserved the shot at all but i thought he had a chance because robbies fights have been close but wow i never expected that at all that was a brutal shot in the first round too great fucking win by woodley wonderboy vs woodley will be crazy
MMA,not_removed,as a lawler fan im not surprised just bummed props to woodley though that was one hell of a knockout wonderboytwood and conditlawler ii are the fights to make next
MMA,not_removed,damn i was hoping robbie was going to reign the division for a long time insane also it feels like every main event from the past year was an upset
MMA,not_removed,holy crap lawler got sent to the shadow realm
MMA,not_removed,idk if this made it to broadcast but there was an incident with a group of fans during lawlers entrance idk exactly what they did but there was a huge commotion when robbie walked past them and like security guards came over and hopped into the stands and kicked their asses and threw em out of the stadium ellenberger was celebrating hard with the same dudes when he won so there might be some mma beef goin on or something if anyone has more detail on what happened id love to know another weird part of this was every fighter the entire night came out the same corner of the arena robbie was the only one on the entire card to walk out of that corner of the stadium and the incident happened with the fans right on that corner of the stadium whole thing was weird as fuck
MMA,not_removed,ouch that fucking hurt
MMA,not_removed,and now we sit back and wait for the hot piss
MMA,not_removed,this just allows me to appreciate rory mcdonald a hell of a lot more
MMA,not_removed,man this is definitely one weird year
MMA,not_removed,mirror
MMA,not_removed,its amazing to me that these dudes are in the same weight class they look so different
MMA,not_removed,people were saying robbie taking all that damage was a recipe for his downfall why am i still so fucking upset why am i so fucking sour that it was woodley to do it jesus fucking christ
MMA,not_removed,not like this
MMA,not_removed,lawler diaz book it dana
MMA,not_removed,that power is crazy congrats to woodley for shutting everyone up who looked past him
MMA,not_removed,and now begins our unquestionable worship of woodley until he gets beat
MMA,not_removed,what happens when a soultaker gets his soul taken
MMA,not_removed,lawler is tough as nails but woodley is ridiculous and his power is out of this world what a shot lot of people called that happening and i won a lot of money from it congrats to woodley
MMA,not_removed,nobody even gave the dude a chance and he just knocked robbie the fuck out
MMA,not_removed,that seperation was the worst thing for robbie
MMA,not_removed,goddamn what a punch i was expecting lawler to grind out a win but just damn congrats to woodley that was a nuke of a punch
MMA,not_removed,round woodley round lawler
MMA,not_removed,so many people talking about how woodley didnt even deserve this fight this is why i love mma
MMA,not_removed,this beautifully sets up woodley vs marquardt
MMA,not_removed,i had a bad rda vs eddie feeling when the fight started i wanted to see how woodley looked after usada thinking he would be less muscular but he still looked as menacing as ever dang i wish robbie had reigned a little longer
MMA,not_removed,guys is this really a steroid node i dont wana believe these mean roids
MMA,not_removed,lmao some lawler nuthugger going and downvoting any and every prowoodley post
MMA,not_removed,is it time for lawler diaz ii or does diaz need to defeat a top fighter first
MMA,not_removed,that freaking w bomb man i was just showing my friend what happened when he dropped it on koscheck
MMA,not_removed,pow right in the kisser
MMA,not_removed,i think jack slacks made a point of woodleys move that he did on lawler i recall seeing gifs of it in the article
MMA,not_removed,if you a ufc champion hide yo kids hide yo wife
MMA,not_removed,so the ufc on fox panel are all champs right now
MMA,not_removed,is there another link for some reason it does not load
MMA,not_removed,btt
MMA,not_removed,lol to everyone writing woodley off holy fuck
MMA,not_removed,i hope people apologize to tyron for shitting all over him for waiting
MMA,not_removed,this sport be crazy
MMA,not_removed,both hands away from his face lawler trying to swat a mosquito on woodleys shoulder
MMA,not_removed,we all knew that woodley had a shot at koing lawler but man he really did it lets see if he can hold onto it or not
MMA,not_removed,yall go ahead and talk shit about sherdog now
MMA,not_removed,i had a weirdbad feeling about this one the old heart wanted lawler so bad but my brain felt like woodley was gonna take this one and ruin the day
MMA,not_removed,am i the only one becoming numb to these huge upsets they seem to happen every month or so
MMA,not_removed,im so happy for woodley hes always seemed so nice and everyones always given him shit hes called undeserving a gasser a whiner and a bunch of stuff people were overlooking him and hardly anyone predicted him he can be called anything but no one can take away that hes a world champ now
MMA,not_removed,is it weird i want to see maia vs woodley
MMA,not_removed,the one fight i think robbie should win he gets destroyed
MMA,not_removed,tyron was fast af with that right hand him and wonderboy should be fun power speed wrestling vs accuracy patience and excellent movement atleast now we can see lawler vs diaz
MMA,not_removed,seven flips this year
MMA,not_removed,robbie vs nick pls
MMA,not_removed,that was a genuine upset such a long lay off for pretty a one punch ko would have like to see it go longer love robbie so this is a downer for me but anyone can be caught on the chin on the right night
MMA,not_removed,my nachos i just spilled my nachos everywhere
MMA,not_removed,no one is safe
MMA,not_removed,shows you how hard of a chin condit has he took a few of those in their fight and he was coming forward during them
MMA,not_removed,woodley vs condit stronger knees
MMA,not_removed,dude wiped him
MMA,not_removed,woodley is unscathed maybe we can have woodley vs wonderboy in months
MMA,not_removed,how often have we seen lawler eat shots thats either serious power or serious luck its a wonderful sport when the flip of a coin can create the outcome
MMA,not_removed,speed beats power
MMA,not_removed,am i the only one who watched lawler make the same movement to the left and right he was extremely predictable right before the ko he took the same steps to the left and right and i though hes gonna walk right into woodley right hand sure enough
MMA,not_removed,i kind of blame myself i jinxed lawler by thinking it was a guarantee he was going to win i was actually already thinking about the fight with wonderboy first rockhold now lawler my god i should have known
MMA,not_removed,i live in st louis woodley is from stl for a city that is in love with itself and never passes up a chance to pat themselves on the back tw has never been mentioned on the news not once i was rooting for robbie but i hope at least locally woodley will get the recognition he deserves and fuck st louis by the way it is the worst for anyone who missed it
MMA,not_removed,cant wait to see how woodley will solve the thompson puzzle
MMA,not_removed,i picked woodley and ellenberger and got the method of victory correct for both i feel on top of the world
MMA,not_removed,another champ bites the dust good for twood id love to see a condit vs woodley rematch hope carlos gets it done against maia
MMA,not_removed,its the fight game and everyone in this game has all the skills now to win and lose on any given night noting to be sad about for robbie he had a good fucking run with the belt
MMA,not_removed,this made me legit sad
MMA,not_removed,im not too happy about robbie losing but god damn that right hand hit him like a piston
MMA,not_removed,its like musical chairs where you punch people in the face for a chair
MMA,not_removed,scariest baby duck in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,i kind of thought it was gonna be like this one way or the other woodleys money punch is his right hand and lawler is a southpaw they are both more easily able to land their power hand on each other
MMA,not_removed,i called that shit woodley got those hands and power
MMA,not_removed,the ol right there fred
MMA,not_removed,its like i dont even know you anymore ufc
MMA,not_removed,was hoping for a lot more action than that not lawler vs mcdonald levels of action that got kind of disgustingly violent but more action than that
MMA,not_removed,dom cruz cormier bisping and woodley all the fox sports analysts are champs now sketchy sketchy
MMA,not_removed,wtf they didnt even use chairs if youre going to have a fake fight at least make it fun
MMA,not_removed,not surprised he caught him still doesnt change who woodley is hes rumble back at i dont think woodley could even go rounds can barely go
MMA,not_removed,i was at a bar in mexico when i saw this fight lawler literally is my favorite fighter in the buisness right now i teared up after i saw this such a heartbreaking thing to see because i talked him up to all my friends who were new to the sport the one thing i regret the most is not being able to hear a damn word that was said the bar was loud and everything was being translated to spanish so i couldnt tell how lawler reacted fast forward to this morning i woke up to watch this fight with the original audio and the follow up octogon intrrview and the way lawler handled his defeat made me cry this guy was so fucking humble and i no longer felt that weird sadness eating at me i felt sad because i hyped myself for this fight for a solid week and watched some of his training videos the fact everyday he worked his ass off to defend all to just wash away in a blink this is the greatest sport because it touches me in such an incredibly different kind of way moreso than any other sport on earth and the sportsmanship from lawler and pure class makes me absolutely love the guy
MMA,not_removed,if youre a woodley fan i wouldnt celebrate until usada gives results
MMA,not_removed,wait people are suprised that the brawler who eats punches like pancake was kod by the explosive one punch ko black guy damn i should have made bets
MMA,not_removed,i called this earlier today i knew this would be a chuck liddell vs rampage jackson situation fighters like liddell and lawler cant fight that way forever beautiful work woodley lawler finally got that first round ko he was looking for
MMA,not_removed,condit called it
MMA,not_removed,you always end up on somebodys highlight reel
MMA,not_removed,good stoppage
MMA,not_removed,hard to imagine that nate marquardt beat this man long ago
MMA,not_removed,saint louis has a champion holy shit
MMA,not_removed,good on tyron hes one of the nicest in the sport and truly earned this moment i love hearing him behind the desk commenting but man im glad hes about to get active again this new training situation and him already calling out diaz wonderboy and the rest has got me ready for some fireworks couldnt be happier for him and its that much sweeter after seeing round robbies very suspicious hormone levels before this fight just like jons rapid bodybuilding when these fighters show off these exceptional physical attributes its disappointing to see the usada results show how bold they were right in front of our faces
MMA,not_removed,now we await the test results
MMA,not_removed,so happy for woodley
MMA,not_removed,sorry robbie
MMA,not_removed,round robbie one round woodley
MMA,not_removed,here from rall how did he win that did the ref call it once the guy was on the ground
MMA,not_removed,is one helluva year
MMA,not_removed,wow that was pretty impressive performance with his long time off i kind of forgot what woodley could do
MMA,not_removed,thank god im not a betting man
MMA,not_removed,what is this fucking year
MMA,not_removed,i was expecting a rounds war
MMA,not_removed,what a shot by woodley i didnt expect robbie to lose
MMA,not_removed,god dammitwanted to see more
MMA,not_removed,god dammit there goes bucks
MMA,not_removed,reminded me of the rda v alvarez fight
MMA,not_removed,i almost dont believe this just happened holy shit that was crazy
MMA,not_removed,crazy that so many people wrote him off dude has brick hands
MMA,not_removed,god damn
MMA,not_removed,ho ly shit i cant believe what i just saw
MMA,not_removed,power no head movement naptime i was looking forward to seeing whether or not woodleys cardio would hold up vs championship rounds robbie guess he preempted that
MMA,not_removed,the stats dont lie props to woodley
MMA,not_removed,wow explosive ko i was not expecting that
MMA,not_removed,and he didnt deserve it right
MMA,not_removed,wow just wow
MMA,not_removed,absolutely shocking cant count anyone out even if theyre coming back from an month hiatus
MMA,not_removed,and thats why you keep your guard up when fighting someone with that much power
MMA,not_removed,i definitely saw woodley koing lawler early as a possibility still surreal seeing him as the new welterweight champion has been just as crazy as
MMA,not_removed,the year of the underdogs
MMA,not_removed,glad woodly won people kept sleeping on him even tho he wad working cobdit when they fought also glad he won so now people could stop acting like no one is beatable
MMA,not_removed,now realize how apeshit itll be wonderboy vs woodley shieeeeeet
MMA,not_removed,im the best welterweight in the world
MMA,not_removed,what can you do against the machine
MMA,not_removed,that right hand was so fucking fast jesus
MMA,not_removed,god damn all the champs are getting knocked out in the first round aldo werdum rockhold dos anjos and now lawler wanted to see all those guys go down fighting not with a round ko
MMA,not_removed,glad to see woodley get the belt guy seems nice hope hell fight more now that hes not waiting on a title shot though
MMA,not_removed,doot fuckin doot
MMA,not_removed,that one punch not only took out lawlers head but took out several matches and rematches i wanted to see
MMA,not_removed,black hendo
MMA,not_removed,how long did lawler defend his belt
MMA,not_removed,been saying since gsp that woodley was gonna be champ some day well done ty
MMA,not_removed,man tyron is ripped what would happen if he failed the pre fight tests would the belt go vacant or back to lawler in the event of a nc either way that was a good feint with the left to throw him off and hit him with the big right
MMA,not_removed,i liked how woodley said he wasnt happy because he koed his teammate he was happy cause he became the champ but you gotta question that physique man its unreal
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,koscheck needs to hold a seminar for everyone titled tyron woodley he is really fucking fast
MMA,not_removed,damn watching robbie after the fight made me sad such a tough dude but we knew if woodley was going to win this would be how
MMA,not_removed,fuck
MMA,not_removed,whoooooah
MMA,not_removed,so how about diaz lawler ii
MMA,not_removed,robbie vs nick make it happen dana
MMA,not_removed,weeeowww
MMA,not_removed,i called it too man i knew tyron would shock all the haters
MMA,not_removed,his speed and hands remind me of a young and fresh rashad
MMA,not_removed,someone yelled out harambes revenge so disrespectful
MMA,not_removed,gotta start betting with my gut even tho i thought woodley would win i didnt see a round one ko ever happening
MMA,not_removed,i like tyron im just a little disappointed to see robbie lose
MMA,not_removed,mma is a brutal and unforgiving sport
MMA,not_removed,man i fucking love this sport you never know what the fuck is gonna happen rory beats woodley lawler beats rory woodley beats lawler mma math will never work styles make match ups period
MMA,not_removed,damn for those wondering first time lawler has been koed since that was a nuke holy shit thanks for the mirror main page is broke reddit hod
MMA,not_removed,that is one strong fence
MMA,not_removed,pretty blatant fence grab there ref should take a point
MMA,not_removed,i know it would be kinda dick but if you repost the mirror you would get a bunch of sweet karma and plus the op woouldnt load for me thanks for the mirror you are doing gods work
MMA,not_removed,ty
MMA,not_removed,remember to avoid mirrors getting removed from comments always link them as bryan caraway gossip
MMA,not_removed,that guy is a million times more roided up than jones
MMA,not_removed,he may have ripped a finger or two off with the force of that fence pull at the end there
MMA,not_removed,apparantly he suffered a neck injury from ducking wonderboy so quickly
MMA,not_removed,yeah for real rose brown and lawler gg
MMA,not_removed,my only right bet was masvidal out of
MMA,not_removed,got karma for commenting fuck you rmma jake ellenberger on the fight thread after that fight and karma for posting fuck you rmma tyron woodley on the same thread after this fight been a pretty good night for me
MMA,not_removed,makes two of us
MMA,not_removed,except mm
MMA,not_removed,is the first year of the no champions test program if it works out well phase them out completely
MMA,not_removed,no more heroes in mma
MMA,not_removed,usada
MMA,not_removed,my current theory is that the champs we had were there only because they had the best drugs and now usada has cleaned them out of their belts
MMA,not_removed,title changes in dillashaw to cruz ufc fight night january holm to tate ufc march werdum to miocic ufc may rockhold to bisping ufc june dos anjos to alvarez ufc fight night july tate to nunes ufc july lawler to woodley ufc july
MMA,not_removed,kind of makes you respect guys like gsp a little more being able to hold the belt for so long not easy to do
MMA,not_removed,my first thought too i honestly feel wonderboy will demolish tyron
MMA,not_removed,im kind of tired of new champions the ufc needs some dominant heroes for a bit excluding mm who is a god but doesnt seem to inspire the masses like the old champions fedor silva gsp etc
MMA,not_removed,you got to give woodley some credit he had lawler too cautious and his speed in his attack had lawler guessing i can see tyrone with the tko against wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,lawler was of only to do it this year lol
MMA,not_removed,its like the game of thrones of sports
MMA,not_removed,for real rose and robbie losing got me poppin zoloft
MMA,not_removed,its a perfect year for the lovers of the sport in general i just love the unpredicatbility you never can tell these days except for mm
MMA,not_removed,that emotional abuse is what makes this sport so fucking awesome though anything can happen and the tide can turn quicker in a fight than any other sport on the planet i fucking love it
MMA,not_removed,thank fuck i dont bet on mma what a loser id be
MMA,not_removed,that punch caught me off guard i nearly choked on my drink damn
MMA,not_removed,gonna guess woodley doesnt have the belt long but all his remaining title fights will be spectacular
MMA,not_removed,those finishing touches wouldve killed me
MMA,not_removed,blacksplosiveness
MMA,not_removed,believe it or not robbie was right that feint did it he let it sneak by because he dropped after the first fake and that was all she wrote
MMA,not_removed,the speed on that right hand robbie literally didnt even react he actually did react tyron threw a feint first and robbie reacted to it which i couldnt believe to be honest
MMA,not_removed,its a race for karma with each fight some guys even post the finishes from multiple organizations on the same night within seconds of it taking place its like theyre sitting there with half a dozen browsers open ready to go
MMA,not_removed,whats a god to a non believer
MMA,not_removed,that skill tree being blacksplosiveness
MMA,not_removed,thats unfair he can wrestle very well
MMA,not_removed,blacksplosiveness is broken af
MMA,not_removed,since he won like this i can put away that ultra combo that nate marquardt put him away with
MMA,not_removed,woodley is more like the result of playing through the game once to get a feel for which stats are worth upgrading reading all the patch notes and then starting a fresh character and spending an hour in the creation screen on the body shape
MMA,not_removed,might be shot now tho
MMA,not_removed,makes you appreciate condit how he took those woodley shots i have no idea
MMA,not_removed,that would just make them the favorites
MMA,not_removed,ive done that since and made some decent money but i dont think ill do it for considering the freak show of a main event
MMA,not_removed,woodley called out nick
MMA,not_removed,would be a nice fight for lawler a superfight with a big paycheck for both of em while wonderboy faces woodley
MMA,not_removed,who is going to beat mighty mouse
MMA,not_removed,he is one of my favs too and i gotta say if he had to lose the belt i would have wanted it in a different way like i rather robbie lose to wonderboy via decision than a guy who hasnt even fought forever and the first round no less my god
MMA,not_removed,you know it shows how much respect everyone has for lawler that most were picking him when this was always a very real outcome everyone just assumed robbie would be savvy enough to avoid that shot until things slowed down robbie wont be remembered in the goat arguments but i think hell always be carried by the massive loyalty he earned from all of us who got to watch him compete
MMA,not_removed,scientifically speaking woodley just gets one soul but that soul has the combined power of all the previous souls it absorbed
MMA,not_removed,tyron robbie lawler woodley
MMA,not_removed,is alistair overeem the underdog
MMA,not_removed,he was only
MMA,not_removed,this wasnt even an upset imo
MMA,not_removed,he really was the best champ you could ask for humble crazy dedicated and only slightly better than his competition
MMA,not_removed,i think woodleys punch went right through the screen because as soon as that shit happened i hung my head like i just got knocked the fuck out how the hell am i supposed to sleep tonight knowing this just happened agh
MMA,not_removed,it was great except for that first fight on the main card looked like dudes just fucking around in a light sparring session
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,forgive my ignorance but why
MMA,not_removed,the only thing the soul eater ate was woodley punches
MMA,not_removed,kids you can literally fly jump on your friends back and run onto the freeway you are literally invincible you cannot die
MMA,not_removed,this shit is inspiring if anyone can get beat i can turn my life around
MMA,not_removed,and gsp for that matter
MMA,not_removed,and he made it look easy too none of the wars that robbie had
MMA,not_removed,mma is going on and its insane
MMA,not_removed,im so glad im not a betting man bc i would literally be broke
MMA,not_removed,usada been dropping the dick hard on mma
MMA,not_removed,hey its me ur brother
MMA,not_removed,also for the Â£
MMA,not_removed,shoulda bet p
MMA,not_removed,how the hell you get him at he went off at at fight time i got him winning in the first
MMA,not_removed,yea but i still see lawler being a top contender and possibly getting a rematch soon
MMA,not_removed,its the obvious next fight the question is who after that maia or does he fight someone else like lawler first
MMA,not_removed,i dont think that ko was a result of wars i think that punch would ko anyone regardless of their wear and tear the issue was lawler coming out slow and letting someone as fast as woodley set the pace
MMA,not_removed,yea it was a good run
MMA,not_removed,opens the door for a rory vs robbie rematch though cant see that fight being anything but solid
MMA,not_removed,i love lawler but i would not be surprised if this was the beginning of a sharp decline for him i hope its not but ive been watching for enough years and ive seen enough chins give out on fighters whove been around as long as he has
MMA,not_removed,woodley says he wants diaz at the post fight id rather see that for the title mother fucking yes maybe ufc can be for two titles in stockton
MMA,not_removed,i mean he could have waited another seconds and nobody would have a problem but there was literally no movementattempt to progress at all so personally i was ok with that decision
MMA,not_removed,i honestly didnt think so when i saw what woodley was doing i immediately thought hes stalling im guessing the ref thought the same thing
MMA,not_removed,that was a really weird separation it was so damn quick
MMA,not_removed,miraglliotta sucks bad break up
MMA,not_removed,you could say it actually benefited woodley without that distance he wouldnt have gotten off the blitz shots but who knows
MMA,not_removed,crazy to think how rory was able to nullify that
MMA,not_removed,would like a word
MMA,not_removed,i had a feeling he would win because of this wonderboy said on the prefight show that lawler stands and bangs and thats a bad thing against someone with black power
MMA,not_removed,makes me wish we wouldve seen woodley vs johnson back in the latters skinny days
MMA,not_removed,rumble has got to be up there
MMA,not_removed,not even close
MMA,not_removed,i hope dana doesnt make us wait too longboth fighters are ready to go tomorrow
MMA,not_removed,you saw what he did to hendricks he could do that to robbie hes kinda fucked now because woodley is a good wrestler
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy was badly hurt by ellenberger in there fight hes not invincible no one is
MMA,not_removed,kenny florian vs conor confirmed
MMA,not_removed,id throw kelvin gastelums name in that bunch
MMA,not_removed,winner fights wonder boy for the belt cause woodley aint surviving that mother fucker
MMA,not_removed,that was never going to happen only reason he still had the belt in the first place were a couple controversial decisions
MMA,not_removed,they also didnt give the guys in the first fight any clue on where theyd be leaving from so they walked around and back to the entrance gate then got turned around back to the exit gate gate lawler entered from i saw after his teammate got a w but didnt want to take away from his boys win by trying to get a picture with him
MMA,not_removed,i bet it didnt he was unconscious pretty quickly
MMA,not_removed,you mean robbies because hes the one with the suspect hormones leading into this fight and during
MMA,not_removed,rory must be sick someone he already beat has won the title from his biggest rival not to mention he just lost to the top contenders
MMA,not_removed,but not woodley
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,woodley is and lawler is so it kinda makes sense
MMA,not_removed,i think people tend to underestimate the impact of a sheer size and length advantage in a fight jon jones for example only really had trouble with gus in all of his fights
MMA,not_removed,now these guys are bitter saying lol good luck holding on to the belt woodly or wonderboy will finish you pathetic little kids
MMA,not_removed,now people are giving him shit for winning its a lose lose for the man i love that stl just got a belt
MMA,not_removed,well at least he was humble and gracious toward robbie in the post fight interview if that means anything
MMA,not_removed,why am i so fucking sour that it was woodley to do it cause it proves that he was right to pull an achilles and sit in his tent i dont mind it but a lot of people found it weird
MMA,not_removed,nah people are writing him off already even though hes good and getting better and him evolving in his time off is going to keep showing as he becomes more active
MMA,not_removed,nah wonderboy is where its at
MMA,not_removed,all his banked souls are transferred to his souls new owner minus a transaction fee taken by dana
MMA,not_removed,they also said rda wouldnt get past pettis and that alvarez wouldnt get past rda and that holly wouldnt get past ronda and the best of all was bisping koing rockhold for the belt this past year i have learned that literally anything can happen they can match mighty mouse up against a turd from the toilet and the turd just might knock him clean out in the first round
MMA,not_removed,he didnt though which doesnt mean he didnt have the tools to win its just that people dont think he deserved to be in that stage not that he couldnt perform on it
MMA,not_removed,not as big an upset as rockhold getting kod by bisping but same kind of thing now well probably see hendo ko bisping
MMA,not_removed,they are bitching about ped lol
MMA,not_removed,timing beats speed
MMA,not_removed,falls into the same category as aldo v mcgregor for me i wanted to see the martial arts chess match that was solving the problem the other presented nothing wrong with what happened in either case thats the nature of the sport any given moment the match can be over
MMA,not_removed,yeah robbies hormone levels looked really suspect so he might get disqualified for sure
MMA,not_removed,to be fair woodley is one of the most tested guys since usada started testing times this year last time i checked if he is on the peds his doctor is doing a good job or hes lucky as hell
MMA,not_removed,easy to call that now
MMA,not_removed,could have been a couple punches sooner imo
MMA,not_removed,robbie white guy took several hard shots with no response so the ref stopped it due to lack of intelligent defense blocking shots moving to avoid them clinching to stop big strikes etc basically robbie was being beaten senseless without fighting back so the fight was stopped
MMA,not_removed,against rory and condit i believe
MMA,not_removed,robbie is the only one with suspect hormones bruv
MMA,not_removed,most likely would end in a nc belt would be vacated with lawler fighting wonderboy for the title
MMA,not_removed,robbie has suspect hormone levels posted so i would look where the evidence is instead of speculation when usada has tested him times before this bout
MMA,not_removed,yeah my thoughts too way way bigger than robbie dude is ripped
MMA,not_removed,sure lets give a guy who hasnt won a fight since a fight with the guy who just lost his belt minutes ago
MMA,not_removed,for hating being called explosivedude stfu your explosive
MMA,not_removed,the crazy part is that he never seemed to go fully out how he didnt stiffen up for a few minutes on the canvas is crazy
MMA,not_removed,thats also age and accumulation
MMA,not_removed,the way the fight shifted made my jaw drop lawler starts out by literally pushing woodley to the outside with pressure alone somehow woodley reverses this with his own pressure and lawler starts moving on the outside it was then that i realized lawler genuinely was concerned of woodleys power
MMA,not_removed,you can thank emmanuel yarborough for the improved engineering
MMA,not_removed,who you calling strong fence and that is one what
MMA,not_removed,if he posts the mirror it will be deleted almost instantly ufc are lazy bastards though and dont check the comments
MMA,not_removed,nah he ripped the fence
MMA,not_removed,he kod lawler then he kod that fence
MMA,not_removed,some blatant fence grabbing right there what is worse the ref did nothing to enforce the rules
MMA,not_removed,ooooooooooooo
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,love this lol
MMA,not_removed,yeah same here not my favorite day ever
MMA,not_removed,fuck you rmma
MMA,not_removed,and jj and dc and cruz but still
MMA,not_removed,and joanna champion
MMA,not_removed,and joanna
MMA,not_removed,the best martial artist in the world does not get nearly the respect he deserves
MMA,not_removed,yeah mm is the de facto silva now we had a string of unbeatables but hes probably the only safe bet anymore for a title defense cruz is clean but he gets injured a bit too regularly conor maybe could have held for a bit but going two weight classes upand for some goddamned reason staying thereits annoying that he essentially vacated the division for now that being said i think its important to have that unmovable champion for a bit think of how much the following dominating champions helped the sport have faces we could recognize instead of the revolving doors of late royce silva cro cop wandy hendo hughes gsp jones bj fedor tito chuck carano cyborg rousey faber defended times wec right after defending his kotc belt times as wellthats title defenses in a row had to say that before somebody calls him a gatekeeper he was a legend back in the day cruz ben askren hes not exciting to most but the dude has a long defense aldo and of course mighty mouse forgive me if i forgot anyone
MMA,not_removed,it has been almost two months and the bisping one still somehow surprises me when i see it typed out
MMA,not_removed,dont forget the mcgregor belt
MMA,not_removed,i thought rockhold rda tate and lawler would win for sure this year is the year of the underdogs i guess im a big lawler fan so im really bummed he lost but i dont know im guessing a lot of people it a fluke like the bisping one or im just really underestimating woodley i do feel like if lawler would have got through woodley for the rounds it would have been his by simply tiring him out
MMA,not_removed,and against an absurdly talented and dangerous line of killers prime bj twice prime condit prime hughes times prime diaz etc insane
MMA,not_removed,they said the same thing about robbie maybe finally now people would understand that you just cant count someone out completely in mma ever
MMA,not_removed,tyron is a monster threat for rounds but after that its up in the air would be interested to see him against wonderboy or maia
MMA,not_removed,thats it let the bitterness flow through you
MMA,not_removed,cough mighty mouse johnson
MMA,not_removed,im loving the chaos
MMA,not_removed,we arent too far removed from anderson gsp and jones plus mighty mouse has been dominant forever now and joanna seems to be doing her job as well robbie was on his title defense tonight lots of changing hands this year but lets not act like its been absolute chaos
MMA,not_removed,the tumultous nature of the title picture is good dominant champs generally mean weak divisions look at the best division in mma lightweight no on has been able to hold on to that belt for very long
MMA,not_removed,bring back jon jones edit down votes can commence but he was our most dominant champion
MMA,not_removed,i would personally think wonderboy having more length and striking experience would know how to deal with woodleys range in a way that eliminates the power equation hes fast but wonderboy beat rory with range while did the same to woodley range is the big factor here and wonderboy is a difficult task to close for anyone
MMA,not_removed,it trully only feels like anything and everything can happen to the fighters im hoping to win
MMA,not_removed,my buddy and i bet shots and im one drunk motherfucker right now still got all my cash though yayyy
MMA,not_removed,there was no actionand then the fight was over it was insane
MMA,not_removed,i apparently didnt time my drinking correctly fight was over too quick and now i have to drink watching nothing
MMA,not_removed,i think there is a great silver lining for robbie and the fans in general now would be a perfect time for him to rematch nick diaz thats the biggest money fight available for either and honestly would probably draw way more than robbie vs thompson anyway im more of a diaz fan but its the fight ive wanted for a while their first fight is what made me a fan to begin with even as a big diaz fan though i couldnt justify it with robbie holding the title now i see no reason not to do it
MMA,not_removed,meh im betting he beats wonderboy by complete pressure with a tko but then goes on to possibly lose to maia by sub assuming maia gets through condit
MMA,not_removed,i think they would have killed most mortals tbh
MMA,not_removed,also he had robbie circling to stay away from the cage roy nelsonesque ring awareness
MMA,not_removed,he dropped his left to a simple level change and couldnt react to the right is what i meant literally didnt react might not have been the best wording
MMA,not_removed,well i for one thank them
MMA,not_removed,they are its fucking sad they dont even get to really watch the fight they already have their mouse hovering over the cut video and submit
MMA,not_removed,whats a non believer to a dog
MMA,not_removed,i dont believe in anything after this
MMA,not_removed,who dont believe inmma
MMA,not_removed,whats a god to a non beliber
MMA,not_removed,rumble is smiling down upon woodley from his yoga studio
MMA,not_removed,yeah i know you right no hate to woodley im just a tad salty as a huge lawler fan
MMA,not_removed,fine its like when you put all your points into one branch of special during character creation
MMA,not_removed,hopefully they nerf next patch
MMA,not_removed,osfrog pls
MMA,not_removed,woodleys got that ghetto booty
MMA,not_removed,yeah it seemed like chuck was never the same after the rashad ko sometimes that one big bomb is enough to kill whats left of what used to be an iron chin
MMA,not_removed,rirony
MMA,not_removed,thats pathetic
MMA,not_removed,if someone breaks into mighty mouses house and steals his belt can we count that
MMA,not_removed,i dont think anyone can but i didnt think bisping could really beat luke or woodley could beat robbie but here we are
MMA,not_removed,right this doesnt feel like it had the atmosphere that it shouldve for a champ like robbie finally passing the strap i mean fuck my favorite bar who normally shows all the fights didnt show this one and noone else downtown showed the fights either hardly anyone gave a shit about woodley getting his shot and then boom this happens
MMA,not_removed,he shouldnt be
MMA,not_removed,yep
MMA,not_removed,i dont think he is
MMA,not_removed,late money went on woodley was a few days before but woodley in was
MMA,not_removed,i dunno some crazy shit came out of anderson being ahead of his competition
MMA,not_removed,thats the problem with dj imo hes an insanely likeable guy but his division is full of bums john dodson was the only guy that even came close and he got whupped
MMA,not_removed,can we just forget all about that please
MMA,not_removed,haha that fight was enjoyable from a pure comedy standpoint
MMA,not_removed,unless you are the champion kid then you will die instantly over and over
MMA,not_removed,err remember kids you cant actually fly hes not speaking literally
MMA,not_removed,opens another beer
MMA,not_removed,hey whats up man want half of all of my money forever
MMA,not_removed,was the max theyd allow
MMA,not_removed,you have to click extra bets some fights have like different extra bet criteria its not worth betting on a fight if its just imo
MMA,not_removed,the ko itself wasnt a result of wear and tear but it does cause it lol i think thats what hes referring to
MMA,not_removed,this robbie is still the man
MMA,not_removed,yeah im thinking the only way to really put woodley away is too push the pace stay in his face and tire him out
MMA,not_removed,i think youre right about that punch having nothing to do with the wars but that punch will possibly take his chin away forever at the very least hes going to be more cautious and gun shy so the wars might not happen like they have in the past
MMA,not_removed,ehh i think the wars was a factor i watched the condit vs lawler fight then the gsp vs condit and i did notice lawler ate a lot of shots in a way neither condit nor gsp did fuck my life i love having lawler as the champ and wasnt ready for him to lose to a guy who hasnt fought in so long
MMA,not_removed,nah anyone was going out but after that rip wars
MMA,not_removed,i didnt want lawler to lose the belt this way though
MMA,not_removed,i feel like robbie fights whoever wins between condit and maia and then whoever wins that fights either wonderboy or woodley
MMA,not_removed,it would be their fight
MMA,not_removed,rory is going to belator
MMA,not_removed,ya i think it just seemed quick cause they clinched and right away did nothing ref was probably going by what he was taught if there is no movement for or ten secs or whatever then standsplit them up
MMA,not_removed,that fight is the perfect example of why wonderboy will be the next champ
MMA,not_removed,randleman was such a weird example of someone with incredible physical gifts who could rarely put it together in the ring
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy said on the prefight show that lawler stands and bangs and thats a bad thing against someone with black power lol i doubt he phrased it that way
MMA,not_removed,lol theres no way thats actually what he said
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy mentioned new york after he beat macdonald
MMA,not_removed,i mean hendricks is a good wrestler too pretty sure he beat woodley in the championships in college
MMA,not_removed,yeah one more big win and he can be considered top contender as well
MMA,not_removed,you heard the man lets go
MMA,not_removed,how close were you to that incident you got any info im not sure exactly what happened from my pov it looked like they were fucking with lawler or something it was like a fight youd see in the club right in the middle of robbies entrance
MMA,not_removed,he shall rein as champion until the year when all hell breaks loose
MMA,not_removed,i got fence by first round presher washer
MMA,not_removed,he deserved it its not his fault his contender fight was fucked up because hendricks couldnt make weight
MMA,not_removed,prolly the dude who called him a roided up monkey lmao
MMA,not_removed,which is funny cause robbies suspect hormones are on the front page in plain view showing he was very very likely on something during at least
MMA,not_removed,usada beats timing just kidding really though cheaters never win kids
MMA,not_removed,not sure hes really calling it as much as saying im not surprised motherfuckers
MMA,not_removed,all the postfight gurus always come out after upsets
MMA,not_removed,he got like right up and was like eh that sucked but im cool fucking animal hell be back
MMA,not_removed,each of his past three fights were increasingly savage fucking affairs its amazing that all those brutal title defenses werent sandwiched by longer layoffs too
MMA,not_removed,no its just speed and power landing on the chin none of lawlers recent opponents had that mma and shit happens as a massive lawler fan and massive nick diaz fan stars just aligned for the rematch
MMA,not_removed,so which younger less experienced fighter would have avoidedwalked away from that one
MMA,not_removed,story
MMA,not_removed,what
MMA,not_removed,shhhh
MMA,not_removed,i took woodley masividal ellenberger benoit damien brown and graves most were bullshit bets except on masividal and i put on woodely i had on graves but it got returned because of the draw the other bets i put were just bullshit ones didnt expect to win them on herman rivera and sandivol what fucked my night was losing on rose and i threw a stupid ass spur of the moment bet on the hw fight lol
MMA,not_removed,i expect you to pay me a tithe of on any karma garnered from this comment
MMA,not_removed,cormier hasnt put his belt on the line this year
MMA,not_removed,im still not used to people talking about dominant current champions and jj not meaning jon jones
MMA,not_removed,jj and cruz getting them high scores dc nearly retiring jones via responsibility
MMA,not_removed,realistically how much longer can cruzs knees stay intact dude has had so many injuries no way he is gonna last forever
MMA,not_removed,joanna jyoncherkaosdifajsld
MMA,not_removed,theres a reason shes called joanna champion
MMA,not_removed,such a shame how rockhold didnt care but hell be back to kick ass again
MMA,not_removed,nate diaz is the undisputed mcgregorweight champion
MMA,not_removed,the banterweight belt
MMA,not_removed,and stipe holds the saku belt
MMA,not_removed,maybe other people will understand that its okay to make predictions about fights because thats what we do as fans
MMA,not_removed,serragsp hollyronda bispingrockhold the list goes on and with a power puncher like woodly this outcome wasnt that far fetched
MMA,not_removed,people who counted out woodley are fucking stupid
MMA,not_removed,the story of this fight has always been robbie is better than woodley but can his chin hold up after wars in his last fights the answer was no wonderboy will still destroy woodley the blue print is already there rory completely shut down woodley and wonderboy will do the same but probably even better edit this is getting lit up i concede the fact that shot was good enough to put anyone in the division in trouble youve got me there friends i still stand by the fact that wonderboy is too evasive to get caught by that and he will shut down woodley ala romac ill delete my account if im wrong save this comment until we see the fight were all just throwing shit at a shit pile and calling it brown surprise
MMA,not_removed,mm is by far one of my favorite fighters but he simply doesnt pull the fan fare of old dominant champs like fedor silva gsp etc
MMA,not_removed,dude is tall i literally dont know anyone irl who is that short the competition is just much better at other weight classes because only a really small percentage of people are that little
MMA,not_removed,title changes in months is pretty chaotic tbh
MMA,not_removed,an early break doesnt count as action for you i thought dan breaking the clinch against the fence would hurt woodley guess not
MMA,not_removed,had just opened a beer thinking it was going to go some rounds sat around forcing a beer down because it ended too quick
MMA,not_removed,i went to turn the volume up and it was all over
MMA,not_removed,and yet it fucking works reddit gets me gifs and videos faster than any other site ive been on the magic of the illusory market
MMA,not_removed,theyre like cypher in the matrix i dont even see the fights anymore all i see is comment karma link karma twitter followers
MMA,not_removed,believe in knockouts
MMA,not_removed,is there a yoga joke im missing i dont get it
MMA,not_removed,he shouldve put some character points into unbreakable chin or rapid recovery
MMA,not_removed,well youll always have the marquardt fight that shit was insane
MMA,not_removed,which sportsbook do you use i use bovada but i dont think they have the round by round betting that others do
MMA,not_removed,but that was mostly wow look at how good this dude is and less wow what a crazy fucking war
MMA,not_removed,ian mccall came closer than dodson at though it was only rounds
MMA,not_removed,yes pls
MMA,not_removed,what was the criteria for that he had to kill robbie with one punch
MMA,not_removed,i think if thompson can maintain the distance for a few rounds woodley will tire out
MMA,not_removed,perfect example of why you pressure the power puncher lawler gave woodley plenty of space to set up that right hand
MMA,not_removed,i think the training sessions in hammer house gym were just instructions on how to time your juicing to get max gainz followed by hours of lifting a day
MMA,not_removed,he did though then he raised his fist in solidarity and lowered his shades
MMA,not_removed,lmaooo
MMA,not_removed,can someone give me a link i really do have to see this phrasing
MMA,not_removed,everybody mentioned new york after everything
MMA,not_removed,that new york card is gonna be fucking stacked so many options mcgregoraldo jjkk weidman vs someone i think they could put the welterweight title fight on
MMA,not_removed,lets fucking do this
MMA,not_removed,hendricks was a great wrestler now he seems to be a drifter who has more interest in carbohydrates
MMA,not_removed,hendricks had one good td attempt in that fight before getting koed sure its to wonderboys credit that he got koed so quick bt maybe a longer fight will yield a different result
MMA,not_removed,didnt see the incident itself actually i sat front row entrance side of the octagon lawler looked focused and pissed when he passed me but he always looks that way im in the white shirt in the background when woodley is pounding lawlers face in
MMA,not_removed,he went through the cage at ufc
MMA,not_removed,i dont recall anything happening but when he fought he was like
MMA,not_removed,check the comma placement
MMA,not_removed,rose is great and i love watching her fight but her lack of consistency would never lead me to bet more than on her
MMA,not_removed,even jesus doesnt take hell even the government doesnt take
MMA,not_removed,better get used to it
MMA,not_removed,never lost it
MMA,not_removed,he already got rid of tj so i think he can retire with the belt how many more challengers are even close to his level hes won fights throughout his career a broken man and still showed his technical skill is above all others
MMA,not_removed,i think its joanna juhjuhjuhjuhjuh ski
MMA,not_removed,shes fighting karolina kabalbalbitch next
MMA,not_removed,i always say my predictions leading up to fights like they are fact but i always end up being like fuck what if insert underdog knocks him the fuck out and recently my whatifs have been pretty onpoint
MMA,not_removed,that shot was knocking out any welter weight on the roster
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy is a very different fighter from rory rory pressured woodley up against the cage keeping him at range there with his jab and limited his mobility and power thats not how wonderboy fights now historically an outside fighting karatestylist with good tdd does great against wrestlers but for different reasons
MMA,not_removed,what a ridiculous comment why is that when someone completely defies the odds people like this forget what those odds were to begin with
MMA,not_removed,this fight had nothing to do with robbies chin anyone would have been kod from that punch
MMA,not_removed,how is robbie better if he lost
MMA,not_removed,mma math
MMA,not_removed,how can anyone say that with such confidence with all the defending champions losing in the past few events woodley could destroy wonderboy in the first round just like he did lawler for all we know
MMA,not_removed,comes down to weight vast majority of casuals and big fans alike cant get as hyped about guys they would dwarf in person
MMA,not_removed,its because he hasnt defended against anyone else with a legacy since the division is still new
MMA,not_removed,hopefully one day he will he has title defenses so far
MMA,not_removed,unless youre the ufc who cares hes still puts on great fights and is the most dominant out of all the champs
MMA,not_removed,same with heavyweight and why theres generally only one or two decent guys there the difference is that people like knockouts and when youre a heavy its impossible not to have knockout power
MMA,not_removed,yup thats the main thing and an aspect le rmma hipsters conveniently ignore its much much easier to dominate a division where the talent base is near zero being top at lw is probably harder than being the best ever at in terms of the amount of people you have to go through
MMA,not_removed,usada
MMA,not_removed,yeah as soon as that happened i was like damn that was stupid maybe the best position woodley will get all round and then rip robbie
MMA,not_removed,is it more difficult to drink beer when there isnt a fight on
MMA,not_removed,some girl pissed off rumble so bad he took her yoga mat and threw it across a gym
MMA,not_removed,and sportbet have all the mma prop bets like that all the way down to robbie by fastest sub of the night at i dont think bovada does props for mma
MMA,not_removed,if thats the plan i like woodley the only times i recall woodley getting beatand usually beat upis when he is against the fence woodley comes out last night and immediately backs himself up against the fence which has been his achilles heel lawler has fought more conservatively every fight hes been the champion instead of taking advantage like rory did he let woodley off the cage robbie threw hardly an offensive punch instead he waited on woodley thats how you loose to woodley
MMA,not_removed,if they put the ww title on as well i will crawl up to manchester from london to watch that card
MMA,not_removed,cant fucken wait for weidman vs someone i got my money on weidman but you can never count out someone especially now
MMA,not_removed,i am just disagreeing with the idea that he is fucked all of a sudden because woodley is good wrestler and that he would have done to robbie what he did to hendricks those fighter comparisons dont make sense hendricks is in most ways more similar to woodley than robbie i think
MMA,not_removed,i was in the lower bowl like right across from the incident so i was looking straight at it saw it all but still dont really know what happened shit was crazy got a pic with dwight howard and meisha tate acknowledged my existence so that was pretty cool too haha you meet anyone cool sitting front row
MMA,not_removed,little question is gambling a massive thing in the us its just i used to work in a betting shop in the uk and Â£ singles on a bunch of selections fighters football teams whatever were few and far between bets tended to be much smaller but it looks like here everyone bets like its nothing
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt call it lack of consistency and more an incomplete game with a lot of holes to exploit she is just waaaay overhyped because of her inflated ranking and the hype job during the tuf season i dont say that to hate on her i just think people have unrealistic expectations and the ufc wanted to push her too hard too fast just like pvz i get that people like her and she can be flashy but her game is super exploitable by anyone who can challenge her striking and who is a solid defensive grappler rose has no power in her striking she likes to go for bad sacrifice throws that leave her vulnerable to sweaps and she likes to go for submissions before she secures her advantagous position so as long as you dont get submitted right away chances are you can escape or end up on top
MMA,not_removed,some do
MMA,not_removed,partially his fault remember he pulled outta before jon got kicked off
MMA,not_removed,hahahahaha holy shit
MMA,not_removed,so what youre trying to say is that you got it wrong just like the rest of us
MMA,not_removed,my two predictions were either robbie lawler to win or tyrone woodley to win boldpicks nailedit watchoutvegas
MMA,not_removed,yup it was extremely clean and thrown by probably the most explosive guy in the ufc after rumblehes definitely in the top at least
MMA,not_removed,yeah got nothin to do with robbies chin
MMA,not_removed,maybe condit takes it took a pretty clean one in their fight woodley said something like only condit and roy nelson can take that and not get kod
MMA,not_removed,anyone who cant maintain the distance robbie doesnt mind brawling so that whole timidness in the face of a harder puncher was new to him being timid and distant is what stephen does best
MMA,not_removed,the odds werent stacked against woodley he was an underdog but lawler has seemed one of the most beatable champions for a while this is not revisionist mma history he was down on the cards against rory mcdonald before he stopped him in the many thought he lost on the scorecards against condit
MMA,not_removed,why is that when someone completely defies the odds people like this forget what those odds were to begin with it was robbie woodley before the fight so pretty much even
MMA,not_removed,ive been watching mma for years now and literally every fight i see people saying x will beat y for z reasons and the only thing that has actually remained constant is that every single high level fight is a gamble people said lawler will destroy woodley who has no chance then look what happened people said aldo would destroy connor then look what happened people said nate had no chance against connor and was just a tune up fight for connor while waiting for rda to recover then look what happened people said overeem will destroy travis browne overeem is the greatest striker in the history of the sports a grand prix champion who smashed lesnar there is no way browne can beat him let alone knock him out then look what happened people said lesnar hasnt fought in years and hunt has been walk off koing people left and right brock hates getting hit so hunt is a bad matchup for him lesnar has no chance then look what happened weidman has no chance vs silva and bisping has no chance vs rockhold and on and on and on wrong every time not a single one of you has any idea what you are talking about not one the rate of people being accurate in their analysis is the same as the rate of them being totally wrong so when people here are saying things like conor has no chance against diaz hes gonna get smoked and lawler gets better in later rounds and woodley has no tank so it makes sense for woodley to beat lawler in round but wonderboy will destroy woodley because xyz reason shut the fuck up for real champs are getting dropped left and right overwhelming favorites are getting knocked out round by underdogs and all the analysis in the world isnt helping predict any of these outcomes whether they end up right or wrong so seriously everyone stop doing your mmath and trying to predict shit
MMA,not_removed,woodley is essentially a one trick pony as far as stand up is concerned all he does is overhand right robbie knew that punch was coming he admitted he didnt move like he needed tocircling to the left and backed straight up like a noob wonderboy knows how to avoid a one trick pony
MMA,not_removed,we get it anything can happen in mma that doesnt mean you cant look at fighters and judge how they can use their skillset against another skillset
MMA,not_removed,id say its a mixture of things he has a nice guy personality which doesnt really draw attention usually the size of course but also the highlight reel of koing guys is kind of lacking more in the sense that fans arent just waiting around for that ko i also think the ufc have done a horrible job at promoting him the ufc can sell fans on a lot of things but they really dont shine the spotlight on mm im sure they have their reasons
MMA,not_removed,man i dont know about that id consider myself a casual and my favorite fighter is frankie edgar and im pounds maybe im an outlier but i really dont think stature is the major distinguishing factor its a factor for sure but if a fighter is cool and dominant enough they will draw regardless hell look at conor
MMA,not_removed,its not a weight thing even hardcores barely get excited for dj fights meanwhile dominick cruz is only pounds heavier and theres a vast difference hes just an uninteresting fighter with even less interesting competition thats not to say hes not incredible but he just doesnt have that aura to him that draws people in
MMA,not_removed,and he isnt an averagetolarge shit talker who knocks people out or pokes their eyes
MMA,not_removed,its because he is small thats the only reason people are fucking stupid when they cant appreciate someone as skilled as him
MMA,not_removed,but without that huge fan and ufc push its not really the same mm is in my top favorite fighters but its not the same as watching silva or gsp or even jones and ronda with the whole crowd at their backs and everyone talking about their fights i wish mm could get that status though flyweight is such an exciting weightclass
MMA,not_removed,aaaah now i remember thank you
MMA,not_removed,that open space is exactly where thompson excels too and thompsons kicks have a longer range than woodleys right hand so long as thompson isnt moving to his left or backing up too much i really feel he can wear out woodley over a few rounds and take the decision especially if he commits to the body early no denying woodleys got that marcianohenderson right hand though
MMA,not_removed,yeah actually got introduced before the fights to don house who is one of the og cutmen he then brought over some guys got pics with don assuncao who i already knew because we workout at the same gym bruce buffer and matt hughes got acknowledged by mike brown vin diesel and tyrese sorta and made intimate eye contact with vanessa really would have liked to meet rogan and mccall but still a good night despite me picking every one of my bets wrong
MMA,not_removed,the only ones who talk about their bets are the ones who can afford to drop on fights
MMA,not_removed,neck injury wasnt it thpinal
MMA,not_removed,he was injured and he would have been facing a juiced up jones
MMA,not_removed,you better call tyrone call em
MMA,not_removed,hes on a boat on his way back to kings landing with kaleesi
MMA,not_removed,hes been taking e
MMA,not_removed,what about tyrion
MMA,not_removed,top in blacksplosiveness
MMA,not_removed,yep this exactly robbie is pretty notorious for losing the first round and needing to get hit to get going kind of like old cerrone hes the king of the comeback sure but eventually he was going to go against someone who was going to have killer power we all knew tyron had that was just a question of if he could land it or not and he did its honestly not that surprising to me in hindsight that this upset happened had robbie made it out of the first two rounds he probably crushes tyron but fresh woodley is a scary dude
MMA,not_removed,yeah playing rocky balboa isnt exactly the best strategy to hold onto the belt longterm
MMA,not_removed,its crazy that people will never learn that shit happens in fighting you can breakdown and analyze everything to death and the actual fight can end in a flash because of anything especially at the highest level
MMA,not_removed,reel of koing guys is kind of lacking kod cejudo and benavidez and thats about it you got me there but since taking the title fights ago he has finished of those fights with going to decision that right there is much better that gsps record of almost all decisions
MMA,not_removed,conor and edgar are featherweights conor basically a lightweight thats not small few people will dwarf them those are average guys even more relatable for an average casual mighty mouse is not the biggest guy even in his devision and casuals do dismiss him often just for that
MMA,not_removed,its a little of both tbh i wont ever be convinced that the flyweight division has a talent pool big enough to be considered as competitive as other divisions its a fact their division has less fighters than any other division
MMA,not_removed,people can appreciate his skill but when hes smaller than the average college girl takes away the whole primitive survival of the fittest aspect that people like about mma not to mention that being that small is an outlier in terms of size so there is less competition
MMA,not_removed,he also didnt have a matt hughes or bj penn to dethrone
MMA,not_removed,urijah faber has tons of fans but he fights at and hes only
MMA,not_removed,oh okay get i what youre saying i just think the division is too physically small for people to ever care about it they are fast as hell but most of them are the same height as gymnastics
MMA,not_removed,i broke my thpine
MMA,not_removed,knee injury
MMA,not_removed,and you cant use my phone
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,who is pound for pound best in blacksplosiveness rumble or woodley

MMA,not_removed,what time is this on in the uk
MMA,not_removed,if rampage can make and get back to the ufc would be awesome to see
MMA,not_removed,probably not
MMA,not_removed,jack marshman
MMA,not_removed,thanks i guess
MMA,not_removed,est so gmt i believe
MMA,not_removed,rampage is not rumble
MMA,not_removed,years ago he was
MMA,not_removed,rampage never had that power
MMA,not_removed,rampage was a scary dude in his prime but rumble for sure has a lot better work ethic
MMA,not_removed,rgsp
MMA,not_removed,i love how legit excited brenden is
MMA,not_removed,i bet bryan watches this everyday lol
MMA,not_removed,thatwasnt too shabby
MMA,not_removed,the fighter bryan and the kid brendan
MMA,not_removed,callen vs hall heel kick only
MMA,not_removed,bangkok ready
MMA,not_removed,thats a nice one does anyone have shevchenkos spinning kick in slow mo
MMA,not_removed,master kim would be proud
MMA,not_removed,this will be the first thing he brings up to joe on the next fight companion lol
MMA,not_removed,the most impressive part is how quickly he transitions from taking off the hat to the handshake a master class in smoothness
MMA,not_removed,cant forget drunk joe coaching him on proper kicking
MMA,not_removed,that was actually impressive
MMA,not_removed,brandon
MMA,not_removed,i was expecting a really shitty kick and it was actually good
MMA,not_removed,more tinkerbell than tae kwon do but he hit the target
MMA,not_removed,theyve done companions since this i think
MMA,not_removed,this joke is getting as repetitive as schaub
MMA,not_removed,fuck
MMA,not_removed,schwab
MMA,not_removed,to aid mobile users ill fix gfycat links to spare bandwidth from choppy gifs smaller httpgfycatcompitifulnecessarycougar i am a bot httpsgithubcomdarkmiomassdropredditbot httpswwwredditcomrmassdropbotwikiindexwikibanningabot
MMA,not_removed,first of all cormier has defended his belt second he would have defended his title more recent if jon didnt fuck up
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,cept it was jones fucked up dude went from main event to midcard
MMA,not_removed,dc didnt take fights at hw in the meantime
MMA,not_removed,dumbest shit ever let me know when conor defends a title
MMA,not_removed,man this shit is tired yeah lets just keep pretending theres no difference between being injured and refusing to defend if youre fit to fight and youre not going to fight the belt should rightfully be stripped
MMA,not_removed,dc was going to defend against jones at ufc
MMA,not_removed,pffffft wisdom he was lined for a defense with jones and we know how that went also now he was injured and had tu pull out also he at least has one defense to his belt mcgregor he hasnt even shown any inclination to defend his belt has had no fights lined up to defend it in any shape or form whats his excuse
MMA,not_removed,but it wasnt dcs choice to not defend his belt at ufc anderson silva stepped up and wanted a round fight
MMA,not_removed,where has the goat been the last months when this has been discussed ad nauseum conor never had intentions of returning to after aldo if people think he did then they are blind it was obvious why conor was stripped this tweet is idiotic
MMA,not_removed,if i was barely above a hobo in terms of fighting ability and my friend got me into the ufc id stick up for him too
MMA,not_removed,lol at goat pathetic
MMA,not_removed,they still offered interim fight to anthony johnson but it was turned down
MMA,not_removed,hes not spitting wisdom you muppet dc was set to defend at and jones got pulled
MMA,not_removed,i wasnt aware that jon went to aka and injured dc twice this isnt all jons fault i know its cool to hate jon right now and dc is an internet darling but dc has been lacking in showing up recently i dont think he should be stripped yet but they can feel free to take it if he misses his next booking the lhw division needs to move on that division is slowly dying because rumble has knocked out the entire top and jon is gone theres nothing else to do
MMA,not_removed,ariel nose the truth
MMA,not_removed,he did take on nontitle fight against silva though a similar circumstance to the first diaz fight
MMA,not_removed,i agree plus it wasnt dcs decision to not defend his belt at ufc
MMA,not_removed,lets just keep pretending theres no difference between being injured and refusing to defend ok so when does that excuse finally wear thin aldo fucked up five separate title fights pulling out for injury his challengers just get a too bad so sad at what point are you accountable for signing on the line and not showing up to fight it seems like according to this sub never aldo went longer between a single defense than conor already has
MMA,not_removed,refusing to defend the ufc gave him multiple fight offers and he picked one if they wanted him to defend why not only give him options at
MMA,not_removed,it was more of a sarcasm post you kermit
MMA,not_removed,he is talking about were dc had no opponent days out
MMA,not_removed,fighting rda isnt a defense for the featherweight title
MMA,not_removed,well silva wanted a round fight he wasnt in shape according to him
MMA,not_removed,you mean minus the fact that he wasnt challenging for a title out of his weight class without defending his lhw belt first when jones dropped out
MMA,not_removed,is that his fault he was all set to go rds anyway
MMA,not_removed,he was originally going to fight moussasi for the title before silva stepped in and silva wanted it to be rounds instead of a title fight
MMA,not_removed,you must be some kind of novelty account or something
MMA,not_removed,the ufc doesnt give a shit about that all they care about is what makes them the most money if they thought it were the most lucrative avenue theyd melt all the belts down and make them into a crown for dana
MMA,not_removed,okay and after he lost he should of defended the belt instead of the rematch
MMA,not_removed,and it was a bullshit title shot then too
MMA,not_removed,i dont know how you expect me or anyone to know its sarcasm since we dont know you and theres no hint of it whatsoever but okay
MMA,not_removed,im aware hes also acting like jon is to blame for the title not being defended edit i guess we gonna act like dc hasnt pulled out of of his last bookings since defending the title fucking jon jones man injuring dc and shit
MMA,not_removed,true that if he fought and beat rda at i think his plan was frankie edgar or aldo at the ufc probably had plans for gsp at though
MMA,not_removed,yeah but you said he refused to defend much like the ufc when presented with multiple offers conor picked what was best for him if they only gave him fights at and he said no then thats refusing to defend you cant blame him for taking the best option for himself refusing to defend and not defending are very different things
MMA,not_removed,wellconor did starch the lw champ so its not too ridiculous especially coming after that ko of one of the goats
MMA,not_removed,yet that has nothing to do with the counterpoint raised conor would have challenged for on months notice and could go right to defending both if not for rda thats already twice as quick as the time between a normal aldo defense
MMA,not_removed,i never expected anything you can take the post however youd like haha it really makes no difference to me
MMA,not_removed,he was told if he didnt defend the belt he would be stripped his choice was to take aldo and defend or fight eddie and give up his title
MMA,not_removed,title shots are not earned retroactively you couldve given michael johnson a title shot and theres a good chance he wouldve koed eddie in the first round that wouldnt justify him getting the shot
MMA,not_removed,did rda chose to have conor rematch diaz instead of defending his belt
MMA,not_removed,if its moms house listen to mom
MMA,not_removed,i see youre drinking coors light cause bud light wont pay you nothin
MMA,not_removed,it could be the angle but it looks big enough
MMA,not_removed,can it hold your weight
MMA,not_removed,jump up and grab it id say it would though
MMA,not_removed,gonna say no it would hold it but the wear of hitting the back repeatedly will eventually mess it up
MMA,not_removed,from someone who has done this dont do it the gigantic drillhole will forever be an eyesore long after you leave moms house
MMA,not_removed,hang it near the end of the span within two feet or so and youll be okay dont hang it from the center of the span because math
MMA,not_removed,looks like it i had a lbs hanging from a half cracked half rotten for years with a heavy chain and it held
MMA,not_removed,holds me up perfectly fine and i could just take it down after uses so it wont sit up there all day if that helps at all
MMA,not_removed,pergola is not weight
MMA,not_removed,also connected to large support beams
MMA,not_removed,i would be amazed if that wasnt able to hold a bag amazed
MMA,not_removed,listen to your mom not all no need to be structurally correct she maybe doesnt want the noise and view of a punchingbag
MMA,not_removed,why ask rmma seriously this sub is one of the lowest iq subs in reddit im always disappointed by how stupid and slow everyone is on here myself included why not ask raskengineers or a home improvement sub where contractors are likely to browse
MMA,not_removed,hang it in your room in the basement
MMA,not_removed,do a pullup on it if it holds it holds
MMA,not_removed,my mother laughed at this
MMA,not_removed,nobody goes there anyways and the location is fine for mom just doesnt know if it can hold
MMA,not_removed,you say that you will take it down after use but as someone who has had a punching bag you wont put it up and down after every use so find a place your mom is cool with you leaving it up or dont put it up because it will sit in the garage and rarely get used because putting it up is a hassle
MMA,not_removed,not smart huhmy gpa at devry says otherwise
MMA,not_removed,my moms mother laughed at this
MMA,not_removed,call in helwani
MMA,not_removed,she had split decision dissents scoring a fight for the loser of a split decision in almost years from january to september since december she already has source
MMA,not_removed,i went through all the split decisions on mma decisions where she was the dissenting judge and noted down the fight winner who she picked as winner and their perceived race by me see disclaimer yearfight winnerperceived racebyrd winnerperceived race disclaimer obviously race identification is a controversial and somewhat nebulous process but i thought it might be useful to just put down what i thought each fighters race was in a casual way based only on their names and pictures i assume thats generally all a judge would have to go on and im guessing my perceptions would line up pretty well with the average americans so i think its a solid reference standard if were talking about an individuals instinctive racial bias which we are the only ones where i wasnt really confident were clay guida and dustin ortiz not sure if either is white or hispanic anyway its not a huge sample size but i have to say it doesnt look like the least biased data ever in decisions where byrd dissented the hispanic fighter never lost and a white fighter never won against a nonwhite fighter the rule hispanic black other would correctly predict byrds decision in all of these fights
MMA,not_removed,she also was one of the judges who gave garcia the w over phan i think shes just stupid
MMA,not_removed,wow gave anderson vs tom lawlor anderson won but didnt win round one wtf also was the split in larkin vs tumenov i dont know jury still out for me but i didnt even look into boxing her mma record is pretty bad but then again i think weeks is even worse edit holy shit she was the one who did give nover vs tukhugov the split when everyone else on planet had it for zubairia tukhugov vs nover she somehow gave nover two rounds that is some next lvl wtf edit the more you look into it its pretty fucking clear this girl has some serious bias this speaks volumes in decisions where byrd dissented the hispanic fighter never lost and a white fighter never won against a nonwhite fighter the rule hispanic black other would correctly predict byrds decision in all of these fights
MMA,not_removed,i was gonna post about this idiot last night i held my breath in round hoping aljo would pull it out but he def lost the last she was also the lone dissenting judge on a later fight but i forget which she is consistently awful yet no repercussions
MMA,not_removed,referees should be judges former fighters should be judges anyone but these people should be itd mind boggling how they even get them in the first place
MMA,not_removed,first thing that popped into my head reading this was whether she was the judge that went in the corey andersontom lawlor fight when anderson in no way won the first round its definitely indicative of a larger pattern and whether that pattern is racism or sheer incompetence it aint a good one
MMA,not_removed,i just think shes a horrible judge has no idea how to score ground heavy matches and is useless in a close fight im tired of boxing judges being considered capable mma judges
MMA,not_removed,wait wasnt she the dissenting judge on the same card scoring in favor of jorge masvidal cuban peruvian over lorenz larkin african american
MMA,not_removed,im too lazy to check but here are her stats
MMA,not_removed,what a byrd brain
MMA,not_removed,i want to believe its just incompetence
MMA,not_removed,she is well known as a racist in the boxing world as well
MMA,not_removed,racist or not shes clearly an awful judge not that the judging is great to begin with replacing her would be a small but positive step for mma judging
MMA,not_removed,spike leeesque is adelaide byrd in her prejudice joe
MMA,not_removed,boxing difficult fights to judge with majority adelaide byrd world average mma difficult fights to judge with majority adelaide byrd world average with easy fights to judge shes above average with the majority in both mma and boxing
MMA,not_removed,the ufc was able to get rid of mazzaggati hopefully they can do the same for this bitch how anyone can score that fight for sterling is beyond me
MMA,not_removed,if this gets bigger shes going to over compensate and give the next decision to the white guy even if the minority dominates
MMA,not_removed,she is at the very least incompetent on almost every card she has ever judged she is the only one in favor of a loosing opponent now with that said her tendency to choose black fighters over their opponents is almost undeniable this conversation is incredibly necessary although it is probably wishful thinking to hope the dialogue will continue and not just with this judge but all of them judges need to be brought to the light we need to know which ones are incompetent and which ones are honest and have a good understanding of combat
MMA,not_removed,we need more of the facts since you brought it up and im too lazy please give more examples
MMA,not_removed,but she have an history of always scoring for the black fighter not true of all her dissenting split decisions going back to she has scored it for the black fighter a total of times b caraway def a sterling z bunnell def j roman a tumenov def l larkin j varner def m guillard there are three dissenting decisions where she scored the fight against the black fighter in fact one of them was the lorenz larkinjorge masvidal fight from last night at this point this is not a baseless accusation thats exactly what this is and its embarrassing to see it upvoted
MMA,not_removed,we need jake shields to investigate
MMA,not_removed,she is a long time boxing judge that transitioned to also judging mma i would not be surprised if she didnt have as deep an understanding of mma as she does boxing
MMA,not_removed,how come every time black people do something perceived as racist some white people act like their actions justfiy their prejudices if this woman is actually racist thats extremely terrible and she should never be able to judge again but all of the sarcastic black people cant be racist comments are unnecessary i thought this subreddit was above all of the subtle andor blatant racism thats frequent on this site seeing as though theres so many different cultural backgrounds in this sport but i guess i was wrong
MMA,not_removed,her husband is usually a decent boxing ref
MMA,not_removed,this is messed up and definitely happens in the other direction as well though
MMA,not_removed,theres been talk of byrds racial bias in boxing for years
MMA,not_removed,after reading all of the facts i dont think shes racist i think shes just a bad judge which isnt surprising we have a lot of bad judges
MMA,not_removed,she was the odd one out in the larkinmasvidal fight but scored it for jorge not larkin is this an exception edit the ufc fight you mentioned was between tumenov and larkin and although she scored it for larkin that fight was a tossup on the scorecards in fact i had it for larkin after three rounds
MMA,not_removed,it seems like at least from the examples op and others have given she might have a bias against grappling which would make sense if shes a former boxing judge she just might not score grappling as highly as other judges especially since others have pointed out that she doesnt always vote against white guys
MMA,not_removed,she might be racist but shes definitely not a good judge some of her scores are just ridiculous
MMA,not_removed,i hope this isnt true
MMA,not_removed,really serious accusations to not substantiate properly hopefully someone more capable can take the torch from here
MMA,not_removed,i think shes just a bad judge
MMA,not_removed,great to see a post that is calling out racism in favor of black people getting upvoted its frustrating to see the public only see racism when it impacts black people negatively when the reverse is also very much prevalent
MMA,not_removed,boxing fan here adelaide byrd has a long history of being a racist judge in boxing too not surprised at all that this piece of shit is doing the same in mma
MMA,not_removed,shes a bad judge shes not the only one leaving this thread up will prove to be a bad idea
MMA,not_removed,never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance
MMA,not_removed,i was really expecting a bunch of nonsense when i saw this thread title but this has credibility i hope this gets picked up by media at the very least racist or not shes shown clear incompetence and shouldnt be judging
MMA,not_removed,byrd is a bad judge who makes bad calls on the reg she doesnt have some ulterior motives to score the fights in favor of the minority fighter though jesus christ as a non white male living in the states its bullshit that even on my favorite sub we start to see this race bullshit creep in if byrd was a white judge and scored some questionable calls for white fighters fucking op wouldnt have even noticed it nothing to see here just incompetence and some unfortunate coincidences dont sticky this shit post
MMA,not_removed,the op has made comments saying that immigrants commit genocide and muslims should be charged with treason know who youre involved with people
MMA,not_removed,in bjj its common for blue gis to rack up more points maybe its an optical illusion thing
MMA,not_removed,adalaide byrd
MMA,not_removed,as soon as i heard buffer say her name it explained the bad call im not sure if im with the idea that racism is behind her poor decisions but i dont know what else to suggest shes just terrible
MMA,not_removed,she needs a walk of atonement
MMA,not_removed,im color blindcan i have her job
MMA,not_removed,how do you even become a judge and why are incompetent people regularly chosen
MMA,not_removed,aljamain got the first round easy but lost the next two pretty convincingly even his face showed it at the end usually when i see atrocious scoring in fights first thing i think is bank accounts not racism quick google search of adelaides name shows this isnt a isolated incident of bad judging whether she holds a bias towards other ethnic groups or not she is a shitty judge and should be fired regardless
MMA,not_removed,boxrec lists every judges fights
MMA,not_removed,i forsee a can of worms exploding
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,but is she still better than cecil peoples
MMA,not_removed,who wins dc or jones who the blackest will she always award manhoef the victory that dude is dark as space
MMA,not_removed,shes bad stupid and doesnt see fights but racist no i dont think so she scores a lot of her fights badly just remember shes no cecil peoples
MMA,not_removed,upvoted how is she still allowed to do this shit
MMA,not_removed,maybe she does not value take downs as highly as you do but im curious if you think she is racist op what are you going to do about it
MMA,not_removed,if a white judge was called a racist this thread would be taken down so fast our fuckin heads would spin
MMA,not_removed,i hate being the too busy to help out person but if you really want something to happen or get down to the bottom of this you need to compile all her fights with black fighters and put the stats in tables also notify in cases where she was against other judges and not notify when she was in line
MMA,not_removed,is there an easy way or website to look at judges or the worst decisions so far
MMA,not_removed,then its a good thing three judges make the decision and not just one
MMA,not_removed,she is likely being paid i hate to say that but it is naive to think that this is not the case prizefighting brings with it cheating from matchfixing to crooked judges she might also be racist but it is far more likely that she is in the pocket of a crime syndicate
MMA,not_removed,idk if shes necessarily racist but she is definitely clueless when it comes to judging fights
MMA,not_removed,this doesnt have anything to do with racism by looking at her record in judging you can see she doesnt always favor the black fighter in fact the amount of times are very minimal and sometimes shes favored a fighter that is not black
MMA,not_removed,how about instead of calling her racist we call her biased she is certainly biased and even if her bias is race based it still does not make her a racist that is still just bias biases are inevitable and a good judge needs to recognize them and make a conscious effort to compensate for them the way a fight is perceived is different depending on who the viewer wants to win or believes is better race accusations aside when a judge scores a round in a way that no one else on earth that watched the same fight can comprehend it is a problem and the judge should be removed the time it happens at most it has happened several times with her
MMA,not_removed,oh this is in favour of black people i guess that explains why this is so upvoted
MMA,not_removed,dude black people cant be racist duh s
MMA,not_removed,if you are prepared to publicly call someone stuff like that you should also be prepared to actually back your statement up saying she always does is not backing it up so what were some of the fights that show without a doubt that she is biased in her judging
MMA,not_removed,bbc strikes again
MMA,not_removed,whether byrd is actually racist corrupt or just incompetent the motivations of the op are hugely suspect someone who rants about racial interbreeding immigrants committing genocide in europe and calls people who disagree with mass deportation of muslims traitors is not someone id trust to have an unbiased judgement on what is and isnt racist behavior im not saying byrd isnt racist for all i know she is but this guy definitely really wants her to be racist
MMA,not_removed,didnt you know you calling a black person racist is racist
MMA,not_removed,you explain stupidity with stupidity okay nice job ð
MMA,not_removed,how the hell do these people even get to be mma judges thats it im starting a grassroots lavaenema for ufc judge campaign and hashtag on twitter i promise you guys ill only be pretty wasted for the events so theres no way im doing a worse job than these clowns
MMA,not_removed,fights should not be decided by judges knockout submission or draw
MMA,not_removed,you mean shes politically correct in todays culture
MMA,not_removed,i dont even get why they have people like her judging mma when she probably knows very little to almost nothing about the sport
MMA,not_removed,its just amazing how she is still employed as a judge there is about zero accountability within the acs when it comes to judging
MMA,not_removed,adlaide byrd aka mmas version of cj ross
MMA,not_removed,worse than cj ross
MMA,not_removed,as a black guy i literally cant believe some of the shit i am reading in the comments here as a comment below showed by pointing out her dissenting sds against black fighters this is literally a baseless accusation yes she is a dumbass and probably shouldnt be judging but this post just seems to have provided an outlet for people to feel safe to express some very toxic attitudes about race i am presuming that most of it is coming from white redditors on rmma who with all due respect will never experience racism in the same way that a minority living in a majority white westernized country will
MMA,not_removed,but black people cant be racist s
MMA,not_removed,well considering shes a mixed white woman married to a black man i wouldnt be surprised shes probably into that whole black power mindset
MMA,not_removed,hes busy stunt double for adrian brody
MMA,not_removed,yeah so we can hear more hearsay reporting on this hearsay accusation stupid accusation by op
MMA,not_removed,could be money involved id believe that over racism
MMA,not_removed,lol at the very least she is a terrible judge and needs to be removed solely on that basis at the very least
MMA,not_removed,i think theres clearly a pattern here to raise eyebrows but not enough to properly say one way or another it would be interesting to expand it to include decisions she was right with but number of rounds awarded that was different to other judges for example did she award hispanic fighter a when other two awarded that would increase the data with equally relevant data and would potentiality rule out bribery since her decision would not decide the fight it would also be interesting to see split decisions she is on the right side of to see the chance of a minority fighter winning compared to average im not saying you should do all this but it would be an interesting freakonomics podcast episode
MMA,not_removed,youve got a really serious selection bias in your sample by removing all of the successes from the sample how her scorecards look when she is not a dissenter is also important if we want to find a pattern in her behavior besides that this sample size is really small and spread over a really long time i agree with others calling this a witch hunt the evidence is extremely unconvincing
MMA,not_removed,boxing here are some more of her sds with her being the only cause of split carlos molina hispanic ishe smith black ibf world super welterweight title judges barry druxman burt a clements adalaide byrd bernard hopkins black joe calzaghe white judges ted gimza chuck giampa adalaide byrd vonda ward white martha salazar hispanic judges richard houck cj ross adalaide byrd probably a lot more would be really interesting to get her cards on all the ones not decided by decision
MMA,not_removed,its really fucking clear theres a bias if these fights were a coin flip she wouldnt hit the same pattern times in a row if you looked at the statistics and odds of this happening where fighters are picked by chance it would be close to nil but it isnt by chance its human choice against overwhelming evidence
MMA,not_removed,does she judge any boxing fights
MMA,not_removed,thanks for posting this im not sure if i see minorityfavoring judging just confused if not bad judging
MMA,not_removed,wtf thats serious
MMA,not_removed,i went through all the split decisions on mma decisions where she was the dissenting judge this is asinine you chose a pointlessly narrow selection criteria and got bs data as a result she has decisions total and your analysis involves fewer than of them
MMA,not_removed,masvidal was robbed wasnt the first time doubt it will be the last time
MMA,not_removed,never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity
MMA,not_removed,but even if its stupidity and not bias she still deserve to be fired
MMA,not_removed,does she have any signficant credentials
MMA,not_removed,i think youre right she was the only judge to give mas the decision over larkin last night so that pokes a hole in the racist theory more likely shes just another incompetent judge
MMA,not_removed,um the black community sometimes doesnt like asians
MMA,not_removed,phillipe nover is one of my best friends and i was totally surprised it was a split decision i really felt it should have been a unanimous decision win for tukhugov
MMA,not_removed,i actually had it lawlor but the first round is completely not debatable
MMA,not_removed,i had larkin winning as well v tumenov that was a deserved split ill say but point still valid
MMA,not_removed,in her most controversial judgement she prefaces the winning fighters name as it was a cuban fighter the other fighter is just by their name brandon rÃ­os the op is gonna love this edit when i say the winning fighter i mean in her controversial scoring
MMA,not_removed,interestingly she refuses to give rounds she doesnt believe in it and hasnt given one in over years reason enough she should be excused from judging
MMA,not_removed,her other bout as the dissenting judge was masvidal
MMA,not_removed,when did you become a mod congrats
MMA,not_removed,throw up a spoiler alert please some of us havent gotten round to the early prelims yet
MMA,not_removed,what happened who removed it
MMA,not_removed,whats funny is if you look through ops submission history hes clearly a racist himself
MMA,not_removed,it poses some good points like what exactly definitely promotes discussion any idiot can make a claim that promotes discussion whether that discussion is remotely useful or even sensical is another matter
MMA,not_removed,this shouldnt stay up its bullshit that op pulled out of his ass edit ok fine if mods feel this is creating a discussion i agree with that but my disagreement is mainly over op picking a few examples and claiming them as absolute proof of his opinion
MMA,not_removed,dont sticky this
MMA,not_removed,yeah theres some real valuable mma debate going on right now s
MMA,not_removed,whether that pattern is racism or sheer incompetence those two tend to go hand in hand
MMA,not_removed,good call that was her
MMA,not_removed,shes not a good boxing judge either
MMA,not_removed,from what i found by split decisions she was a part of she seemed to prefer minorities and if it was between two different races of minorities she preferred the hispanic
MMA,not_removed,she dont like what lorenz does with his hair
MMA,not_removed,theres another counterexample when she was the dissenting judge voting in favor of nonblack fighter edgar garcia over a black fighter brad blackburn or examples from something like fights scored isnt evidence of jack shit even if there hadnt been any counterexamples this post is witch hunting trash the mod comment up top is fucking embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,me too but its not a good excuse tbh
MMA,not_removed,instances out of over fights is literally nothing statistically insignificant this is a pandering bullllshit post
MMA,not_removed,agreed thats the biggest part she is doing a terrible job and should be fired either way
MMA,not_removed,oh give it a rest already
MMA,not_removed,isnt the accusation for fights of color vs noncolor though not difficulteasy fights to judge
MMA,not_removed,this should be higher up
MMA,not_removed,really mazzaggati is no longer a ref ive been wondering what happened with him
MMA,not_removed,she scored the first round of silva weidman in favor of silva the only of the judges that did that two of the three judges who scored the fight for the year old calzaghe who is referred to as the prince of wales were white and their tallies were enough to overcome the scorecard of adalaide byrd who is black judge ted gimza scored it for calzaghe while chuck giampa had calzaghe winner by an even bigger margin boxingcommentator paulie malignaggi called out judge adalaide byrd for her score in favor of austin trout and this only off the top of my heads the stupidly ridiculous ones would be easy to look for more
MMA,not_removed,why didnt you post the dissenting decisions where she scored the fight against a black fighter because theres another pattern the three fighters she scored for are all hispanic fighters which doesnt prove her black white bias wrong at all and honestly how do you explain the decisions so you think shes just an absolutely incompetent moron who has completely misjudged a ton of fights this year and the fact that fights have a clear pattern is pure coincidence you realize if she picked a fighter based on a coin flip shed have less than one percent chance of having a pattern like that right but its not by chance shes actively going against clear majority decisions to pick the minority fighter over a white fighter and a hispanic fighter over other minorities anyone remember garcia over kz having it happen this much isnt random incompetence i think its pretty bizarre to act like theres not some sort of bias going on
MMA,not_removed,her boxing judging doesnt seem much better tho not saying shes racist just terrible at judging
MMA,not_removed,this sub has never not had issues it avoided the direct black v white racism that infects a lot of the internet but look at the way people talk about brazilian fighters its not racist if its a countryculture some will cry okay good for you find another word ethnocentrism xenophobia i dont care
MMA,not_removed,its definitely not as bad but with the recent influx of shit fans due to the sports rising popularity it was bound to attract these shit heads
MMA,not_removed,do we really need to start this shit here she is a bad judge and possibly a racist complain to authorities lets get her fired but lets not go down this retarded route if you guys start circlejerking about black people cant be racist and she is there for the quota you will turn lot of people off and authorities will see this as some witchhunt on a black woman but then again when was reddit ever smart in getting things done
MMA,not_removed,black people can certainly be bigoted but racism implies power and influence since blacks by and large are powerless they most certainly cannot be racist in a way that influences our daily lives
MMA,not_removed,at best they are an idiot at worst they are racist either way fuck um
MMA,not_removed,but she also has the reputation of favoring black fighters in boxing too i dont think two fanbases of distinct sports would come to the same conclusion if there wasnt at least a questionable pattern in her scoring history
MMA,not_removed,yeah letÂ´s just assume thereÂ´s no racist intent like we always do
MMA,not_removed,so byrd isnt racially biased and the op noticed those questionable results because the op is racist
MMA,not_removed,first you dont know that op wouldnt notice racism going in another direction maybe but why should you be defensive in this instance why cant we all disavow anyone that is racist regardless of who is affected and what race we each are she is so terrible and some of her decisions are so off base that people are bound to try and pinpoint what her bias is because its existence is undeniable we should all want for her to never judge another fight again above all else we should be united in that
MMA,not_removed,agree this is race baiting
MMA,not_removed,in honesty my first assumption was that she was white ruling in favour of white i was surprised to see the other case but then i am a white male with a different perspective
MMA,not_removed,oh stop it we want to see shit like this regardless of race fair is fair and right is right any judge that seems sketchy should get blown the fuck up let the court of public opinion decide
MMA,not_removed,moon door
MMA,not_removed,everyone knows judging is total bullshit this isnt the only example its already wide spread news
MMA,not_removed,not true i havent clicked on any links and have no clue if shes white black brown whatever
MMA,not_removed,actually i was wrong its hispanicblackwhite
MMA,not_removed,its true they can only have cultural biases which were in fact taught to them by the white oppressors so even if directed at like say a chinese person for no other reason than race it is still not racism youlearnedtoday uhuru
MMA,not_removed,read the whole thread i posted more fights to someone else and other ppl also provided examples
MMA,not_removed,i just tweeted it edit wow try to help a person out get downvoted k trueee
MMA,not_removed,you have my vote
MMA,not_removed,i am presuming that most of it is coming from white redditors on rmma who with all due respect will never experience racism in the same way that a minority living in a majority white westernized country will what you wrote didnt bug me until this quote with respect to you as well this is exhausting to hear reddits makeup is a majority of males reddits not just a bunch of white privileged males any more than rblackpeopletwitter is all black people
MMA,not_removed,god forbid people discuss the possibility of having a racist judge im sure if this was a white judges discriminating against someone else your response would be different
MMA,not_removed,why did she decide latino fighters over black fighters then
MMA,not_removed,says the guy on the keyboard
MMA,not_removed,he smells crime and runs around on all fours like a hound
MMA,not_removed,i love that nose it all
MMA,not_removed,best reddit mma comment ever he is canadian even and i cant even stand the guy enough to listen to him long enough to see if he is any good
MMA,not_removed,so you saying helwani doesnt want to stick his nose into this story
MMA,not_removed,the scorecards are documented as are the comparisons to those of other judges there is zero hearsay in the accusation
MMA,not_removed,thats the biggest joke about athletic commissions i trust the ufc to judge fights more than the nsac
MMA,not_removed,yeah its not a good look either way could also just not be educated in mma scoring seems like theres a lot of judges that come from either boxing or grappling and judge accordingly
MMA,not_removed,really we would need the average percentage of a judge being the dissenting judge in a split decision going on the data posted above she doesnt appear to have a racial bias
MMA,not_removed,agree it would be fascinating to see that sort of analysis ideally for all judges and lots of different potential biases its a real shame scores arent generally released for fights that get finished too a lot of great data were missing out on
MMA,not_removed,i think theres clearly a pattern here to raise eyebrows but not enough to properly say one way or another this is a statistical question too â how much does this deviate from the norm how much power does the sample size have etc
MMA,not_removed,yeah im with you its easy to pluck out all of the outliers and call it a pattern
MMA,not_removed,i think theres clearly a pattern here yes incompetence
MMA,not_removed,if the issue was presented intelligently i too would like discrimination in the mma judging process the be explored
MMA,not_removed,youve got a really serious selection bias in your sample just on a point of order selection bias is a particular thing in statistics its not a selection bias if the data is in fact the actual data and i have no reason to doubt that it is the next step would have to be done which is to establish the significance of this data which involves gathering the data on the number of fights in question the races of all fighters etc if conclusions were drawn with this data that would be totally wrong and would be cherry picking without the rest of the statistical process we cant say either way what the data suggests
MMA,not_removed,stop trying to use liberal media data and reason op is a trump supporter clearly there is an epidemic of judges in america being racist towards whites
MMA,not_removed,absolutely correct typical online lynch mob being very selective and ignorant with data she doesnt know what the other judges are scoring so this makes it very important
MMA,not_removed,she hit the pattern times out of over years
MMA,not_removed,but it still doesnt show a bias of race shes not racist just a very incompetent judge
MMA,not_removed,also on the ortiz vs scoggins she favored scoggins but on his list he listed both of them as white so that someone who isnt paying attention doesnt notice she favored the white fighter over the hispanic fighter but on the other fighters with hispanic last names he does have them listed as hispanic and not white
MMA,not_removed,he chose of the fights where she dissented and found that a very basic rule could apply to all the fights she dissented on hispanicsblacksothers slowly digging into her other fights it looks like she has made many other questionable decisions she had a history of doing this in boxing as well
MMA,not_removed,its clearly not a pointless criterion
MMA,not_removed,racists usually are stupid
MMA,not_removed,yes but apathy is the glove into which evil slips its hand
MMA,not_removed,when did this saying become a law of nature there is no basis for it its just some trope parroted around by people trying to be deep
MMA,not_removed,can you fire someone whos essentially a volunteer
MMA,not_removed,just checked her out over on mmadecisions after checking out other judges in the ufc thats not okay seems like she has been off her meds the past months
MMA,not_removed,shes a mother the hardest job of all s
MMA,not_removed,need a woman in the work place even if shes not qualified
MMA,not_removed,well shes married to robert byrd a referee in the world boxing hall of fame for his work in that sport
MMA,not_removed,her husband is robert byrd a longtime referee in boxing i think hes the reason shes become a judge
MMA,not_removed,married to hof boxing ref robert byrd
MMA,not_removed,are you soca bjj
MMA,not_removed,ty for being honest i like nover a lot but yeah i dont see how you can give two rounds to him
MMA,not_removed,that to me is the biggest wtf round maybe ive ever seen
MMA,not_removed,adding my hat to the pile of having larkin winning them spinning leg kicks
MMA,not_removed,current circlejerk aside i think most people here had larkin winning
MMA,not_removed,youre getting downvoted bit i had larkin as well
MMA,not_removed,i was at that fight live and had on tumenov that one was truly and i wasnt going to be surprised if either won even a draw wouldve made sense
MMA,not_removed,havent rewatched but i try to be fair on judges who only watch it once and then have to score i picked larkin over tumenov in my first viewing as well
MMA,not_removed,when was the last time anybody scored a round
MMA,not_removed,thanks d maybe about weeks ago or a month we got a handful of new mods to deal with the shitposts
MMA,not_removed,congrats for becoming a mod is like congrats for cleaning up shit from infants at a clinic without pay
MMA,not_removed,spoiler alert applied apologies
MMA,not_removed,get out of rmma then
MMA,not_removed,it devolved into a complete shit fest and the evidence pretty much showed there was not enough proof so we decided to delete it in retrospect we probably shouldve deleted it initially too
MMA,not_removed,where is your proof that this is bullshit if you have none then please move on with your nonsense
MMA,not_removed,its because shes hispanic
MMA,not_removed,granted op made a poor case of it by singling it out as benefitting black fighters but refer to and realize your witch hunting accusation is unfair there is a pattern and it doesnt need to constitute a majority of her scores in order to be significant the mod noted they were leaving it up despite the reports because it was sparking healthy debate theres people agreeing with op and then theres people disagreeing with op such as yourself both sides with good visibility especially the comment which i linked above which is neutral the difference is your side is the only of the two which apparently wants to apply censorship he didnt sticky the thread calm down and read his comment again
MMA,not_removed,the mod comment that affirms that we have the ability to freely discuss a subject is embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,the mod was referring to the fact that the reports were enough to take it down its fostering discussion so he decided to leave it up so were damned if we take stuff down and damned if we leave it up for the sake of good discussion
MMA,not_removed,i think the accusation is that hispanics as edgar garcia is are given decisions over blacks and that blacks and hispanics both are given decisions over whites
MMA,not_removed,which fight was it that she preferred a white fighter over a minority
MMA,not_removed,edgar garcia is hispanic the top of her judging totem pole if you look at her history
MMA,not_removed,or examples from something like fights scored isnt evidence of jack shit even if there hadnt been any counterexamples this post is witch hunting trash thank you
MMA,not_removed,how did you arrive at that number
MMA,not_removed,another user posted this fight carlos molina hispanic ishe smith black ibf world super welterweight title judges barry druxman burt a clements adalaide byrd fight bernard hopkins black joe calzaghe white judges ted gimza chuck giampa adalaide byrd fight vonda ward white martha salazar hispanic judges richard houck cj ross adalaide byrd its very strange to me that a boxing judge can just transition to mma without any background if shes not explicitly racist in her decisions which idk she seems to do a poor job at evaluating the fights
MMA,not_removed,i think the point is that difficult to judge fights are where you will see a bias emerge if anywhere
MMA,not_removed,why statistics have no place in a racism witch hunt
MMA,not_removed,hes still a ref just not in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,she scored the first round of silva weidman in favor of silva the only of the judges that did that wow that round was definitely weidmans
MMA,not_removed,wow thats a bad one weidman was doing some serious damage from top control and definitely won that round anderson didnt land hardly anything even when he was doing his clowning bit on weidman
MMA,not_removed,quotas are real there are many institutions that are putting minorities into spots based on their racial standing
MMA,not_removed,she has the power to influence the outcome of the fight
MMA,not_removed,since blacks by and large are powerless except for that dude in the white house
MMA,not_removed,you cant just change the definition of a word to justify your antiwhite bias seems very much like youre attacking white people with the same accusation of cabalist conspiring that antisemites use to attack jews
MMA,not_removed,since blacks by and large are powerless they most certainly cannot be racist in a way that influences our daily lives not sure if its trolling or sarcasm
MMA,not_removed,racism implies power and influence no matter how many times you tack this on its never going to change the real definition give the game up its never going to work
MMA,not_removed,so let me get this straight youre saying one of judges of a fight has no power or influence over the results of the fight and consequently the careers and future finances of the two people fighting all because shes black and not white i missed the part where they said the white judges scored it and then the black judge scored it but keep in mind this doesnt count because shes black youre either trolling or retarded
MMA,not_removed,except that in this case she is in a position of power of determining one of the biggest decision of fighters lives
MMA,not_removed,you cant just change the definition of a word to justify your antiwhite bias seems very much like youre attacking white people with the same accusation of cabalist conspiring that antisemites use to attack jews
MMA,not_removed,which one of these definitions suits someone who discriminates based on race racist a person who believes in racism the doctrine that ones own racial group is superior or that a particular racial group is inferior to the others bigoted obstinately or unreasonably attached to a belief opinion or faction and intolerant towards other peoples beliefs and practices i dont understand the point of warping the definition please enlighten me btw you sound like a rich white kid that means well but doesnt live in the real world black people dont have power or influence in our daily lives for real dude
MMA,not_removed,holy shit you are a liberal lol
MMA,not_removed,black people can certainly be bigoted but racism implies power and influence no it actually doesnt thats completely madeup to make you feel better about being racist if i were bigoted towards black people i would be racist my people have near zero influence in the us and we can still be called racist
MMA,not_removed,youre why america needs trump
MMA,not_removed,ive started to see this argument pop up you cant be racistsexist unless you have power influence stupidest shit ive heard in my life
MMA,not_removed,thats the academic version of the definition but not the one everyday people use
MMA,not_removed,i dont think two fanbases of distinct sports would come to the same conclusion if there wasnt at least a questionable pattern in her scoring history are boxing and mma fans on different islands or maybe attitudes in one seep into others she may be racistbut theres a pretty big flaw in well some groups of people agree theres a reason investigations and legal systems dont necessarily work that way
MMA,not_removed,yea that line of logic is amazing
MMA,not_removed,he has selective evidence and barely any at that
MMA,not_removed,i can pick questionable decisions of a judge who has judged a hundred fights and claim hes racist too thats exactly what op did out of hundreds of fights he picks a handful and calls it incontrovertible proof that shes racist
MMA,not_removed,they definitely do shadow the accusation of racism not the decisions themselves if it was someone who had a great interest in analyzing the decisions of judges and had spent time looking into their scoring records and this was just one judge out of many they had commented on then the charge of racism might be more credible the fact that this is someone who regularly posts extreme racist views just happens to have found evidence of a judge who appears to be racist against whites is coincidental to say the least confirmation bias is incredibly powerful if you pick something you want to be true you can always find something to back it up with if your main aim is proving what you want to be true rather than honestly assessing what is true theres plenty of nonracist explanations possible before you jump to racist shes primarily a boxing judge so if black fighters are more likely to box or white fighters are more likely to grapple then theres a inherent racial bias that has nothing to do with her being a racist or not
MMA,not_removed,mm
MMA,not_removed,youre not helping
MMA,not_removed,read the whole thread you posted one fight that someone else mentioned the other examples i see here show me that shes probably incompetent im not going to waste my time looking for posts buried somewhere that might support your point if you actually have an argument put it all out there instead of just calling someone racist without anything to back it up and the go tell people well look it up
MMA,not_removed,am i right in inferring that this says hispanics are the majority race on reddit the most commonly expressed and upvoted opinions atleast in my experience suggest that is unlikely is an optin survey in meant to be irrefutable evidence also fact that some of the comments below are claiming there are more layers to this conspiracy with hispanic fighters being favoured the most by byrd over black fighters and with white fighters as the ultimate victims of her racism further led me to believe that perhaps not certainly but definitely the most likely case the majority of people commenting here were white the comparison to rblackpeopletwitter is a bit of silly one imo the most popular comments there make it pretty clear that it is not all black people while the comments on the majority of subreddits this one included do not generally provide any evidence against the conclusion that reddit is majority white
MMA,not_removed,the issue i had is mainly with the black people cant be racist duh shes only a judge because shes nonwhite and a woman this is why america needs trump circlejerk that is occurring and getting upvoted as a result of this thread i come to mma reddit to read and talk about interesting stuff about fights not witness people circlejerking about how silly black people are and how hard white people have it in comparison there is enough of that elsewhere if adelaide byrd is proven to be prejudice then yeah fuck her discussing the possibility of it using evidence is fine but there is no need for the circlejerking that i mentioned above
MMA,not_removed,well thats funny as a light skinned black guy like me you stick out like a sore thumb in africa and it is definitely commented on to the point though i dont see how this comment is relevant the majority of commenters here live in western countries if we were on reddit africa and the prevailing views here represented that you might have a point but as it is your comment just seems like an irrelevant way to try and attack
MMA,not_removed,and is played by dolph lundgren
MMA,not_removed,and what do those scorecards reveal she gets it wrong a lot yeah probably shes a racist that is not borne out by the scorecards there is no reason to arrive to that conclusion based on the facts if you want to bandwagon this thing nobodys going to stop you but it is just your opinion and if i were to repeat it it would be based on hearsay not based on the facts
MMA,not_removed,if the ufc did the judging hot prospects would always win think of the money the ufc lost when holly beat ronda hundreds of millions of dollars vanished in one headkick ko they wouldnt do the same thing and cost themselves money with decisions
MMA,not_removed,definitely i could be wrong here but i think that considering the limited range of possible scores that a judge could give for any given fight for a three round fight for a five round fight wed need a much larger sample to have any real confidence in our drawn conclusions ive always been mediocre with stats though so hopefully someone else can chime in here
MMA,not_removed,its not a selection bias if the data is in fact the actual data but thats the whole point its not all of the actual data if you dont look at fights where there was no dissent especially because she doesnt know what way the other judges will decide
MMA,not_removed,im not making any opinion on the topic but how does her not knowing the other judges scores have any effect if the allegation is true all she can do is turn in her score and hope one of the other two judges turns in a favorable score as well it is certainly true that if there were a racist judge that is all they could do themselves so unless youre somehow suggesting that the judges being blind somehow prevents discrimination then im not sure what youre trying to say
MMA,not_removed,actually out of her preference seems to be in order hispanicblackother only scored a white fighter as winner when white was the only option
MMA,not_removed,youre neglecting that she didnt have a nonwhite option in of those fights and that her preference is hispanic black white hispanics always won in hispanic vs any race blacks always won in black vs white in fights which involved a hispanic went hispanic in fights which involved a black and no hispanic went black the other three fights she only had white vs white
MMA,not_removed,how do you read this and say no bias in decisions where byrd dissented the hispanic fighter never lost and a white fighter never won against a nonwhite fighter the rule hispanic black other would correctly predict byrds decision in all of these fights
MMA,not_removed,everyone from on back regardless of intelligence would be considered a racist by todays standard so no
MMA,not_removed,typically i would agree with you when it comes to parroted tropes however this one isnt particularly deep its just a slightly more eloquent way of saying perhaps hes not evil just dumb
MMA,not_removed,you can politely decline their generosity
MMA,not_removed,wait the judges are essentially volunteers what do you mean
MMA,not_removed,shes very qualified as a judge didnt you know shes married to robert byrd his reffing has rubbed off on her shes qualified by proxy
MMA,not_removed,ask kramer
MMA,not_removed,bending at the waist putting dvds in the dvd player i dont know how they do it s
MMA,not_removed,yeah dont you know mothers are chefs and doctors and drivers and stylists and janitors and accountants and more
MMA,not_removed,cool fact but one of the first ufc announcers was a female i think during ufc
MMA,not_removed,gotta meet that gender quota
MMA,not_removed,my dad was a pilot for delta i assure you no one wants my mom to take over and fly the and yet were about to elect a president with the same well my husband did it credentials
MMA,not_removed,yes i am
MMA,not_removed,i think hes getting downvoted because he said deserved split ideally no fight is ever a split decision because it means the judges disagree but i also thought larkin won
MMA,not_removed,that doesnt really matter its that it as at least an option and she would refuse to do it so outright refusing to follow the judging criteria imagine two guys the bell rings and they both just sit down and do nothing for min no take down attempts no contact not even a strike attempted she would score the round for someone
MMA,not_removed,congrats man you deserve it
MMA,not_removed,why would you feel the need to deal with ushanecarwin things are perfect the way they are
MMA,not_removed,thanks for laying one out for us
MMA,not_removed,if only would do the same
MMA,not_removed,fuck you i train ufc ill kick your butt
MMA,not_removed,how did evidence show there wasnt enough proof literally every single split decision followed a pattern every single boxing split decision also followed this this is like fights where she was the lone split decision how is this not enough proof
MMA,not_removed,by that logic its not like op is providing proof here either just a handful of decisions in a longtime career
MMA,not_removed,you want to freely discuss her racism or her quality as a judge because one of those discussions isnt what i come here for i know the shitfests the general population here likes to get into regarding islam ive also seen upvoted posts that make attempts to defend joe rogans planet of the apes and body of a black man mind of a white man comments i dont come here to see what the state of rthedonald is like
MMA,not_removed,the fact that this unfounded accusation is stickied is embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,i think theres no harm in leaving it its good to see the arguments each way
MMA,not_removed,well now you have a post thats singling out a minority judge for apparently being racist with very little evidence to show for it by a submitter whose post history shows a fixation on muslims immigrants and racial issues european cant afford to have children because they have to pay for immigrants these immigrant are invaders committing a genocide how do you differentiate between a moderate muslim lol and an extremist one by the children of immigrants its even worse we even have to be worried about their children among others and you had a stickied mod comment approving the post by saying it poses some good points and definitely promotes discussion im not sure what your goal is for this sub but posts like this make this sub less inclusive to those who are new to mma calling her out on being a shitty judge is one thing making this a politically charged submission and mods claiming that the submitter poses good points is another
MMA,not_removed,i dont think it is a witch hunt people presented counter examples and some statistical proof against what the op claimed for the most part i see people discussing concrete examples of her judging and race in a reasonable way with a few on the sidelines upset that race could even be brought into it it was a valid concern that i think has been shown to be more nuanced than in the op why is that so unreasonable
MMA,not_removed,the poster has claimed immigrants are committing genocide muslims should be charged with treason and is a regular over at donald trumps sub this is pandering bullshit
MMA,not_removed,people pandered to crowds before the existence of meaningless internet points
MMA,not_removed,not pandering for karma its pandering to others who would jump to this conclusion when its a completely insignificant sample sie
MMA,not_removed,statistics are an angle but one single statistic without it being broken down doesnt spell the end of discussion try not to see the world so binary
MMA,not_removed,funny youre being downvoted to shit by the trump brigade
MMA,not_removed,round of their first fight was a lot fucking closer than you guys remember scoring it for silva isnt outlandish
MMA,not_removed,scroll up and look at the research total times she is the lone judge dissenting in decisions where byrd dissented the hispanic fighter never lost and a white fighter never won against a nonwhite fighter the rule hispanic black other would correctly predict byrds decision in all of these fights thats a pretty crazy stat esp in the fact that two other judges both scored it differently so shes the lone judge out doesnt happen a lot and in every case it did happen with her this pattern emerges have to really push head into sand to not see this
MMA,not_removed,how about if we put the racism accusations aside and all agree that she should not be judging fights i dont know how you came to out of but granting her that percentage its still unacceptable if a ref let fighters get killed in fights im sure it would be in thousands those times she got it so wrong that it is unacceptable when absolutely no one that saw a certain fight scores it the same as her this is a serious problem its not something that is okay to happen once much less times assuming thats the number its no wonder people are trying to figure out what her bias is but it is there and she needs to find something else to do with her time shit like that happens twice and she shouldnt have a job
MMA,not_removed,i think the person your responding tos point is to shut the fuck up with that bullshit here
MMA,not_removed,being black is so much easier
MMA,not_removed,nah see you need to dumb it down by not treating people as individuals but as the average of their race group then it all makes sense
MMA,not_removed,pfft yea the white house
MMA,not_removed,in terms of expectations and results delivered obama has been the most thoroughly disappointing president in my lifetime
MMA,not_removed,having a black president doesnt suddenly make every other white person running our political system less white of our politicians are still old white males only their positions arent over with in a few months edit having a black president also doesnt change the fact that black people generally face harsher sentences for the committing the same crimes as white people or the fact that they are at much higher risk for having their lives ruined for drug use even though they dont use it at significantly higher rates than other races etc these problems dont disappear once you have a black dude in the white house and we need to stop handwaving discussions about race with well u have a black president what more do u people want lol
MMA,not_removed,do you know how many black people who have taken african american studies i have had to explain this exact thing togod its annoying
MMA,not_removed,the dictionary lied to you
MMA,not_removed,i just find it funny that hes calling her a racist when his own comments are
MMA,not_removed,just clicked through uadamreals recent link and saw the headline shes black now i know
MMA,not_removed,i posted more fights and there is already fight in the op she scored the first round of silva weidman in favor of silva the only of the judges that did that two of the three judges who scored the fight for the year old calzaghe who is referred to as the prince of wales were white and their tallies were enough to overcome the scorecard of adalaide byrd who is black judge ted gimza scored it for calzaghe while chuck giampa had calzaghe winner by an even bigger margin boxingcommentator paulie malignaggi called out judge adalaide byrd for her score in favor of austin trout and plenty of other people posted others fight that follow the same pattern like the phan fight the lawlor fight lorenz larkin and some people downright posted that that showed she never gave a fight to a white fighter over a minority in a dissent decision
MMA,not_removed,no its not irrefutable evidence but neither is sentiment that no one can feel the full brunt of racism other than minorities the comparison to the sub was meant to point out that assumptions are not always right you just cant assume all redditors are white males anymore the world is bigger than that we disagree on your last point the one that is quoted in my original reply i just wanted to open a dialogue on that
MMA,not_removed,theres gonna be so much full penetration
MMA,not_removed,the helhound
MMA,not_removed,might as well make him a scientist named dolph lundgren in the movie so people dont get confused wild card
MMA,not_removed,dolph lundgren as dr dolph lundgren
MMA,not_removed,the evidence itself is not hearsay it just isnt the conclusion drawn from the documented facts of course is judgementbased and you dont have to agree that there is sufficient evidence but you can stop saying hearsay now
MMA,not_removed,i doubt it if the ufc tried to prop someone up with a series of bullshit judging decisions everyone would turn on the fighter the ufc is already in the position where they get to make the matches thats all they need to make somebody look better than they are i think an athletic commission judge taking a bribe to call a fight a certain way is much more likely
MMA,not_removed,but the fans will hate them for that
MMA,not_removed,think of the money the ufc lost when holly beat ronda err how so honestly how did they lose money did people demand refunds do you think the ufc placed vegas bets on their own fight
MMA,not_removed,thats just silly
MMA,not_removed,we agree
MMA,not_removed,but how does her not knowing the other judges scores have any effect the point is that the data was picked based on there being dissent from other judges since she had no way of knowing what the other judges scored it becomes a completely arbitrary way of looking at the data essentially you are then judging her actions with the hindsight of there having been dissent that she could not have had any knowledge of so in order to be fair you have to look at all the fights she has scored ever
MMA,not_removed,it means you cant just look at the scores where she is dissenting the other scores where she isnt are just as important
MMA,not_removed,she scored ishe smith over carlos molina so she doesnt always prefer hispanic over black there was also the case of an extremely close fight between sanjarbek rakhmanov white and alfonso olvera hispanic that ended in a draw she had scored the bout for rakhmanov if she had wanted to she could have easily given the bout to olvera it was extremely close and nobody would have second guessed it
MMA,not_removed,conclusions drawn from samples when there are hundreds more available are convincing to you huh thats great you should buy alphabrain by onnit their study had samples httpswwwonnitcomfilesonnitalphabrainclinicalpdf
MMA,not_removed,this isnt proof do you have concrete proof she is
MMA,not_removed,this is a bizarre way of claiming that there was some type of massive intelligence boost that the average person experienced and passed down to their offspring starting right at
MMA,not_removed,i know what it is both hanlons and occams razors are used too frequently as convenient attempts to handwave away logical analysis
MMA,not_removed,right its a logical razor that doesnt apply to this situation and when relied upon makes one unable to identify actual malice its incredibly short sighted and is taken as gospel unfortunately by less critical thinkers well known and useful are entirely different things occams razor is useful for scientific testing hanlons razor is useless noise as in cases like this its used specifically to rule out malice
MMA,not_removed,thanks but no thanks
MMA,not_removed,nah we good fam
MMA,not_removed,they arent they are paid by the commission
MMA,not_removed,they get paid sweet fuck all impossible to do it full time or even part time actually its not a job its something you do in your free time because you care about combat sports and know that somebody has to do it
MMA,not_removed,one of his greatest bits i thought roofing as a redhead in july was hard
MMA,not_removed,commentator not announcer
MMA,not_removed,kathy long shes a fucking legend
MMA,not_removed,i love it what gets reddit more riled up than perceived racism against white people perceived sexism against men white men the truly invisible minority am i right guys
MMA,not_removed,on paper hillary clinton is among the most credentialed nominees in modern history you dont have to like her i certainly dont but her platform is not hurr durr bill did it women strong
MMA,not_removed,that means a lot i really appreciate it i spend a lot of time here and i want to help make it a better community if you have any suggestions feel free to send me a pm anytime
MMA,not_removed,hey somebody has to do it
MMA,not_removed,nba is the worst good luck missing a game and planning on watching it in the morning uk viewer
MMA,not_removed,just dont go to the sub when you havent seen the race easy
MMA,not_removed,the entire discussion involves whether or not those two things are interrelated so by its nature you cant discuss only one or the other is she a bad judge biased or both that question plays a large role in analyzing her decisions i really have no interest in your race tirade either if a small minority of upvotes and uncomfortable opinions are too much for you to handle then get off the internet
MMA,not_removed,nothing is stickied what do you mean
MMA,not_removed,how is unfounded when we can compare both her card and the race of the fighters along with her history of judging thats pretty much evidence far from unfounded
MMA,not_removed,can you quote the exact part of the comment that was an unfounded accusation
MMA,not_removed,did you only read my comment and ignore the entire context of this discussion the headline is based on the analysis of fights i made no claim regarding the value or accuracy of these statistics i made a sarcastic reference to the absurdity of accusing someone of making racially motivated judgements based on a sample of out of try not to give unsolicited advice
MMA,not_removed,yeah sample size of racist the post title is all of the evidence required for most people
MMA,not_removed,weidman took silva down and dominated him for half of the round in the stand up besides the clowning it was basically even and this wasnt bullshit gnp this was damaging gnp weidman would have won the round with a takedown and control with little damage forget about what he actually did do
MMA,not_removed,its not bullshit though people get scared to talk about race and look to shut conversations down before people can address their issues running and hiding from race relations gets us nowhere theres no reason to get mad about me bringing up a fact of life
MMA,not_removed,its a possibility racial issues do exist we have the tendency to quickly shut down any of these conversations but its generally for the worse nothing can ever be improved without having conversations about difficult topics
MMA,not_removed,being black is definitely not so much easier its ridiculously harder are you saying that because things are harder we should willingly allow underhanded tactics to allow other races to catch up shouldnt we look for a system based on merit and enforce that above all else
MMA,not_removed,thats totally irrelevant to the matter at hand that being that one of the most powerful men in the world the american head of state is black not whether or not he met expectations
MMA,not_removed,clearly you are only
MMA,not_removed,considering that only of america is black of course there are less black people in politics
MMA,not_removed,that point about drugs if only by and large in metropolitan areas black people who do abuse drugs werent basically in the same couple of blocks i also cannot entertain someone complaining that they are not the only ones doing somethingthat argument didnt work in kindergarten and it doesnt work in real life where adults live either
MMA,not_removed,lmao why is this downvoted its a reasonable comment
MMA,not_removed,thankfully its removed now bullshit post and should never have been stickied low point for this sub
MMA,not_removed,okay to clarify just in case i accidentally implied this i am not saying that white people can not be discriminated against due to their race at all as that is obviously not true and would be a stupid thing to say however in western countries the as white people are the majority and hold the majority of the power imo racism will never have quite the same effect by nature of being a majority and being the norm there is a inherent difference in how racism effects a white person compared to how it effects a minority minorities people can absolutely be prejudiced but they have not held the power financially or socially in western countries to actually systemically oppress a white person when a minority experiences racism often by nature of being a minority they will feel more isolated and helpless because there arent as many people like them available that they can look to for support whereas a white person can feel comfort in the fact that atleast they arent any different to the majority of the country i feel like we are probably going to have to agree to disagree on this and god damn i kind of just want to get back to mma chat it just sucks seeing nasty comments about race on my favourite subreddit
MMA,not_removed,now heres the twist we show it
MMA,not_removed,here comes minutes of full penetration
MMA,not_removed,dont you hearsay me what to do
MMA,not_removed,do you happen to be black by chance this is an upvoted post here whos surprised
MMA,not_removed,the only people who would turn are the rmma hardcore and that doesnt mean shit extremely likely the ufc would pull strings at every opportunity they could however small
MMA,not_removed,i think both are ripe for corruption but the ufc has too much of a vested interest in certain fighters they lost a ton when sage northcutt lost there was even talk about barbarena getting punished for it
MMA,not_removed,i agree with the fact that no opinion should be made until more evidence is introduced thats why i said im refraining from one but i disagree with the idea that you have to know youre dissenting from the opinion of the other judges in order to find the intent i dont see why you guys feel that way at all if the idea is that she is biased the suggestion is that she is going to score for her preferred fighter regardless of the other judges actions i can guarantee you that her intent isnt to purposely cause a split decision by dissenting from the other judges opinion that has no gain for her or the fighter and is how people get noticed and then caught her hope each time is that one of the other two judges scores the fight in a similar way and thus the preferred fighter wins shes hoping they side with her she doesnt want to be the odd one out but by repeatedly scoring fights in an opposite fashion attention gets drawn to her again im speaking theoretically about the mindset of someone if they were judging with a bias towards race it would take a very detailed study for me to form the opinion that she is discriminating however i am deeply suspicious based on a few fights ive watched specifically where her score was the exact opposite of what i and the other judges score when i hear her name announced ive been on the lookout for unusual decisions and ive noticed some im suspicious but nothing more but the notion that not knowing the other judges score seems irrelevant to me the idea would never be to purposely standout against the others if anyone were to be a biased judge all they could do is hope someone else scored it their way as well gathering the dissenting scores of other judges in split decisions and finding somewhat of an average percentage of occurrence and comparing it to hers would be a good way to see how much alarm there should be if youre racist and the races of your choice are winning fights on their own you dont need to dissent for them to win the more important data is how often it goes the other way and comparing it to the average all of the information needs to be looked at before any opinions should be made obviously this isnt enough
MMA,not_removed,no its a completely logical way of explaining that theres no correspondence between intelligence and racism
MMA,not_removed,im more of a norelco guy myself
MMA,not_removed,i never understood this phrase
MMA,not_removed,or they sell their vote to the highest bidder something like that since these people get paid shit if they really cared about combat sports why in the fuck would they stick around if they keep consistently fucking up decisions something doesnt add up just a bunch of crooks
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i dont think the issue is so much discrimination towards men but seeking unqualified individuals to fit a quota or to be perceived as not sexistracist its a real thing whether that happened here is hard to say but i think there is fair evidence byrd is unqualified and incompetent at the very least her husband is apparently robert byrd so this might be more of an issue of nepotism
MMA,not_removed,its not about discrimination of any party its the simple truth that gender quotas are fucking idiotic
MMA,not_removed,its hard out there for us we used to get preferential treatment of the time but now that its down to were essentially class citizens with a plight that no other people could know or understand
MMA,not_removed,she has experience but her experience is in being a corrupt politician
MMA,not_removed,in paper hillary clinton is among the most credentialed nominees in modern history like what
MMA,not_removed,everywhere she got in politics was due to her husband being there first though she also carpet bagged her way to a senate seat in a highly democratic area in the richest city in america which was no coincidence and her secretary of state career was arguably a disaster not to mention that she didnt give a fuck about security and gave people without clearance access to her emails because she thinks the rules dont apply to her all of her credentials werent earned because she loves public service or government shes wanted to be president for decades and everything she has done has been to that end
MMA,not_removed,nope mike what
MMA,not_removed,how about we make a rmma sexy calendar with users from the sub
MMA,not_removed,i stayed off rmma and facebook last night only to have sports talk radio spoil it right as i got out of the car they never talk about ufc
MMA,not_removed,sigh this is what everyone says when something big happens it goes up on not only your front page but the front page of rall as well well dont use the internet or and heres a crazy thought instead of alienating every fan that cant watch the race by asking them to not use the internet until theyre able to watch it you just put spoiler before your post titles on sunday
MMA,not_removed,you are the perfect example of what this sub is becoming i always subscribed to kevin macdonalds theory of jewish radical political views as a group evolutionary strategy especially in the post war years adorno you guessed ita jew took freuds jew psychoanalysis and applied it to hitlers psyche in his book the authoritarian personality which was hugely influential despite being a crock of shit essentially in accordance to what the book posits modern jews see white ethnocentrism as a necessary stepping stone to jewish persecution obviously not true but nonetheless many believe that is where it comes from are you a jew as well the liberal strawmen arent necessary libtard a regular poster on reuropeannationalism rthedonald ranarchocapitalism an open racist telling me to get off the internet if i couldnt handle this shit i already wouldnt be here im just disappointed in the direction you people are taking a sub i used to love
MMA,not_removed,i think your aggressive response is why its received so badly
MMA,not_removed,no the topic just isnt relevant show us some official decree of minorities getting quotas in judging in mma and then well fucking talk till then fight this battle wherever its relevant
MMA,not_removed,the system is unjust and every try to do something about it people start crying about fairness but are quite content with the status qou and about quotas most instituwould rather hirerent todo business with white over black despite equal qualifications this practice hugely outweighs whatever youre referring to does that bother you or just the tiny minority that allegedly does the opposite
MMA,not_removed,what kind of power has he influenced when he pissed it all away did you vote for him does that make you racist because you werent in favor of a black person in office no so doesnt that make your whole point moot
MMA,not_removed,im telling my mommy on you
MMA,not_removed,the problem isnt that theres less the problem is that its disproportionate so if american politicans were black i would accept your point
MMA,not_removed,if only by and large in metropolitan areas black people who do abuse drugs werent basically in the same couple of blocks having trouble with this sentence and my point has nothing to do with white people do it too so its not as bad if we do it my problem is that black people are targeted disproportionately thats all
MMA,not_removed,except they take all precharge characteristics into account take a look at the actual so a lot but not all of the sentencing disparity can be explained away things like criminal history if only there were some other factor at play that could explain this hmm this is amusing to me without even doing any research whatsoever you automatically assumed its because the black people had more priors and we dumb liberals couldnt have possibly thought of that
MMA,not_removed,thats what i get for trying to bring the white man down
MMA,not_removed,i swear to god ill pistol whip the next person i hear say hearsay
MMA,not_removed,i think youd not be surprised mother fuckers
MMA,not_removed,the ufc would be better off creating an independent judging commission with other mma groups if just to avoid the appearance of impartiality people already hate judges if the ufc started judging that hate would eventually get turned toward the ufc
MMA,not_removed,there probably is a correspondence between quality education and racist tendencies in the us but its very naive to think smart people are never racist intelligence under any measurement has very little to do with it
MMA,not_removed,thank you for the offer but no thank you i would not like it
MMA,not_removed,never leave it to the judges
MMA,not_removed,uhh lol
MMA,not_removed,oh shit staticx middle school flashbacks in an instant
MMA,not_removed,jesus christ shes a gorgeous badass
MMA,not_removed,do you know if they have a quota or are we just pulling that tidbit of fact from our buttholes
MMA,not_removed,theres no fucking quota youre all getting really upset over something that someone on the internet just made up adelaide byrd having the job that she has is very clearly an issue of nepotism
MMA,not_removed,so are race quotas its much harder for certain ethnicities to get accepted into ivy league universities than others
MMA,not_removed,reality in a clear case of nepotism a woman gets a cushy position in an organization because she married to a high ranking member of said organization reddit you see this is obviously a feminist conspiracy because
MMA,not_removed,did you stop and wonder if they have one or is this just your explanation for every time a woman does something you disagree with
MMA,not_removed,yeah fuck principles
MMA,not_removed,so a perfect candidate for the job posting
MMA,not_removed,everywhere she got in politics was due to her husband being there first though how in the fuck is this being downvoted unless im mistaken her first elected position was senator of new york a job she never would have won if she wasnt married to bill
MMA,not_removed,mike rotch
MMA,not_removed,as long as i get to be ms december
MMA,not_removed,oh fuck no way i suppose its good that mma is getting more out there but damn
MMA,not_removed,you can filter the sub so it wont show up on rall
MMA,not_removed,we fuckin did that already once and it sucked it was super hard to make a post so that people knew what it was about without spoiling it which is why they got rid of the no spoiler rule and most people are glad its gone it was horrible also when i miss a race the only way i use reddit is by typing in the sub i want
MMA,not_removed,you know what if you miss something it isnt up to the rest of the world to accommodate you until you get around to watching it
MMA,not_removed,im sorry you cant handle different viewpoints i also barely post here so im not sure how ive played a part in doing anything to this sub nor was anything you referenced racist
MMA,not_removed,huh what kind of logic is that we dont need any official shit to have a discussion thats ridiculous someone feels a certain way we talk about it and we see what is what we dont shame people for bringing up racial issues op seems like he might be on to something here its an interesting topic and the mods allow it for open discussion for a reason discussions arent bad would it make you feel more comfortable if byrd was a different race
MMA,not_removed,i call for fairness and you assume that i want one group to get the edge over the other where is your logic sir we should all want fairness and live in a meritocracy thats the goal human nature wont allow it but thats what we strive for i do agree though if two people have equal everything the white will get chosen over the black so does that make picking blacks who arent as qualified over whites to even the score its tough huh
MMA,not_removed,way to miss the whole point a black man is in the highest office in the usa and you reject the idea that hes powerful simply because its inconvenient to your argument does that make you racist because you werent in favor of a black person in office yes if you are against a black man in office that makes you racist if you are against obama an individual who happens to also be black in office that is totally fine
MMA,not_removed,of congressman are black not but close
MMA,not_removed,well if more les were ruining their lives with jail timeprison time who knows the world cannot just be fair no one moves out of your way so you can have their place in line if there were more reasonable politicians like obama and less motherfucking crazy racistahem bigoted people like jessie jackson or al sharpton
MMA,not_removed,thats what you get for dumbing the scenario down by pointing out that obama is president he wasnt saying that black people as a group why the fuck are we taking the average of a group rather than the individuals in the scenario have power but to show an obvious hole in your rule that states because hes black he must have no power that completely goes over your head and you continue on as if hes making an argument that black people on average have power
MMA,not_removed,if an independent commission could be started id be all for it for sure
MMA,not_removed,thats what im saying
MMA,not_removed,i guess no thanks communicates the same thing and isnt redundant
MMA,not_removed,thats not how it works no thanks more appropriately has comma where youre declining and still saying thanks youre not saying no gratitude for you
MMA,not_removed,i understand the reasoning behind that phrase but its like saying never leave a package in the hands of a courier you cant be expected to travel across the country to deliver every package you post and you should be able to trust a courier its a phrase which shifts the blame from the judges to the fighters though i know the intention is to say you cant do anything about the bad judges the only thing you can have any control over is the finish focus on that its the job of the judges to judge fights they shouldnt be hired if theyre incompetent
MMA,not_removed,theyre just correcting the record the thought police cant have people saying what they want about hilary its astonishing how little her supporters care about the horrible corrupt shit she does but then when it is complete public knowledge that her campaign is using the same internet dialogue policing tactics of putin their lack of reaction is just amazing
MMA,not_removed,so creative
MMA,not_removed,just put spoiler at the front of the title if you cant stop yourself from reading further thats your fault no need to be mysterious in the description
MMA,not_removed,except many fans are in my exact same position is a global sport and many arent able to watch the race live due to time zone restrictions
MMA,not_removed,if you say so
MMA,not_removed,lmao this is preposterous youre dancing around all the arguments that you yourself made
MMA,not_removed,theres two black senators right now thats like so not close and overall there have been members of the senate and only nine of those have been black of course there is diversity to be found but overall the issue persists
MMA,not_removed,can i ask what makes obama reasonable more than other black people hes one of the levelheaded blacks right but why hes killed thousands of civilians with drone strikes not discolising the numbers till hes leaving office he promised to be a progressive on the side of the working man yet bailed out wall street right when he came into office he expanded the military budget more than bush did invaded libya without having a plan and destablizied the region he expanded use of spying on us citizens to absurd levels so why is he reasonable because hes charming why is he one of the decent blacks as for your first point take a look at jeb bush he smoked a lot of pot in college just like a lot of people did never got in any legal trouble for it whatsoever still became a politician and it didnt matter alright well what about the thousands of kids that did the same things he did just like normal kids growing up but didnt have wealth and were born in a poor black commmunity and therefore had there lives ruined over nothing they didnt harm anyone but simply dont have the option of becoming a success anymore my point is its not as simple as well if you dont want b in jail dont do bad things we live in a corrupt system and its ridiculous to aknowledge the corruptness of that system but then ignore it as well lifes not fair
MMA,not_removed,uh yeah which is why i specifically said this so a lot but not all of the sentencing disparity can be explained away things like criminal history the entire point of the study is basically what explains the unless youre implying that in this scenario is trivial when can mean years of someones life i tend not to just handwave it and try to figure out what can actually cause a disparity like that
MMA,not_removed,well the logic that was used in referring to obama being in the white house is identical to that used when people say that its cold right now so global warming isnt be real sure some people within a group can succeed but those individual successes dont necessarily indicate equality in a social system
MMA,not_removed,but to show an obvious hole in your rule that states because hes black he must have no power but he never said that he said overall compared to white people black people have relatively no power now can you please explain how you interpreted this to mean black people as individuals cannot rise to positions of power you know that isnt what was meant and if you want to talk shit about me dumbing the scenario down then take a look at your logic first why the fuck are we taking the average of a group rather than the individuals in the scenario because to ignore that race exists and affects how people percieve and behave towards us on a daily basis is to ignore reality so if i say something like black people are judged harsher for the committing the same crimes as white people thats wrong do you see how it wouldnt be constructive to say but thats just overall you cant prove anything on an individual level
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah i completely agree with you the people downvoting you are the naive ones i think they arent even applying logic to what youre saying just responding on some misguided impulse
MMA,not_removed,i knew that someone would interpret it as if i was blaming the fighters no the judges are absolutely the goofs i was just implying that there is a reason people say that judges fuck up the only way you can be that it wont affect you is if you finish it not saying its by any means an easy thing regardless of the level of competition
MMA,not_removed,sorry i shouldnt joke around like that his real name is mike hunt
MMA,not_removed,that wouldnt work you would still see the rest of the title even if you didnt try to i just dont get how it so hard to avoid the sub until youve seen the race as i said i do it almost every race
MMA,not_removed,you arent able to watch it live how does that create a limitation on the free speech of others
MMA,not_removed,how am i supposed to respond youre throwing together questions that make no sense in context ill humour you just out of hopes that youll realise that your entire angle is ridiculous what kind of power has he influenced when he pissed it all away the fuck kind of a question is this this is still irrelevant no matter how many times you rephrase is hes still the president with all the powers allotted to the office what he has done with it is a moot point as it is a matter of obamas personal ability not a commentary on the power of black people in american society did you vote for him how is this in any way important im not even american even if i was it doesnt matter if i voted for him what matters is enough people voted for this black man to make him president does that make you racist because you werent in favor of a black person in office no ive already answered this question and its still just as retarded as a last time so doesnt that make your whole point moot do explain how this makes my point moot im interested on your convoluted opinion on the matter
MMA,not_removed,youre arguing this as if he came into a discussion about how blacks are targeted more by police and someone said but obama if that happened then your objection would be fine but its the opposite youre coming into a discussion about one individual and saying that blacks as a group have no power when its not relevant at all we know for mathematical fact that her power is it does not matter if the other two judges are asian males she will make up exactly of the total judging power
MMA,not_removed,he said overall compared to white people black people have relatively no power well no he said except for that dude in the white house a clear disdain for your method of deciding whether or not an individual has power which for some wacky reason is to take the average of their race group now can you please explain how you interpreted this to mean black people as individuals cannot rise to positions of power nobody did that it was just disliked that it was assumed this black women has no power to affect anything because to ignore that race exists and affects how people percieve and behave towards us on a daily basis is to ignore reality so if i say something like black people are judged harsher for the committing the same crimes as white people thats wrong do you see how it wouldnt be constructive to say but thats just overall you cant prove anything on an individual level how is that relevant in this context
MMA,not_removed,i dont disagree but the phrase has become so ingrained that i do think theres too much leniency on bad judges if you or i say dont leave it in the hands of the judges its not such a big deal since were in no position to do anything about it when dana says it though and when its written above the doors in the tuf gym you have to wonder if theyre even doing anything about it or just repeating that phrase to encourage reckless fighting styles i know that its the athletic commissions who assign the judges but something must be doable the ufc managed to get steve mazagatti relegated to nonufc events after danas long campaign against him
MMA,not_removed,dont have the desire to engage you fully so why dont you make yourself useful and answer these questions explain to me how you feel obamas presidency did away with racism trick question he didnt question youre insinuating that because enough people voted for him that automatically makes our country not racist youre wrong on the premise i just presented how is that possible
MMA,not_removed,its not one or the other you cant say race is not a factor its all wealth or the other way around because they both come in to play most race issues in todays society can be attributed to economic standing to give one example of where that isnt the case i linked that study here about sentencing severity and race they take into account all precharge characteristics such as economic standing and criminal background and still theres a disparity why can you tell me what explains the disparity if it isnt race and it isnt wealth if youre so confident race couldnt possibly play a factor this should be easy for you i never said white people are inherently powerful or anything like that im saying white people tend to have a disproportinate share of wealth and power today thats all i have been ticketed and arrested for drugs and im white so i could name countless black celebrities that are more rich and successful and get less trouble from police than you but it wouldnt really be saying much because exceptions dont define how we are treated on a daily basis its just not the end all excuse the left makes it out to be i dont know what youre trying to argue here then because i never claimed it absolved anyone of resonsibility
MMA,not_removed,a lot but not all was misleading how so a lot of the disparity can be explained away but not all of it can is not insignificant at all how is that misleading there are so many factors that could go into something like this yet youre so quick to call someone who you dont even kno yes there are a lot of factors nobody is denying this but you for some reason seem to be denying that race is also a factor in addition to all these things i never called anyone a racist and its telling that you seem to think just because i call attention to a very real disparity i must be insulting someone
MMA,not_removed,but thats exactly what happened one person literally said blacks by and large are powerless and the reply to that was except for that dude in the white house its an irrelevant illogical argument and it should be treated as such
MMA,not_removed,which for some wacky reason is to take the average of their race group what the fuck are you even on about here yes thats what im discussing here the average position a person of a particular race generally finds themselves in todays society if you want to talk about well there are exceptions tho then you are free to i dont care but yes im discussing what happens generally and if you think talking about averages is some kind of logical fallacy then i dont know what to tell you nobody did that then dont claim my rule is that black people inherently have no power if you dont actually think that how is that relevant in this context when you say things like thats just the average tho it makes it impossible to have the sort of discussions im talking about here what im saying is by the logic you keep using about averages if i bring up a ricial issue such as the disparity between crime and punishment among races you can say well why would you just use the averages of what happens to what races thats just averages it doesnt mean anything
MMA,not_removed,pound leg extension
MMA,not_removed,he basically confirmed hell continue to train as stupid as possible no mather what
MMA,not_removed,insert cain leg extension video here
MMA,not_removed,when people say dont blame the coaches i think of edmonds face
MMA,not_removed,crazy thing is that aka could have had champs in one gym khabib luke dc cain the results speak for themselves but so do the pull outs
MMA,not_removed,changes were made results are the same lets not blame the coaches though clearly all these guys are getting injured because they just cant restrain themselves s
MMA,not_removed,we know its not entirely their fault but their hands are still not clean my uneducated guess is that their strength and conditioning coach got his degree from the university of bro science something needs to change to ensure that the fighters can train smarter pay a little bit extra and get someone who really knows what theyre talking about an argument can be made that they build champions at aka yes thats true but they also break them
MMA,not_removed,changes he then admits he did not accept or implement hah no reason any ufc champs should fight though why risk losing the title when you can hold onto it for at least a year being injured
MMA,not_removed,these guys at aka are taking that no pain no gain mentality way too far
MMA,not_removed,i would assume that dc knows how to train he is not only a pro fighter but a pro and getting prepared for world class competitionsomething none of us know anything about yes weve seen some questionable strength and conditioning with akabut you also have of the top guys in the sport fighting out of aka so they are doing a lot of things right what dc said about the mental part of prep and training makes sense i doubt he is training recklessly but if he isnt confident in the work he put in it could lose him the fight
MMA,not_removed,someone will be injured next month and it still wont be the coaches fault according to aka
MMA,not_removed,conspiracy theory with gsp not happening and knowing the card would underwhelm in ppv since its sandwiched between and rouseys return at dc purposely pulls out and reschedules to a more favorable time before jon jones return
MMA,not_removed,theyre only doing heavy leg extensions and ultra heavy kettlebell swings once a week now its fine guys totally different
MMA,not_removed,the silver lining from all of these injuries is that we know aka is clean or at least whatever theyre using isnt working
MMA,not_removed,okay daniel we wont
MMA,not_removed,aka the pullout masters
MMA,not_removed,well dan you had a good run just be glad you came out of fighting with the ability to string words together in a coherent sentence for broadcast tv
MMA,not_removed,for me i felt a little bit off he said i felt like i didnt do as much as i needed to do and it really messed with me mentally now i spar a lot and i run a lot and i train a lot its the only way that i feel secure in my own mind the biggest part of competition if knowing that ive done enough to fight its scary if its the other way then what you need is a mental coach daniel youve done enough sparring
MMA,not_removed,aka has the most injuries but they have a bunch of older heavier fighters
MMA,not_removed,a gym that produced world champs yeah aka is such terrible gym
MMA,not_removed,this is the guy who always talks about how cain and him push each other why the fuck would i blame javier and bob cook these two morons are having real fights at the gym like theyre at chute box in
MMA,not_removed,this is why i hate reddit i post in the thread about cormier being out saying its his fault and nobody elses fault and i got down voted to oblivion by people who have never trained and dont understand what happens during training camps and here we have dc saying it himself its his fault and nobody elses fault gotta love those emotional and irrational idiots who down vote because you disagree with someone
MMA,not_removed,eh nah we blame you idiot fighters
MMA,not_removed,there is video of khabib and rockhold sparring why would an average sized spar with someone likely heavier that is just asking for an injury
MMA,not_removed,we have to calculate sea level here
MMA,not_removed,thats an old video and that guy is no longer at aka and had no affiliation with the team he was just a strength coach who cain hired and is gone now hence the changes were already made im with dc on this one people on this sub always point to guys like cerrone who dont spar and say look you dont need to spar at all to fight but hes the exception these people are professional fighters they have to step into a cage in front of thousands of people and get into a fist fight with another man sometimes we forget that they need to train its a tough job and its a tough sport you cant just do cardio for weeks then fight someone in order to fight well you need to practice fighting you need to get up your cardio and you need to be strong as fuck these arent ordinary people theyre ridiculous athletes whose goal is to beat another man to the point where he cant continue and if dc needs to train hard in order to feel safe in the octagon he should do that
MMA,not_removed,yeah but damn the results he has hadthe riskreward factor is huge with dc makes sense what he said about ufc
MMA,not_removed,well the idea of changing it up at this point must feel questionable hes and he only lost a decision to jones despite starting mma at you think he feels like he trained wrong
MMA,not_removed,hopefully ill make it these fights man um what thats not very reassuring
MMA,not_removed,he mentioned on the mma hour that sometimes he trains times in a daythats how you get injured
MMA,not_removed,this dc admits he trains too much and it cost the ufc millions in advertising and cost the fans a fight they waited to see not to mention people who ought tickets what an idiot
MMA,not_removed,i promise you when i fought the last fight cain and i made some changes to our training it worked great for cain he looked fantastic against travis browne as for his situation cormier says he didnt like the results of this new way of training when he last fought at ufc for me i felt a little bit off he said i felt like i didnt do as much as i needed to do and it really messed with me mentally now i spar a lot and i run a lot and i train a lot its the only way that i feel secure in my own mind the biggest part of competition is knowing that ive done enough to fight its scary if its the other way
MMA,not_removed,serious question but doesnt that joe grasso guy have nothing to do with aka
MMA,not_removed,the kettlebell swings are worse imo horrible form my back hurts just looking at him do it
MMA,not_removed,well these superstars have a say in their own training just look at javier mendes when he tried to tell cain to go to mexico city long before the fight to get accustomed to the altitude cain didnt wanna cause he didnt want to leave his family and he ended up compromising by going weeks ahead now we have the sea level cain meme
MMA,not_removed,just read an article earlier in the week that showed they have the highest pull out rate of any camp at they clearly are doing some things wrong edit typo
MMA,not_removed,the amount of bro science sc coaches knockin around mma seems crazy the hailed nick curson has no qualifications other than bro science
MMA,not_removed,pay a little bit extra and get someone who really knows what theyre talking about it always seems like that the bad guy in these situations is always being paid a lot anyway
MMA,not_removed,getting paid for one
MMA,not_removed,i would have assumed that dc knew how to properly cut weight as an olympian but he even acknowledge that he was cutting improperly which led to his kidney failure training recklessly like they did at chute boxe is one thing but my guess is that he still maintains the old school wrestling mentality of pushing your body to or past its limits during training
MMA,not_removed,dc knows how to train that is for certain however he is making an error in thinking that the way you train is static he seems to be negligent of the fact that training methods must adapt to an aging frame dc is no spring chicken neither is cain but cain seems to have finally woken up to the fact
MMA,not_removed,for the record those videos have nothing to do with aka as far as i remember
MMA,not_removed,no you dont fuck them
MMA,not_removed,at sea level they should be able to get those water floaties you put on kids arms they need them for their knees
MMA,not_removed,sparring hard will make you peak faster but end your career sooner a lot of fighters are moving away from hard sparring wonderboy says thats a lot of these gyms where they go out there and try to beat the crap out of each other ive been to some gyms where theyre wearing the ufc mma gloves going all out knocking each other out and thats just ridiculous he said its why a lot of these guys are young and they dont have any chins anymore sic theyre career is gone because theyve beaten the crap out of each other you cannot condition the brain
MMA,not_removed,he had a partially torn ligament in his knee he chose not to get it fixed because of down time now hes missed fights and might aswell have gotten the surgery before it fully tore he took a risk it didnt pay off
MMA,not_removed,you also need to spar to get your specific cardio for fighting i for example can go at a decent pace for five rounds but if i do suicide runs on a basketball court which i dont usually do i feel like im gonna have a myocardial infarction
MMA,not_removed,exactly i swear some people just like to repeat what they hear the video of cain doing that dumb shit isnt even at aka its him training at the guys facility
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck are u talking about cerrone has been into hard sparring pretty much full throttle until maybe years ago max that and jet skiing
MMA,not_removed,i actually agree yes hes been injured but the results when he fights are top notch
MMA,not_removed,good one little fella
MMA,not_removed,thats also how you go in mma after a successful amateur wrestling career with your only loss to jon jones
MMA,not_removed,a lot of fighters train up to times a day conors mentioned it for one and hes never pulled out of a fight as far as i recall
MMA,not_removed,or dc admits training hard has given him the confidence and his results so far champion gets sidelined for months seems like a small price to pay hes a professional athlete who knows what he needs to do to win hed probably rather sit for a few months than go into the cage feeling unprepared
MMA,not_removed,what he does to feel secure most likely hurts his performance damaging himself unnecessarily before a fight and when he was saying his coaches and luke where saying he shouldnt spar as much as he does thats concerning
MMA,not_removed,he should go see a sports psychologist if he hasnt already
MMA,not_removed,what qualifies as running a lot for cormier
MMA,not_removed,sparring a lot for experienced fighters is almost certainly more risky than beneficial distance running is mostly a waste of time for combat sports athletes but it produces an endorphin hit that feels good these are emotional coping tools not ideal training practices
MMA,not_removed,yes
MMA,not_removed,theyre also one of the older camps out there i think their average age is in the thats a large contributor as well
MMA,not_removed,is there a stat like this for shoot box when they were koing each other in sparring
MMA,not_removed,aka is also a pretty small camp as far as i know
MMA,not_removed,their pull out game is strong
MMA,not_removed,no having the belt is worth much more than a single fight purse
MMA,not_removed,im insinuating every ufc champ has a big financial incentive to postpone fights as much and as long as possible its why champs pull out of more fights due to injury than any other fighters and why title challengers hardly ever pull out that title is worth a ton im sure he has a real injury but not the sort of thing that would make dc pull out if he were challenging for the title
MMA,not_removed,these guys all training hard together and pushing each other is what brings them to the next level
MMA,not_removed,him missing this fight has nothing to do with his knee though it has to do with his groin
MMA,not_removed,great point
MMA,not_removed,thats what im saying people look at him now and go you dont need to spar to be a top level fighter but he sparred a ton before this and hes also an exception when it comes to now
MMA,not_removed,except when he fights jbj
MMA,not_removed,thats also how you injure yourself and pull out of two title fights in one year
MMA,not_removed,he admits both but he does clearly say its his fault and nobodies fault but his own
MMA,not_removed,doesnt a lot of this come from having wrestled at a high level overtraining is common within wrestling programs after competing at such a high level in wrestling for so long maybe he cant overcome that mindset where if he doesnt overtrain himself he isnt doing enough he only feels prepared if he over trains himself but now that hes older hes beginning to break down and his body cant keep it up like it could in high school and college im just guessing this is how hes feeling ive had a lot of friends who wrestled throughout high school and college who thought like this and as they are getting older now and trying to transition into bjj andor mma they have started getting injured more often
MMA,not_removed,he strikes me as the kinda guy who would draw the value of psychology in general into question just man up through it that sorta thing
MMA,not_removed,to the popeyes and back
MMA,not_removed,not necessarily true about the distance running after a certain point liss cardiovascular training is the only way to progress in the long term
MMA,not_removed,and iirc its been almost years
MMA,not_removed,oh wow i never thought of this this makes a lot of sense
MMA,not_removed,if you listen to his interview about this he literally cant lift one of his legs off the ground by itself they were doing grappling drills off his back and he had to lift his leg with his hand to put it into position for drills seems like the kind of shit you just cant fight with
MMA,not_removed,when a ligament is torn the muscles around it overcompensate when youre training rigorously the muscles dont have appropriate time to adjust and heal not saying im a doctor but its possible that the injury is somehow related
MMA,not_removed,yeah and hes even talked about still sparring a little bit and for every cowboy who does fine without sparring you have a lawler who fell off and had a massive career resurgence once he started sparring again then theres some people like mousasi who basically just spar thats most of what he does to train apparently and he doesnt really get injured sparring isnt a problem the way you do it can be though
MMA,not_removed,even then cormier put up a fight sure jones was clearly better but cormier looked about as good as anyone has against bones jones
MMA,not_removed,thats what professional athletes do they train too much they take steroids they are geneticathletic freaks they push the limit because at the end of the day we are watching to be entertained and superhumans are entertaining
MMA,not_removed,yes but he says he doesnt feel prepared unless he trains hard sometimes injuries just happen am i saying he didnt overdo it training no i dont know that and neither do you what i am saying is that he has a certain work ethic while training that has worked incredibly well for him this injury is a small price for that success the injury doesnt prove his training poor or dangerous and theres no reason to make assumptions about whether it was good or bad you called him an idiot for training the way he always has with great results hes not an idiot and if he was doing something wrong im sure hell adjust for next time
MMA,not_removed,that wrestling mentality is hard to break especially for an olympian its the reason he became an olympian the motto in wrestling is to train train and train more every wrestling camp successful wrestlers come in and tell you what they did quotes such as train while your opponent is sleeping are constantly repeated rest is for pussies its only now that some places are starting to see the benefits of rest and sometimes even taking some time off
MMA,not_removed,interesting read but without an references its an op ed not science and it loses some credibility when it lumps jump rope and sled dragging in with a bunch of other stuff as road work multiple miles ran slowly on the street does more wear on knees and ankles than anything else
MMA,not_removed,champs are most likely to pull out of fights title challengers are least likely gus did it once and one other person did it this year thats it it happens about once ever months but title holders the champs they pull out of nearly every scheduled fight and guys like dj get way more money from endorsement deals as ufc champ than they get paid by the ufc to fight dj gets like to fight as champ though he actually does fight he pulled out for the first time only recently against wilson reis guys like dc always talk about only wanting to fight at thats a luxury most guys cannot afford only a champ can afford to do that bc of all the other sources of income plus dc gets paid a ton to do the fox analyst stuff trust me the mere fight purse is no incentive to risk losing that belt not even close and the stats back that up any ufc champ would gladly go years without fighting if the ufc would let them oops injured again
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,with the exception of gustafsson also you are forgetting hamill kod jon with some nasty headbutts to his elbow edit managed to spell both names wrong
MMA,not_removed,i get what youre saying ultimately though its up to a fighter who he decides to train with either he decided to train with someone who was too aggressive with someone who has a fight coming up or he was being too aggressive himself i get that pushing your limits yields great results but rolling the dice you eventually get snake eyes and thats completely on the fighter and nobody else if an injury occurs times eventually your number comes up sometimes fighters get the bad luck and their number comes up more often than it should like dominick cruz for example but eventually youre number does come up and most cases who you are training with and how hard you are training dictates how bad the injury is itself that probably doesnt make sense i can explain in more detail if needed not saying you are wrong just that we both have points that are relevant
MMA,not_removed,why does it lose credit for the jump ropesled dragging i think the other low intensity exercises are included due to the designation its one of the main points of the article it doesnt need to be all running it agree while it is an op ed but there is some merit to it as the ideas are based on scientific principles for a more scientific review of the materiel but more focused on weight training check greg nuckols article which does include some references httpstrengtheorycomavoidingcardiocouldbeholdingyouback
MMA,not_removed,sbg
MMA,not_removed,sparring like idiots has nothing to do with who you train with demetrious johnson and joanna jedrzejczyk were both out of little known camps btw
MMA,not_removed,i didnt forget that it was the dq that foreshadowed jones being his own worst enemy the only person who beat jones is jones it is literally right there in his mma record
MMA,not_removed,the criticisms of running repetitive loweffort limited range of movement in fewer muscles dont apply to movements that arent running to call stuff that isnt distance running on roads roadwork isnt an effective argument in favor of regular distance running as a component of fighter conditioning the view that distance running is at best a net neutral activity if not net harmful for a fighter is barely addressed by either article you have linked
MMA,not_removed,all i was arguing was the cardiovascular benefits of running are probably greater than just endorphins i agree about the risks of wear and tear your criticism against other forms of low intensity exercises being included in the article seems to be more of a problem with the the programs name then content joel jamieson is pretty well respected in combat sports condition and very knowledgeable when it comes to energy systems if he is recommending liss in particular some roadwork he is probably worth listening to im def not saying cormiers training is ideal though
MMA,not_removed,this was never about the caliber of your training partners that was a tangent you initiated its about overtraining and taking years off of your career in gym sessions
MMA,not_removed,i am a believes in lowintensity work just not literal roadwork get in the pool hit the rowing machine bike up and down some mountains even running on sand just stay off the damn pavement
MMA,not_removed,horrible picture op hope this isnt your handiwork
MMA,not_removed,natty no doubt
MMA,not_removed,biceps always with you my friend
MMA,not_removed,i dont really have an issue with nonathletes juicing to the gills
MMA,not_removed,tainted supplement ya morons
MMA,not_removed,eggs are high in protein
MMA,not_removed,lighting ya goof
MMA,not_removed,everyone is on steroids not just the fighters
MMA,not_removed,he mustve eaten an entire stable of horses
MMA,not_removed,who cares i wish i could afford danas stack
MMA,not_removed,not even a single tanning bed
MMA,not_removed,i mean if he ate clean and trened hard for years that physique is totally attainable im gonna have to go with natty on this one op is a just a cheeto fingered hater than never lifted in his life
MMA,not_removed,and still being fat
MMA,not_removed,gimp then
MMA,not_removed,woah woah woahyou hatin on cheetos bro because ill fuck a bag of cheetos up my dude
MMA,not_removed,steroids arent fat burners
MMA,not_removed,he looks like super yoked baby
MMA,not_removed,geoblocked to murica
MMA,not_removed,eh the videos blocked anyhow im sure dana is happy af with this card great fights some big upsets just an action packed and enjoyable card though i bet the numbers wont be big cause everyone was bitching about this card not being stacked enough when tbf that shit means nothing we got a stacked card and shit turned out mediocre
MMA,not_removed,it will be a long time before theres a fight with this level of build up again let alone the crazy ending
MMA,not_removed,the tour leading up to this fight was epic
MMA,not_removed,that pop when mcgregor snatches the belt
MMA,not_removed,that press conference was entertaining i liked when the little kid asked conor how long it will take him to rip aldos head off
MMA,not_removed,holly shit that crushed aldos spirit
MMA,not_removed,power play
MMA,not_removed,nah probably not its mma dude in years well have a new guy who brings in all new fans and youll be an old jaded mcgregor fan reminding the younguns about an era they missed
MMA,not_removed,dude was beat before the fight started never seen aldo that shaken
MMA,not_removed,i can agree and disagree with your comment sure every years you have a brock gsp jones rousey mcgregor figure but conor is just so fucking unique and incredible as a whole package that i doubt we will see another man like him in the short term his events feel like nothing else loudest crowd ever in dublin ufc was just unbelievably special that you felt privileged to have even witnessed it his incredible performance against aldo with him holding his own presser that unbelievable week before ufc where shit went crazy and id come home from school everyday and have new interviews with nate and conor talking shit the retirement tweet and ufc and were so goddamn entertaining at the end of the day his job is to entertain us and if one things for sure is that these past years have been entertaining as fuck
MMA,not_removed,well no he simply tried to feint the right to land his left and succeeded but mcgregors expert counterpunching reads reflexes and power clipped his chin just before aldo connected with him im pretty sure aldo was fine
MMA,not_removed,true story mind controls everything its more powerful than physical strength or technique
MMA,not_removed,people said all that about brock gsp and chuck there will be another there always is
MMA,not_removed,yeah im sure he wasnt dude just never lead that much hes done that same combo a bunch but never that early
MMA,not_removed,but the most exciting thing is all those guys are so different which leads me to think we wont see anyone quite like conor again
MMA,not_removed,no no ones gonna be exactly like conor next guy or girl is gonna be their own type of star and people are gonna call them the biggest ever shits cyclical
MMA,not_removed,the tldr here is that lawler did indeed have some suspicious numbers but theat no ped was identified and that the burden of proof required to take disciplinary action was not met the results remain suspicious and people are free to make up their own minds on the matter
MMA,not_removed,if he got off roids would he be juiceless robbie lawler
MMA,not_removed,theyre all on steroids
MMA,not_removed,alright while that explains why he was able to fight without serious repercussions it still leaves a couple questions and shows why we really need usada for their thoroughness
MMA,not_removed,basically everyone is just taking very quickly metabolizing versions of steroidspct drugs these days they probably inject daily small doses multiple times and are clean by the next morning
MMA,not_removed,i have another explanation than peds and people might think it sounds crazy but its more plausible than you might initially think lawler was kicked very hard in the testicles during training camp so his blood test showed extremely high luteinizing hormone levelsthe hormone that makes you produce more testosterone yet his testosterone level was completely normal and was still normal weeks later see when you actually use anabolics to increase your testosterone it decreases your lh levels rather than increase them because your body thinks you are naturally producing all that testosterone the luteinizing hormone levels will go very low like in the case of jones vitor weidman probably more that i havent seen the test results on especially for longterm steroid use the lh levels would go very low jones was tested at a mluml while lawlers showed mluml now the most common reason for lh levels to go completely off the charts high such as mluml would be damage to the testicles otherwise were looking at things like radiation chromosome abnormalities from birth testicular cancer peds in men are not linked to increasing lh levels their normal state anabolics dont estrogen blockers dont and especially not when the testosterone level is still completely within normal range now the fact that his lh levels were off the charts high testosterone levels normal and lh levels back to normal after weeks i present the suggestion that somebody nailed lawler with a hard as fuck kick to the testicles causing some short term damage right around the test
MMA,not_removed,i would really like to hear chime in on this he might have some insight as he is very knowledgeable on this type of bloodwork
MMA,not_removed,lol jones has suspicious numbers for sure on ped lawler did and everyone is like nah man cant be
MMA,not_removed,everyone is on steroids nate diaz
MMA,not_removed,lawler trains near the beach and got better in his mid who doesnt think he does steroids
MMA,not_removed,come on we dont want fair we want the biggest strongest and fastestand when you add steroids to the worlds best athletes thats what we get
MMA,not_removed,linked article no evidence of peds rmma lawler totally on peds i have no opinion or idea of whether lawler is on peds or not and no fighter testing positive would surprise me but the witchunting shitposters itt and everyone upvoting them are all literally cancer
MMA,not_removed,it shouldnt shock anyone lawler is on gear guy goes rounds harder than anyone and still looks like hee in his except for his growing head
MMA,not_removed,so i only dabble in hematology could someone give me a tldr on this shit
MMA,not_removed,im surprised robbie hasnt come out and addressed this on twitter then again hes not very active on social media so probably doesnt give a shit
MMA,not_removed,we all knew robbie was on that good stuff
MMA,not_removed,why do people care about this there is argument against peds if you actually understand what drugs are useful to the sport and what is available and how dirt cheap they are the playing field is not level without them it is not level with them you just see better fights and better fighters with them thats it health is hardly an argument when these guys jobs are to beat the shit out of each other fighting sports have so much idiotic tradition and superstition
MMA,not_removed,as someone who knows nothing about this i would be interested to know if he got off something on the how quickly your body would return to normal as they retested almost weeks later
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy is clearly on peds you know that scene in the matrix where neo is in the machine for hours he comes out and says i know kung fu that is what wonderboy does for his camp
MMA,not_removed,cheated and got away with it cos they cant prove it
MMA,not_removed,interesting what happens if a champion pops for something banned btw stripped of title and two contenders fight it out for the belt by default has that ever even happened cant think of a time it has off the top of my head
MMA,not_removed,the low hcthgb count and elevated reticulocytes are a lot more suspicious than the lh in my opinion he doesnt have a ridiculous physique as some have said but his cardio in later rounds could definitely be a result of blood doping lawlers postfight tests show absolutely no signs of increased blood volume or any other abnormal blood work the article basically just dismisses that as a possibility without addressing the fact that he obviously lost blood during the fight
MMA,not_removed,in other words he can afford the good shit
MMA,not_removed,im getting pretty sick of reading that my favourite fighters are all probably juiced to the gills
MMA,not_removed,i am relieved motherfuckers
MMA,not_removed,i love how people jump straight to conclusion no questions asked
MMA,not_removed,downvote all you want but i think its bullshit that mma fighters get so much more flack compared to other athletes when it comes to peds when just about every other pro athlete out there uses peds
MMA,not_removed,so basically what im finding with usada is more guys get caught but lots of the higher levels guys get suspicious results that then get tested again and everything is ok kinda reads like usada is getting beat a lot but now we are given more info on it
MMA,not_removed,eww bloody elbow fuck that shit i aint clicking that
MMA,not_removed,late career post resurgence crazy physique insane round cardio and the fact that he trains at att tells me all i need to know that said still love and respect the shit out of him as a fighter because how can you not edit okay his body doesnt look that freaky recently especially in the condit fight he looked a bit softer but doesnt that point to the usada effect as well
MMA,not_removed,tldr his other test all came back in normal range think thats important
MMA,not_removed,i dont know anything about peds and how they are used but i have a bit of a theory guys like jones and brock have been caught with banned supps ie clomid but not actual steroids right from what i understand clomid is something that you take at the end of a cycle to reduce your bodies estrogen and restart your natural testosterone system and guys like lawler have had suspicious results for a while now my theory is that these top fighters have access to new or designer peds that usada isnt aware of or can test for yet there is a multi billion dollar industry dedicated to people playing a sport at a higher level than everyone else while ped testing is funded by what so the top guys like jones brock lawler have access to the best peds around but they still risk getting popped for the other supps needed for maintenance like clomid
MMA,not_removed,so you mean theres no evidence of any wrong doing despite what rory and the rest of reddit were saying yesterday well i am shocked
MMA,not_removed,toothless maybe
MMA,not_removed,youre on steroids
MMA,not_removed,and if you believe these athletes are on a designer product that increases test the lawler jones and lesnar results would only help confirm the suspicion
MMA,not_removed,this is why they should implement the carbon isotope ratio test it determines if the testosterone in your system is natural or synthetic
MMA,not_removed,now this is the analysis i come to rmma for
MMA,not_removed,so if i punch my own balls very hard i can increase my lh which will increase my testosterone i can get ripped as fuck and sing a few tones higher with only a baseball bat thanks mate from now on life will be great
MMA,not_removed,no the test was definitely not done during his cycle it was done postcycle taking drugs like nolvadex and clomid would kickstart his balls into creating testosterone again naturally thats why his lh level could be skyrocketed you are correct on a cycle his lh would realistically be but he wasnt tested on his cycle also backed up by his normal testosterone level
MMA,not_removed,jones tested positive for clomid and letrozole unless he secretly has breast cancer he was caught trying to return his testosterone producing hormones back to normal after a cycle he was caught it wasnt suspicion it seems to be the same case for robbie the only difference being robbie didnt test positive for any substances any person who understands a blood test specifically lh levels in relation to test levels knows its not right people nowadays need concrete evidence or they will turn a blind eye robbie doesnt pass the smell test he comes from a shady camp and had a late career resurgence where he seemed indestructable now this its pretty obvious at this point
MMA,not_removed,nah loads of people here had suspicions about lawlers career resurgence innocent until proven guilty though hes never pissed hot im certainly not in any hurry to discredit him
MMA,not_removed,from what ive seen most are saying theyve suspected robbie for a while and that this doesnt come as a surprise
MMA,not_removed,eh lots of people were dubious back when jooes had those crazylow te levels and most people on here now think lawler has probably juiced lawler has always been pretty suspect he had a midcareer surge where he suddenly became worldclass which is always suspicious also jones numbers were a lot more suspicious
MMA,not_removed,ive suspected lawler for a long while now he had a career fall out and didnt look the same physically or fighting ability when he was just a little bit younger didnt he have a few training partners fail too
MMA,not_removed,people who constantly accuse lawler are just people with high sodium levels because he beat their favorite fighters cant take em seriously
MMA,not_removed,come on man i suppose its because of a conspiracy to keep the powerful black champion out of the mix
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt though he goes for one round and coasts until the usually
MMA,not_removed,robbies lh level the hormone that stimulates testosterone production was insanely high before ufc like silly high most likely case is he came off of a cycle and was nearing the end of his postcycle therapy during the test his testosterone levels were already back to normal thanks to taking something like nolvadex or clomid what jones popped for but his lh levels were still skyrocketed from these drugs which necessarily doesnt mean hes cheating but makes it fairly likely nsac is supposed to do follow up tests for something like a high lh like robbie had to test for these drugs since it is most likely the case why his level was so high but it seems like they either didnt or waited too long to do the followup tests
MMA,not_removed,no reason to volunteer any information if no conclusive evidence was found
MMA,not_removed,is this copy pasta
MMA,not_removed,probably used blockers or something
MMA,not_removed,imagine that its almost as if they base this shit on scientific evidence and not on what the internet thinks
MMA,not_removed,josh barnett for sure that i remember i think tim sylvia too
MMA,not_removed,more like tons of questions asked really
MMA,not_removed,i would say im not sure why youre getting downvoted but this is rmma
MMA,not_removed,youre on steroids
MMA,not_removed,roganesque in their questioning everything joe
MMA,not_removed,i think its a much bigger deal in combat sports where two people are inflicting physical harm against each other in other sports the juicers may be able to hit more homeruns or have greater endurance while pedaling a bike but in mma it can cause serious injury or death the first pedrelated death will cause a major shit storm and could end up killing the sport
MMA,not_removed,i guess most other pro athlete dont pound the others in the face until a ref steps in that the difference i see lance armstrong did not cause physical trauma greater than normal because he was on peds same argument could be made for nfl players though since they are concussing each other left and right
MMA,not_removed,what makes you think that most professional athletes probably play football soccer as theres a professional league in pretty much all developed nations in the world and the sport is fairly lucrative even at lower levels testing is generally poor but even before the ufc started testing fighters were more frequently getting caught than professional footballers are
MMA,not_removed,clomiphene doubles total testosterone levels in healthy individuals due to its ability to block estrogen in the pituitary which increases lh production the traditional use of clomiphene was only as part of pct over the last or so years it has become popular among elite athletes for use as a way to boost testosterone temporarily without negatively impacting long term endocrine function just because you dont know anyone who has used clomiphene as a solo ped doesnt mean no one is edit heres some poorly researched sources showing the effect on both men with normal t levels and with low to lownormal levels
MMA,not_removed,but woodley is older and his physique is more extreme than lawler what does that tell you
MMA,not_removed,is his physique really that crazy he looks pretty tame compared to most people that fail the smell test
MMA,not_removed,crazy physique ubereem had a crazy physique
MMA,not_removed,because how can you not peds
MMA,not_removed,that said still love and respect the shit out of him as a fighter because how can you not to me if someone cheats that all the respect is off the table
MMA,not_removed,not that significant really his suspicious result was consistent with him being at the end of a cycle unsurprisingly his followup results were normal either because he had now finished his post cycle therapy or because he was always clean history also teaches us that known ped user can produce many normal results before ever getting caught
MMA,not_removed,its certainly a game of cat and mouse with usada so maybe some fighters do have access to designer peds that are as yet undetectable i think a lot of it is simply structuring a dosing plan with conventional peds in such a way the window in which an athlete would test positive is minimized
MMA,not_removed,there is evidence of wrong doing just not enough to be sure that isnt the same as no evidence
MMA,not_removed,its not that theres no evidence of wrong doing simply that there is insufficient evidence to meet usadas burden of proof thankfully usada sets the bar pretty high to avoid punishing the innocent but that inevitably lets a lot of guilty go free
MMA,not_removed,ever since they banned wrestling footwear in the octagon hes been shoeless robbie lawler
MMA,not_removed,toothless rippy lipler
MMA,not_removed,im on steroids
MMA,not_removed,thats beatable too animalderived testosterone will not be caught by a cir test i also think it wouldnt catch microdosing quickly metabolizing drugs
MMA,not_removed,they already do if the results are suspicious nevada did a cir test on joness december out of competition tests it came back clean
MMA,not_removed,no youve misread if you punch yourself hard enough in the balls they will produce less testosterone than they should then your pituitary gland starts creating mass levels of lh so that your testosterone production can remain normal like lawlers
MMA,not_removed,i mean its definitely a possibility i just thought it was funny to blame it on a nutshot since its a legit medical explanation however ulikely it is and the thing is youre right that both serms like nolvaclomid aswell as ais would increase your lh level but the purpose is to kickstart your test production after it drops horribly low post cycle usually you would see extremely low te ratio t level aswell as lh level after a cycle say you take clomid here it indeed would spike your lh levels but rather than spiking it from a normal level to normal it would spike it from an extremely small level to somewhere around normal level take jbj as an example when he was caught with a suspicious test in his lh level was at mluml and using a sermai post cycle would be able to boost him back into the normal range of mluml rather than from the normal level to mluml
MMA,not_removed,this is not correct while clomid can be used to control estrogen on cycle it is not commonly used for that as drugs like arimidex and aromasin are more effective as aromatize inhibitors effectively halving the free estrogen in the human body instead of blocking it from binding to receptors clomid and letrozole are taken as a post cycle therapy to kickstart the dormant natural endocrine system that is shutdown from anabolic steroid use the drugs effectively wake up the lh and fsh hormones to help accelerate the bodies natural testosterone production granted these drugs will also prevent any free estrogen from binding to receptors as coming off of synthetic testosterone will cause an increase in free estrogen in the body clomid only blocks the estrogen from binding it cannot remove it from the body like aromatize inhibitor drugs do
MMA,not_removed,i think we all know jones testosterone was jacked from street racing not peds
MMA,not_removed,we as a justice system for example have always required concrete evidence to convict the court of public opinion however will easily draw their own conclusionsas evidenced by this sub sherdog etc i dont think people who follow the sport are turning a blind eye so much as we cant punish based on speculation
MMA,not_removed,apparently joness test is bullshit so i cant say he pissed hot yet
MMA,not_removed,but i mean jones was never actually caught using any ped right
MMA,not_removed,think youre right
MMA,not_removed,im white and idgaf just calling it like i see it its the fan reaction
MMA,not_removed,oh he was gone in one round alright
MMA,not_removed,that was exactly what i was looking for thank you much
MMA,not_removed,except that lh goes down when you take steroids
MMA,not_removed,no just most of the people into sports in fact most people are idiots
MMA,not_removed,its pretty cool to see a specific case scenario as in usada tested for this saw this and this tested him again and saw that but at the end of the day it was on the upper end of normal and he didnt test for anything banned man i wish i could read these reports accurately cos id be balls deep in these results if i knew what they were saying
MMA,not_removed,as it should be of course he should get away with it if it cant be proven Â¯ãÂ¯ and maybe hes innocent i actually find it very surprising how many people get caught i used to think itd be impossible to catch someone who was smart about how they cheated but i guess i was wrong
MMA,not_removed,haha thank you apparently its been confirmed by rmma that lawler is on steroids
MMA,not_removed,everybody does steroids
MMA,not_removed,dude he walks around almost the same weight as luke rockhold on a diet and hes thats fucking crazy no wonder hes a round fighter
MMA,not_removed,didnt they both train at att
MMA,not_removed,no way bro woodley would never do steroids he aint part of this witch hunt bro only guys whose last names start with l would take roids lawler lesnar joe rogan same difference man
MMA,not_removed,black dont crack
MMA,not_removed,but his cardio massively sucks i guarantee you will never see an energized woodley in round
MMA,not_removed,please do not flame as not trying to be racist at all but i find that in general black people have an easier time building muscle and maintaining a low body fat than any other race many of them are genetically blessed in terms of athletics and tyrone is simply a freak athlete also the darker your skin the more muscle definition becomes apparent this is the case with white people too tan peoples muscles show more than a pale person with a similar musculature robbie is pretty tan though so this isnt a big deal in their case that being said would not be surprised at all to find out that he or anybody else is juicing
MMA,not_removed,that some people are just genetically more muscular
MMA,not_removed,theyre all on steroids
MMA,not_removed,woodley isnt older in fight years and doesnt have cardio what does that tell you
MMA,not_removed,they both train at att
MMA,not_removed,also trained at att hmmm
MMA,not_removed,black dont crack
MMA,not_removed,bbc genetics
MMA,not_removed,overeem overeem woah nice body
MMA,not_removed,people talk about his wins like he was blowing people out of the water he knocked out ellenberger which in hindsight wasnt that big of a deal he lost a close fight to hendricks and was arguably gifted a win in the second fight his fight against mcdonald he was close to being finished himself and was down on the score cards up until cracking rorys nose for the final time his fight against condit you can make the case that he lost
MMA,not_removed,thats just not true lawler has always been consistent heres two ways lawler has not been consistent lawler moves to strikeforce goes during his years there never able to string together more than w in a row moves to the ufc goes in the next years heres the difference between robbie lawler in strikeforce and robbie lawler in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,put me on peds and i still cant do a tenth of the shit he does
MMA,not_removed,lol people are actually downvoting you
MMA,not_removed,or the claim a while back that he randomly would assult people in hs and steal their beer
MMA,not_removed,but he never tested positive ever
MMA,not_removed,this is it theres no need for exotic designer steroids there are products on the market already that will be undetectable by the morning
MMA,not_removed,evidence that points to potential wrong doing is not the same as evidence that points to wrong doing no conclusion we cant justly say wrong was done
MMA,not_removed,i remember when he lost that hard fought decision against hendricks he was fruitless robbie lawler
MMA,not_removed,it is actually very hard to beat it is specifically used to catch cases of micro dosing
MMA,not_removed,well yeah if there are no metabolites to detect you arent going to come up dirty doesnt mean you were clean just means you were clean when training just when you got blood taken
MMA,not_removed,awwwww everything sucks
MMA,not_removed,yes i failed to mention clomid is taken in pct alongside something like a nolvadex since clomid imo isnt worth it anyway too strong of sides for too little effect which is why i was confused with jones test same goes for letrozole i always was under the assumption it was a lastresort kind of thing because of its overall less effectiveness than other drugs i suppose i should reread myself before submitting thanks for clearing that up man
MMA,not_removed,good writeup i think autocorrect changed aromatase to aromatize a couple of times for those not aware aromatase is the enzyme that peripherally in the blood stream and body tissues turns some of the androgens into estrogens
MMA,not_removed,he takes the stairs whenever he can too
MMA,not_removed,i think youre actually spot on
MMA,not_removed,technically you are correct but what he popped for was still banned and is of the time used handinhand with peds which is where the trouble comes from
MMA,not_removed,huh did you miss him being pulled from ufc due to failed tests or are you being sarcastic
MMA,not_removed,there was a significant difference between the two situations
MMA,not_removed,correct lh goes to aka your balls shrink and are completely useless while cycling most likely robbie was tested towards the end of his postcycle therapy several weeks after his actual cycle has ended which is why the lh level would be skyrocketed during his pct hes taking something like a nolva or clomid or both to stimulate his lh level into producing test again because your balls just dont start producing their normal testosterone levels on their own again they need help thats why it would be insanely high like on his suspicious test these drugs are overcompensating rebooting his lh and fsh levels
MMA,not_removed,you were right but usada do things differently
MMA,not_removed,if youre not being randomly tested and a lot of guys arentwerent its better for you to take something like clomid between fights you get to double your test for weeks its undetectable a few weeks later and you dont need to take anything postcycle to return your levels to normal it was basically a free way to train harder and get more benefit between fights without having to do a second cycle of something else afterwards to get your shit back to normal plus clomid etc is out of your system much faster than the steroids most guys can get their hands on microdoses of pure testosterone were difficult to get a hold of for a long time there and if you got a dodgy batch with another steroid you might end up detectable for months add the fact that most tests in mma were urine only for a long time and cir testing is the best way to fail for exogenous test and clomid made a lot of sense bear in mind guys training in mma arent necessarily looking for the kind of boost guys in bodybuilding weightlifting etc are doubling your t so you can go full tilt in your two a days every day is a massive benefit for guys at the top of the sport
MMA,not_removed,every thread there are hundreds of upvotes on similar comments and yet every thread it needs to be said again everyone is on gear your favorite fighter that guy who always bitches about other fighters using champions theyre all current or past users
MMA,not_removed,youre on steroids
MMA,not_removed,pretty much
MMA,not_removed,ur on steroids
MMA,not_removed,i think its a bit extreme to label all fighters as cheats if you consider peds as cheating i actually believe many that say they are clean many lie as well but not all
MMA,not_removed,they both train at att but at different locations so kind of
MMA,not_removed,lon lones
MMA,not_removed,thats rayyyysisssssst
MMA,not_removed,calm down megan
MMA,not_removed,physique can be very misleading anyway josh barnett failed three tests the first two back when the tests were easily beatable and never looked particularly good even for a natural im sure there are plenty of guys whove used that no one would ever suspect by looking at them and probably a few guys that fail the smell test that are actually clean
MMA,not_removed,whoa fedors lats are godlike
MMA,not_removed,i think it is also important to at least be mindful of his age his level of endurance training his density when weighing in and smaller things like those they all dont really add up at least in terms of agesmell test nate diaz looking slim and having good cardio with his physique at years old is very understandable
MMA,not_removed,glad im not the only person who doesnt see this crazy roided physique
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,very fantastic body
MMA,not_removed,strikeforce ufc return wow so youre telling me he lost weight when he dropped down in weight classes holy shit what a revelation lawler should be suspended immediately
MMA,not_removed,i think robbie is undergoing the best chemo the world has ever known
MMA,not_removed,biceps look just as big abs are less pronounced because he was a mw meaning less cut not saying hes not doping but some comparison pics that dont take into account the whole picture are not proof
MMA,not_removed,didnt he fight in mw in strikeforce hes lbs heavier in the strikeforce picture compared to the ufc ones
MMA,not_removed,because you didnt train and that doesnt change that hes a cheater and personally i dont respect cheaters especially in a sport where you hit each other in the head
MMA,not_removed,this is the same subreddit that claims anderson silva isnt that great because he took peds people here have issues
MMA,not_removed,this sub will vote depending who you are accusing of peds
MMA,not_removed,as long as they were entertained by his fights they give their total respect sportsmanship general fairness hard work and skill dont matter
MMA,not_removed,exactly what i just said
MMA,not_removed,were all on steroids
MMA,not_removed,animalderived testosterone while a bit more expensive will still beat it though edit also there are other sources of test that will beat it as well and you can alter your diet so your ratios will still pass the cir test supposedly
MMA,not_removed,it is actually very hard to beat labs have sources on the inside of testing agencies they know what tech is being developed and what it is designed to do they will develop drugs designed to beat advanced detection methods its just a big cat and mouse game
MMA,not_removed,what are you talking about a cir only detects if testosterone in your system is natural or synthetic you always have testosterone in your system
MMA,not_removed,shouldve read that before you slammed your nuts
MMA,not_removed,yeah jones made bad choices doesnt mean we should try and assume the worst from now on
MMA,not_removed,only problem is he was tested for serms ais and passed those tests plus his testosterone andro etc was definitely on the high end of normal in the tests
MMA,not_removed,theres no way theres not a single fighter who isnt using or hasnt used that there can be so many fighters to compete in the ufc and not a single one of them would have an aversion to cheating would be statistically astronomical and if even one guy isnt cheating its unfair fuck every cheater the everyone is using thing is getting used as an excuse around here each time a popular fighter tests positive or looks suspicious id bet that the vast majority of guys to compete in the ufc have used peds but theres just no way its of all fighters
MMA,not_removed,i dont think people know how prevalent different means of peds are at gyms especially with this new sarmsermpeptide craze bringing still street legal compounds into the mix
MMA,not_removed,save perhaps the lowest classes dj and jj are on the cutting edge of training and development but unlikely i imagine gear theyre both cardio fighters particularly joanna who has mt fights all over the world to show for it
MMA,not_removed,your face is on steroids
MMA,not_removed,lory lickdonald
MMA,not_removed,wery
MMA,not_removed,he definitely looks more ripped without the fat
MMA,not_removed,that doesnt change that hes a cheater actually there is no complete proof that he is a cheater that is what this article is saying if you actually read it
MMA,not_removed,ya hes probably a cheater who didnt get caught full in a sport full of cheaters who dont get caught yet you single out dislike for him care to elaborate
MMA,not_removed,im kinda laughing at how people saying they would still respect lawler even if hes on peds but then you have jon jones lombard romero cyborg etc that get shit on lol there are even fighters who have never popped that get hate because of the eye test
MMA,not_removed,if you are caught using peds you rightly disqualify yourself from the list by the end of the top list will contain fighters
MMA,not_removed,dont you ever ever dare suggest its unfair to claim hendricks was juiced up but gsp wasnt do not do it
MMA,not_removed,yam derived test does that count as a detectable synthetic or does it show up as natural because its organic
MMA,not_removed,can you verify it exists on the market er black market i thought that was hypothetical and never actually in production
MMA,not_removed,yeah exactly so if youve metabolized your synthetic test short esters low does microdosing all day etc your cir will come up clean or if you use animal derived test or some other steroid that is faster metabolizing andor doesnt have a different carbon isotope
MMA,not_removed,the two drugs have a synergistic effect when used together for pct
MMA,not_removed,this was nsac also though and not usada theyve had plenty of mishaps in the past he definitely could have passed these tests as well especially with atts own testing that they did ie the lombard fiasco which made them look even more shady
MMA,not_removed,unless its virtually impossible not to take banned substances you have the nfl telling players not to eat meat in other countries half the stuff in gnc has banned substances in it cold medicine caffeine dhea etc etc doesnt sound that absurd not to mention that doctors prescribe all kinds of banned substances to nonathletes i would bet that of the people youve ever worked with have taken banned substances
MMA,not_removed,the types of people who arent users are like cody mckenzie do you remember his skinny pasty unatheletic ass thats mma without any performance enhancers but youre right im rounding up from like of long term mma fighters using or having used but its safer to assume user than clean
MMA,not_removed,being on the cutting edge often means using things that arent known substances to the testers and community like the first athletes to do epo and hgh were like hey man im not taking any steroids so im clean im not saying that dj and jj are out there shooting up a cocktail of shit once a day just that they most likely have at some point in their careers used something that we would consider a banned substance in order to help themselves jj is from eastern europe and dj i dont care if my opponents are cheating or not quotes dont make me think either is the exception to this but i will say i doubt either of them are currently anywhere near any banned substances just that they have done them in the past
MMA,not_removed,to be fair though cyclists never looked like they were juiced and that sport was dirtier than baseball there are drugs one could take to increase endurance and keep you from turning into palhares
MMA,not_removed,your mom goes to college
MMA,not_removed,and they never caught lance armstrong the dude had to confess about his steroid use just because there is not enough evidence to actually discipline people doesnt mean that they did nothing wrong
MMA,not_removed,i single out those who either got caught or have other results pointing to them almost certainly using im open to hear what else you think could be the reason for his results because i am not very well read up on the subject source that the sport is full of cheaters obviously theres been many but full
MMA,not_removed,and i never said anything about lists people act like he isnt that great of a fighter because he took peds you could inject these keyboard warriors with a million dollars in peds and they wouldnt be half the fighter that a ufc fighter is
MMA,not_removed,hendricks just made it painfully obvious
MMA,not_removed,pharmaceutical testosterone is derived from a plant base eg soy or yams
MMA,not_removed,yams are what they make test out of
MMA,not_removed,i cannot verify that it exists but i wouldnt be shocked if it did
MMA,not_removed,in other words you just declared the cir test as useless while the other guy is praising it as the silver bullet to catch cheaters
MMA,not_removed,cir test are harder to beat because they dont rely on a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone it compares the carbon make up of the testosterone itself pharmaceutical testosterone usually plant based has less carbon to carbon the testosterone we naturally produce is the opposite higher carbon to carbon
MMA,not_removed,it was the nac but the test was a wada partial menu performed by smrtl in salt lake city which is one of wada accredited labs in the us usada regularly use it as well not to say theres no possibility he was cheating but if he was i would have expected the elevated lh test to also pop for a ped metabolite
MMA,not_removed,i think this is the real issue how many bans can usada make before they just give out a list of things athletes can use or until athletes are only allowed to buy from usada as a middle man people are only gonna come up with more complex ways of cheating as technology advances were gonna have issues on deciding on whats cheating as well as an even bigger list of things to test for
MMA,not_removed,you have a really low standard for athleticism if you literally believe that
MMA,not_removed,why cody mckenzie though im not a top level athlete so it might not compare but i look way athletic and muscular then he does and ive never used its almost facetious to say thats mma without peds
MMA,not_removed,id put my estimate at or above as well to be honest in hindsight guys like mckenzie if he iswas clean deserve a lot of credit i think thats my main problem with labeling the entire roster as ped users the few guys who really are clean wont get the credit they truly deserve the sad thing is well never truly know how good some of these guys are if mckenzie was fighting clean against ped users hes better than hell ever get credit for being
MMA,not_removed,lance partially confessed only after he was sanctioned by usada and the evidence was unequivocal failed tests from previous years and countless witness testimony
MMA,not_removed,guilty until proven innocent thats shit logic
MMA,not_removed,armstrong wasnt on steroids he was on epo
MMA,not_removed,common sense is the source how would clean athletes compete in a field with tons of athletes who are seeking every advantage they can get dont foold yourself into thinking fighters you like and support are clean because theyve never popped
MMA,not_removed,my post was mostly a joke getting caught cheating should get you off the list but when everyone gets caught your list gets pretty short
MMA,not_removed,gsp didnt
MMA,not_removed,they arent useless but they can be easily beat these days and going back decades in all honesty if you know what you are doing
MMA,not_removed,yup i know this but as i stated earlier they are still easy to be with animal lab bacteria produced testosterone or many of the numerous other steroids out there that people are using
MMA,not_removed,nolvadex increases testosterone production period yes there is a synergistic effect with clomid during a pct not even worth the time explaining anything to you nolvadex does a lot more than just prevent estrogen from binding to breast tissue receptors i guess the fact that it is used in pretty much every pct plan is just a waste of the drug have fun using clomid solo coming off a heavy cycle and see how that works out for you the clomid doses would be so high that the side effects would be unbearable clearly you have zero understanding of the negative feedback estrogens have on the hypothalamus and stimulation for heightened release of gnrh lh output by pituitary is increased which in turn effects the testes testosterone production the two drugs are very closely related people make the mistake at assuming clomid is the superior drug for stimulating testosterone when in fact nolvadex is more effective looking at the two drugs separately mg of nolvadex will have the same effect on increased testosterone production as a staggering mg dose of clomid
MMA,not_removed,exactly
MMA,not_removed,thats practically the logic of modern day media
MMA,not_removed,i never said he was guilty i just said that because they only have of the evidence needed for a suspension doesnt mean he wasnt doing anything again look at lance armstrong that guy beat every test thrown at him but we now know for a fact edit thanks to a confession that he was using epo so to restate like lance just because robbie wasnt caught doesnt mean he didnt do shit
MMA,not_removed,hes used testosterone epo hgh cortisone and illegal blood transfusion by his own admission
MMA,not_removed,epo is a ped not every ped is a steroid
MMA,not_removed,conor nate maia
MMA,not_removed,because theyre smarter andor more skilled i know a fuckton the vast majority of fighters were on gear preusada or simply used things that have since been banned like trt but i dont believe every single person was and i certainly know that most dont now if some of the biggest stars in the sport pop and half the roster look visibly smaller most guys arent using
MMA,not_removed,in regards to the drug test challenge thing nope
MMA,not_removed,agree if youre trying to do a solid pct with just clomid youll have a rough couple of months side effects arent worth it it would be silly to not run tamoxifen and if you really needed it throwing clomid on top of it
MMA,not_removed,how do you know those people are clean i mean i would assume nate and maia most likely are but i dont know put aside everything you love about conor and just look at him look at how he grew in muscle mass and the time he did it in it would not at all be unreasonable to think hes juiced big time
MMA,not_removed,i wish i could be as naive as you my friend theyre all on something
MMA,not_removed,dude nates and nicks cardio does not say clean at all
MMA,not_removed,he sure can talk into the wind if thats the case
MMA,not_removed,you could well be right i dont doubt that anyone is on something
MMA,not_removed,conor is fantastic but he hasnt wiped out the division he has zero title defenses i think a rematch with aldo or holloway even fights with edgar or pettis are fantastic fights
MMA,not_removed,conor has beaten of the ranked featherweights basically wiped out the division i see
MMA,not_removed,khabib
MMA,not_removed,youre gonna get some he didnt clear out the whole division comments
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,wiped out the fw division frankie edgar full camp chad swanson jeremy stephens hell id like to see him fight holloway again since theyve both came miles along since the first fight edit forgot about pettis and in a few years i think oliviera will be legit too plus the cruz superfight that was rumored
MMA,not_removed,theres not much left for him at featherweight just rematches and with the trend of undeserving title shots edgar pettis is also a fresh challenge at personally i would love a aldo vs pettis fight theyre were talks of them fighting before but mcgregor at lightweight he just beat the ranked lightweight and his the current fedderweight champion i want him to go for the second belt alvarez vs mcgregor might even be more crazier than the diaz fights and cerrone should fight lawler imo cerrone isnt even that good at shit talking
MMA,not_removed,i think conor doesnt belong in featherweight he hits way to hard i think rumble doesnt belong in light heavyweight he hits way to hard see how that statement stops making sense when you swap conor with another hard hitter
MMA,not_removed,til siver short notice chad and aldo are the whole division
MMA,not_removed,cant forget about lamas or bermudez creeping up the rankings too
MMA,not_removed,i agree on both counts id love to see a holloway rematch i think it could go very differently than the first go around
MMA,not_removed,i came here to say the same he hasnt wiped out the division aldo edgar pettis holloway should be fights he must do plus up and coming talent like doo ho choi yair or artem lobov if he leaves the division now he wont be a true champ just a what if also as dana said there are not many wars the body can take maybe itd be smarter to go down to win more fights and preserve the body even brian ortega at some point if he keeps winning
MMA,not_removed,as he should hasnt fought frankie and a few other top contenderspettis being one now and max is a different beast than he was while mendes and aldo are good wins id hardly consider it cleared out
MMA,not_removed,and poirier and holloway although im not sure why im responding to a butthurt diaz fanboy
MMA,not_removed,or stephens thatd be a crazy fight
MMA,not_removed,lamas isnt creeping up any rankings these days
MMA,not_removed,dustin is an alright win as well not cleared out the top worthy but its certainly a solid win and seeing as aldo had already beaten every other top fighter when mcgregor beat dustin i think it was a smart move to give him a title shot when that happened what really bothers me is when people say dustin is a different animal at lw like op hes looked good because he has always been good he fucked up people outside the top at fw in spectacular fashion
MMA,not_removed,well he kinda didnt
MMA,not_removed,lol could you tell me what clearing out the division means then max holloway frankie edgar and an aldo rematch thats clearing out the divison
MMA,not_removed,beating those guys while they are ranked is hardly clearing anything then siver then short notice replacement then aldo aldo is the only legit win and only top opponent he has beat
MMA,not_removed,those guys are solid but i think theyre pretty clearly a tier below conor aldo holloway chad and frankie i suspect they will be gatekeepers for the new crop yair choi bektic ortega
MMA,not_removed,hes perennially been hovering around the top
MMA,not_removed,agreed there wasnt really another move to make at the time i just dont like people like op ignoring the rest of the top because aldo had best them etc thats just bad mma math if he comes back and beats aldo frankie max pettis or any combination like that sure call it cleared out but until then nope
MMA,not_removed,edgar just got humiliated by aldo why would he deserve a title shot
MMA,not_removed,poirier was ranked when they fought
MMA,not_removed,thats true but not creeping up the rankings in his last and his only win in the past years is against a washed up diego sanchez who drained himself dry to get to even if he went on a crazy streak no one wants to see mcgregor vs lamas hes clearly a step down from the top of the featherweight division
MMA,not_removed,yea it definitely isnt cleared out its hard to clear a division as a contender because contenders dont usually all face each other the company lets them get built up so they can have a good set of people to challenge the champion he never beat anyone twice never fought frankie cub lamas tkz doo ho choi those arent all world beaters but in the time conor defends or times potentially they could look like all stars
MMA,not_removed,maybe they ranked him higher to build conor up but he beat no one that deserved to rank him
MMA,not_removed,farewell this word what does it mean
MMA,not_removed,cro cops done more farewell tours than the eagles
MMA,not_removed,sage so my friend is a middle school football coach along with a co wrestling coach with yours truly he told him sage im the best year old coach youre the best year old fighter we can do something to which sage responded with oh my dad doesnt let me talk to coaches and winked at him also haha mickey is a really nice guy he means well jackson he just apologized profusely for how sweaty he was rockhold i forget the conversation but bisping is a dick was in there a few times javier was super happy and jumpy for whatever reason serra my friend told him he liked him more than nick the tooth he responded with i like you more than i like the tooth and complimented his collar tie maia apparently had a death grip johnson really confident poor guy they talked for like minutes about wrestling ariel they talked real quick before he said something about not wanting to be thrown out again also in the lobbies they chanted who the fook is that guy like minutes

MMA,not_removed,i was up there ran into helwani a few times that night
MMA,not_removed,hes adopted so like probably
MMA,not_removed,lol thats what i thought dana get better security
MMA,not_removed,his dad is a circle

MMA,not_removed,billy is a real personable guy he has the talent a lot of wrestlers have which is making friends quick lots of practice at tournaments
MMA,not_removed,wouldnt be surprised to find out that of fighter smoke better than pain killers
MMA,not_removed,he did get multiple awards in his highschool for making bongs disguised as regular sculptures
MMA,not_removed,i think hes trying to do the model face thing
MMA,not_removed,all you motherfuckers are on donuts
MMA,not_removed,my first thought was the pro wrestler samoa joe
MMA,not_removed,chubby khabib
MMA,not_removed,looks like a dj khaled that dropped a few pounds to me
MMA,not_removed,lol were only worthy of rampage vs machida but nothing else i guess
MMA,not_removed,that jumperhug combination man i wanna hug that guy
MMA,not_removed,he was our state ranked heavyweight boy didnt know a thing about cutting
MMA,not_removed,he met alvarez and didnt get a picture but youre still probably right
MMA,not_removed,basically he was a commanding force in the football program for years a few years back they needed assistants so he went to help he went like every day then was co coach and this year he was head coach hes real good lead his team to first undefeated season ever with the exception of the finals
MMA,not_removed,he didnt speak very good inglÃ©s
MMA,not_removed,he looks like a handsome old dad that was recently divorced and is now getting back into the dating game he could be in a just for men hair color commercial lmao
MMA,not_removed,look at it this way if i wouldve just had these stories people wouldve doubted me due to lack of evidence
MMA,not_removed,met bisping in the jacks beforehand chatted for close to mins on the main event no need for him to stay noone else was there kind of wished i has asked him for a pic
MMA,not_removed,better than an autograph imo
MMA,not_removed,im still unsure of whether hes selfaware or not
MMA,not_removed,he knows
MMA,not_removed,i didnt expect sage to be so quick witted
MMA,not_removed,he also beats me wink seriously wink help winks no seriously help in morse code
MMA,not_removed,eh he didnt do terribly defended a few takedowns in the second and lit him up in the first its just that once khabib grabs you its over it doesnt matter how good of a wrestler or fighter you are and mjs damn good
MMA,not_removed,joe
MMA,not_removed,billy said something like sage youre a cage fighter and was met with he really is a nice guy

MMA,not_removed,ryan hall going in on edmund once ronda retires hopefully everyone leaves his stupid ass gym
MMA,not_removed,it hasnt even been hours and caraway is already taking shots at cody
MMA,not_removed,before the round started erik looked and rivera and said we go hard
MMA,not_removed,the poorly timed holloway standoff
MMA,not_removed,they better not cut francisco his had back luck with of his losses not being legit the faber fight and the pickett fightand that guy fucking brings it
MMA,not_removed,madness
MMA,not_removed,perez putting on his cruz impression that was crazy
MMA,not_removed,my favorite fight of the night so entertaining i was going apeshit at the start of the third round
MMA,not_removed,crazy start to the round that was a bloodbath
MMA,not_removed,reminded me of the max holloway fight he wanted to bang
MMA,not_removed,except that doing it with a full round to go is pretty dumb
MMA,not_removed,they started seconds into last round and gassed for the remaining minutes heh that was weird
MMA,not_removed,no way he gets cut hes fireworks
MMA,not_removed,he puts on good fights think he could go before being cut
MMA,not_removed,they train together
MMA,not_removed,some impressive feetwork
MMA,not_removed,it was an amazing fight
MMA,not_removed,leonard garcia
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt call what erik did in the last minutes in that round gassed he dropped all kinds of damage from the top
MMA,not_removed,that wasnt gassed that was just erik controlling the fight
MMA,not_removed,that is losses for him now i just hope they respect people like francisco who give us what we want
MMA,not_removed,damnagreed i hope he stays too
MMA,not_removed,i really wish tj would get this fight in my eyes hes next in line dom will probably beat cody and after that i feel like tj learned enough from his cruz fight and can come back and edge out the decision hell he can probably knock cruz out in the later rounds if he takes care of cruzs legs early
MMA,not_removed,tj gets too much shit if you ask me but theres something about the guy that seems disingenuous maybe hes camera shy or maybe its just me
MMA,not_removed,i want to see you fight for the title tj
MMA,not_removed,calling it now if dodson wins in spectacular fashion then make dodson vs dillashaw and cruz vs garbrandt
MMA,not_removed,wow everybodys getting down voted up in this thread
MMA,not_removed,sorry tj nobody wants to see you fight for the title again bro
MMA,not_removed,tj should fight cody then fight don because dom is just sitting out at this point
MMA,not_removed,i dunno i find it hard to believe that dom wont also go into the fight knowing tj will be going for those leg kicks dom beat tj after being super rusty he looked fantastic against an albeit over the hill faber but i see dom winning the rematch easier than the first fight
MMA,not_removed,personally id rather see dom vs cody and then if dom wins vs tj i dont like quick rematches a little change of pace is nice its a bit unfair because it was that close of a fight i also get why tj wants it badly because getting champ money vs his contract now must be infuriating
MMA,not_removed,a few guys have alleged that hes an absolute asshole to train with and beats up inexperienced guys etc i dont know how true it is but i can see him being that way for sure
MMA,not_removed,nobody well i do so youre wrong buddeh
MMA,not_removed,shit i do
MMA,not_removed,are you kidding hes one of the most exciting fighters in that division and their first fight could have gone either way
MMA,not_removed,everyone but you want to see the rematch
MMA,not_removed,are you crazy their first fight was as close as a fight can be it was entertaining and very technical and competitive plus judging by the amount of downvotes you got a lot of people want to see it
MMA,not_removed,dude tj is one of the most exciting strikers in the sport what are you on about
MMA,not_removed,i agree tjs definitely the rightful number one contender but i would like to see this potential trilogy stretched out instead of rushing through it like cain vs jds
MMA,not_removed,i agree tj will get his title shot and he deserves it but lets add some variety to the bantamweight division while its up for grabs cruz vs cody is a fun fight and nows the time to make it
MMA,not_removed,this board is so backwards tj playing victim card
MMA,not_removed,dude was super nice when i met him my buddy grapples at mp with him and said hes always been a good dude since hes known him
MMA,not_removed,no it was very clearly for cruz
MMA,not_removed,hes one of the most exciting fighters in the ufc he always brings it
MMA,not_removed,i dont think so significant strikes were landed were within or fewer for every round and tjs were much harder strikes in general despite a lot of people arguing to the contrary this is supposed to be considered when scoring add to that tj was pushing the pace the entire fight landed more clinch strikes and got the only td its my opinion that tj should have won but to say it was a clear win for either fighter is ridiculous
MMA,not_removed,ok well you just proved you have no clue what your talking about cruz took down tj twice in a row and tj didnt get any take downs
MMA,not_removed,well i didnt want to rewatch a minute fight to confirm the specifics so i checked fm they had tj at one in the fourth and none for dom one thing to consider is that in order for a td to count you have to maintain control of your opponent for several seconds on the ground you can take somebody down all day but if you cant control then for a few seconds after then its not counted but fuck me i guess i dont know anything because an internet stranger was feeling standoffish and told me so edit i see what happened i was looking at the section of grounded sig strikes and thought i was saw it add td anyway tj is listed as getting a td in the fourth tj was only down by three strikes that round but was more aggressive and landed that td either way nothing really happened from any takedowns from either of them takedowns alone dont do much for your score because you have to actually do something with them like land strikes
MMA,not_removed,again watch the fight tj didnt take him down at all and cruz did hold him on the takedown
MMA,not_removed,see my edit they dont count for much if you dont do anything with them anyway fights are scored by effective striking grappling control and aggressiveness in that order striking was even but i do want to stress that quality of strikes ate supposed to affect the scoreharder strikes are weighed more which is why i think tj won considering thats first thing you must consider when scoring when the numbers are equal the harder hitter should get the nod according to the rules theyre wasnt much grappling aside from short lived takedowns which arent supposed to affect things much unless you can do something with them control is hard to say dom was floating around the ring the whole time so you cant really say he controlled it dom was great defensively and was always where he wanted to be but his style forces him to give up ground constantly tj pushed forward but wasnt really controlling much himself so then you arrive at aggressiveness and that easily goes to tj by a mile thats why i think its a close fight
MMA,not_removed,i think your mistaken on some of the scoring criteria but it was a close fight and everyones entitled to their opinion
MMA,not_removed,what i find interesting about these rules is that there are multiple official looking sources in several places that sometimes differ slightly i got my information from several interviews from guys like big john when hes explaining things to fighters backstage and several other people ill see if i can find sources after work
MMA,not_removed,ok
MMA,not_removed,see the ufcs site for a general overview of the rules httpwwwufccomdiscoversportrulesandregulations it doesnt really go in depth but you can see in sections about the order in which things are given priority striking is first and foremost for slightly more indepth info effective striking heavier strikes that have a visible impact on the opponent will be given more weight than the number of strikes landed and further down the page judged by determining the impact of legal strikes landed by a contestant and the number of such legal strikes heavier strikes that have a visible impact on the opponent will be given more weight than the number of strikes landed these assessments include causing an opponent to appear stunned from a legal blow causing the opponent to stagger appearance of a cut or bruise from a legal strike and causing the opponent to show pain cumulative impact on a fighter will also be weighed if neither fighter shows an advantage in impact of strikes the number of strikes will determine the most effective striker but this is where i also see contradicting information because on the ufcs site it says that striking is considered above all when scoring yet in my other link it clearly states that grappling and striking are given the same consideration striking and grappling are now considered to be given equal weight anyway heres some more info on how grappling is scored this is especially relevant because most of the fight was standing and striking the unified rules employ a sliding scale of importance when it comes to striking and grappling according to the abc mma judging committee if a round is affected more by striking then striking will be weighed more heavily if a round is affected more by grappling than grappling will be weighed more heavily in other words three minutes of striking exchanges should outweigh a broken minute of grappling on the scorecards this is just some quick info i could find like i said its interesting how you find different and sometimes conflicting info from seemingly official sources out there was there something specific you took issue with you didnt really say in your post so im kinda just going with what i can find right now
MMA,not_removed,i understand take downs are not a huge factor but i was thinking that you are underestimating how much they do weigh in on a fight especially when the striking is very close also i had issue with your assessment of that tjs strikes were more significant because im not sure if i agree with that
MMA,not_removed,fair enough im fine with people thinking dom won i just think it was a very close fight
MMA,not_removed,this is my opinion and your probably wont agree with what i say or maybe understand idk but i think dom won clearly on the scorecards even though an incredibly close fight
MMA,not_removed,fake account but still a little funny
MMA,not_removed,thank god that is a parody account
MMA,not_removed,we are living in a weird weird timeline i kinda like it
MMA,not_removed,damn dave how much shit you gonna post at once homie
MMA,not_removed,i thought the cartoon arm in the poster was his xd
MMA,not_removed,from the thumbnail he looks just like tracy mcgrady
MMA,not_removed,so the mmaaa couldve gone with some different letters but oh well
MMA,not_removed,i dont think bjorn is competent enough but thats just my judgement
MMA,not_removed,seems mad but i dont think three former world champions will outweigh rebneys reputation
MMA,not_removed,keep this fucker far away from that union pension fund
MMA,not_removed,maybe one of these will stick ariel is right though cant have potential unions fighting each other
MMA,not_removed,i cant take mmaaa seriously as a name
MMA,not_removed,loser leaves town match
MMA,not_removed,mma aa
MMA,not_removed,thats pretty much what half the world shouts when they need their mom to wipe their ass ah those years
MMA,not_removed,i think the guys who he has with him are too smart to not recognize incompetence
MMA,not_removed,dont tell donald cerrone that one or he will run the other way
MMA,not_removed,does he really care for fighters or is this hes last ditch attempt to stay relevant and get revenge at the big promotions
MMA,not_removed,what does he need revenge for he was running bellator at a huge loss on sports affiliate networks until viacom swooped in and overpaid majorly for it he should be happier than a pig in shit about his mma experience he is still shady as fuck but he doesnt need revenge against anyone
MMA,not_removed,revenge is childish imo i dont kow the guy anyways there is obviously to be made and you cant knock a guy for pursuing paper
MMA,not_removed,it is maybe along the heavyweight the only division right now where the champ is im gonna fight the best competitor or anyone really this hurt to read
MMA,not_removed,what about
MMA,not_removed,belongs in the daily thread
MMA,not_removed,nunes is being forced to fight the best in her division im sure she would rather fight the winner of the hollyother chick fight
MMA,not_removed,im not familiar with biespeing
MMA,not_removed,horrible troll thread horribly obvious
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,the difficulty of you finding tickets is directly related to how much money is currently in your bank account
MMA,not_removed,you wont have trouble getting a ticket if you have an unlimited budget if youre looking for tickets in one of the cheaper tiers or maybe even the tickets youll need a lot of luck
MMA,not_removed,i just checked you can sit in the zuffa red panties section for ea
MMA,not_removed,if you want some for less than i would guess you would have a very hard time based on the presales nothing is impossible to get tickets to anymorefor a price
MMA,not_removed,i would buy asap otherwise youll get stuck with expensive seats tickets probably wont sell out right away but the cheapest tickets will disappear and the nosebleed seats are already hundreds of dollars
MMA,not_removed,stop wasting your timei paid for nosebleeds and that was the minute after presales came outhard for me to imagine general sale would be cheaper than presales since demand is so high at this point you wont find any ticket for under and thats basically paying to say i went to greatest card in historybut i will end up watching it on the jumbotron because the ring is to far to see for me its all about the experience thus why i paid so much for shitty seatsat least thats what i have to tell myself
MMA,not_removed,ufc is basically sold out unless youre willing to drop a g on a single ticket the resellers are all fight club members and get access days before the public those tickets are currently being marked up if theres ever an opportunity to make money especially in new york chances are youre shit outta luck and the people who do this for a living as a means of income have already beaten you to it it sucks its the same for any sport here in ny except maybe hockey cause who watches that garbage
MMA,not_removed,is probably the biggest event in ufc history this card beyond stacked so getting tickets for this im guessing will get you nose bleeds ringside
MMA,not_removed,this is so true especially in nyc
MMA,not_removed,one day
MMA,not_removed,definitely worth the experience thats the only reason i wanna go theres no fighter that brings out the energy of a crowd like mcgregor does
MMA,not_removed,the ufc doesnt offer the bottom tiers at the presale the tickets will be released tomorrow for everyone
MMA,not_removed,lol wat its expensive as fuck but not even close to that bad
MMA,not_removed,the tickets i got are not that far away from the top so i am gonna guess those are in very limited numbers even some seats are in the upper deck
MMA,not_removed,wishful thinking but good luck
MMA,not_removed,where did you hear that
MMA,not_removed,seriously it will definitely be difficult to get tickets but for nosebleeds foh
MMA,not_removed,hes joking
MMA,not_removed,minimum for ringside why do you think they only have celebs in the front and other rich people msg is the pinnacle of arenas in the us msg is also the most prestigious there is a reason why muscians boast they sold out at msg or are playing at msg nosebleeds will be at least probably higher
MMA,not_removed,i actually asked this earlier but they removed my question what does get you for presale seat in the
MMA,not_removed,you can literally see prices online nosebleeds are currently going for plus and its going to be lower tomorrow ringside is a few thousand stop pulling numbers out of your ass
MMA,not_removed,yes there are seats that are in the
MMA,not_removed,lower tomorrow only they are shooting towards idiot stop talking about what you dont know
MMA,not_removed,prices you see online â  actual prices sorry bud hate to break that to ya i already have seen reports of the figures ive stated
MMA,not_removed,got a source on that
MMA,not_removed,you said so getting tickets for this im guessing will get you nose bleeds ringside you literally just said youre guessing
MMA,not_removed,so what about the people that have got them for
MMA,not_removed,i was using it as a figure of speech you fool
MMA,not_removed,youre full of it
MMA,not_removed,womens strawweight intercontinental championship this fight deserves to be five rounds but oh well
MMA,not_removed,love karolina kontender but predicting a for claudia with kk rallying to win the latter half of the third after gadelha starts to get tired
MMA,not_removed,i want karolina kowockaflockaflameiewicz to win this one just so her and jj can sling leather one mo time
MMA,not_removed,awesome i would have no problem with jjclaudia or jjkk if champ gets past andrade
MMA,not_removed,both are gs and bae ð who do i root for
MMA,not_removed,its a rounder and in brazil as well rip karolina
MMA,not_removed,heck yeah
MMA,not_removed,this is going to be a great fight
MMA,not_removed,battle of the qts
MMA,not_removed,would love a rematch between kk and joanna but i got gadelha in this
MMA,not_removed,winner should face rosewaterson winner
MMA,not_removed,i was really hoping this fight to be main event on some ufc on fox karolina is a slow starter unfortunately hope she gets it done
MMA,not_removed,womens strawweight has quietly become the most exciting division in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,yeaaahh i got karolina by decision shes a fucking terminator
MMA,not_removed,koalawitches is about to have a bad time
MMA,not_removed,seems like the ufc is pushing for jj vs claudia not exactly my top choice but oh well id much rather see jj fight the winner of rose and karate hottie assuming jj wins of course
MMA,not_removed,rounder goes to claudia
MMA,not_removed,rooting for karolina im not sure if i really want to see jj vs claudia
MMA,not_removed,claudia is so damn handsome
MMA,not_removed,of my favorite fighters at strawweight i dont know who to root for
MMA,not_removed,if i was dana i would make this an interim
MMA,not_removed,count down to claudia losing all chill on twitter
MMA,not_removed,love this fight both girls are awesome
MMA,not_removed,decisionbot jÄdrzejczyk vs gadelha
MMA,not_removed,gadelha is the undisputed round champ
MMA,not_removed,i think claudia wins this fight quite decisively especially if its only rounds she seemed to run out of gas vs jj in the championship rounds
MMA,not_removed,claudia
MMA,not_removed,wardelha
MMA,not_removed,curious to see if claudia ends up at jacksons again for this camp she seemed to like training with michelle waterson who has a fight coming up with rose a few weeks earlier both of them absolutely destroyed their admittedly outmatched opponents after training together also the high altitude training with a cardio queen like waterson has got to be good for claudias only glaring weakness her gastank
MMA,not_removed,hell yeah punch her up karolina
MMA,not_removed,claudia takes the first two rounds before gassing in the but it wont be enough
MMA,not_removed,would really love kk to win this big fan but id see it most likely being a close fight with claudia edging it
MMA,not_removed,this could be a really sick card hopefully they add nunes v shevchenko and maybe rdas welterweight debut
MMA,not_removed,claudia is a whole different beast in a three round fight rooting for kk though
MMA,not_removed,man this will be a good fight like both really reaaaally wanna see kk win but will be a tough one to pull out
MMA,not_removed,should be fun
MMA,not_removed,well rip kk
MMA,not_removed,sucks they made this a rounder
MMA,not_removed,gadelha will win on decision
MMA,not_removed,at first thinking i thought kk is just a pretty face about to get rekt by real competitors but after her perfomance in ufc i was in awe she looked liked a killer and almost knock jj down shes a real deal and im now looking forward to her fights
MMA,not_removed,good fight unless gadelhas improved her cardio i got karolina by ud
MMA,not_removed,so psyched go claudia
MMA,not_removed,claudia looks like a gorilla in this picture wouldnt want to mess with her
MMA,not_removed,surprised that alot of people wouldnt be excited for jj vs cg claudia got robbed in their first fight and the second one was also very close and entertaining
MMA,not_removed,in a round fight gadelha will take it kks tdd isnt good enough to stop the shot
MMA,not_removed,â¤ï¸karolinaâ¤ï¸
MMA,not_removed,due to the fact its a round fight id lean towards gadelha win however id rather see karolina win because gadelha losing to jj for a third time doesnt excite me too much
MMA,not_removed,karolina
MMA,not_removed,the fight for second place
MMA,not_removed,goldberg secretly sighs in relief that he doesnt have to announce this fight
MMA,not_removed,karolina is hawt
MMA,not_removed,im excited to watch the actual fight but im not sure if its good timing to have the and strawweights fight karolina kowalkiewicz just lost to joanna jÄdrzejczyk while claudia gadelha is only one fight removed from fighting joanna whoever wins between this fight has a very strong claim to be next in line for the title id have much preferred to have had either women face someone like tecia torres or joanne calderwood first before getting matched up against each other i just feel its too soon to have a rematch for either if joanna beats jessica andrade plus it also gives tecia or jojo a chance to get into the title picture
MMA,not_removed,first to thai clinch wins
MMA,not_removed,lets go claudia
MMA,not_removed,claudia is love claudia is life
MMA,not_removed,rounder is stupid in this case claudia will take her down firt rounds gas and win a dec
MMA,not_removed,if its five rounds i got karolinaclaudia can only fight for rounds
MMA,not_removed,gadhela will take her down and sub her
MMA,not_removed,the only fight that makes sense both need to show they deserve to fight joanna again
MMA,not_removed,all i see is erik silva vs cro cop
MMA,not_removed,i dont see carolina handling those take downs well
MMA,not_removed,i think gadelha is the only one who realistically stands a chance against jj
MMA,not_removed,karolina kutie
MMA,not_removed,how do you make that bad of a pic with both of those women who are so cute
MMA,not_removed,poor claudia will get her ass handed to her again and develop hatred towards polish people
MMA,not_removed,i dont usually care about wsw but ill be watching this
MMA,not_removed,girls fighting each other weighing the same size as the average grade boy not even a title fight why should i buy this ufc edit more downvotes but no reasons
MMA,not_removed,rounds so i think claudia takes this if it were rounds i think karolina could get the w after claudia gasses out
MMA,not_removed,i dont know if claudias hands could take rounds of punching karolina in the face we all seen the jj fight and no matter what jj hit her with she kept coming forward insane heart and completely relentless pressure
MMA,not_removed,rounds should be the norm in high level mma i wouldnt mind all top matchups being
MMA,not_removed,just wait for the interim title announcement event though jj is fighting a month before
MMA,not_removed,this fight deserves to be five rounds but oh well just give them an interim belt
MMA,not_removed,this fight deserves to be five rounds but oh well this is becoming an increasingly common problem i think the ufc needs to make all fights with at least one fighter ranked in the top automatically rounders every big ppv card i find myself unsatisfied that a fight that should be rounds is only romeroweidman dillashawlineker cejudobenavidez all come to my mind as recent fights that shouldve been rounds considering their relevance to the division
MMA,not_removed,think itll be main event i dont think so because they probably want rose as the next challenger
MMA,not_removed,just put an interim bullshit belt and there you go
MMA,not_removed,tbf this as main event would be kind of a tough sell when they have a combined ufc finishes between them
MMA,not_removed,yeah this is one of those three rounds favors gadelha but five rounds would favor kk fights imo
MMA,not_removed,kowockaflockaflameiewicz that is a comment
MMA,not_removed,you misssplellled kowalkewfadfsbadbfv
MMA,not_removed,kk is going to get taken down and crushed for rounds straight even jj would have lost to claudia in a round fight
MMA,not_removed,i read that in goldies voice without even meaning to do so
MMA,not_removed,i think rose vs michelle is the next title eliminator personally claudia and karolina are going to need big winning streaks to get back into contention
MMA,not_removed,not a fan of the idea of claudia getting another shot against jj after that kk as well tbh both should have one more before that imo
MMA,not_removed,if champ gets by andrade what kind of horse tranquilizer are you on jj is no rr andrade couldnt even knock out that hill girl and hill clocked her hard more than a couple times andrade ded this fight is so awesome a part of me wants to say something about how cute they both are so i just did get it on hotties
MMA,not_removed,root for both winwin situation
MMA,not_removed,root for a unanimous draw
MMA,not_removed,no camp injuries
MMA,not_removed,root both obviously
MMA,not_removed,do you honestly believe the ufc and usada lets a fighter get away with roiding just because he or shes brazilian and the fight is in brazil or are you just being a hater
MMA,not_removed,probably but ive seen you win some amazing upsets i love watching cause anything can happen
MMA,not_removed,thats a stretch
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt love it kk was successful for all of seconds in a minute fight
MMA,not_removed,more exciting than lw and ww even mw has a pretty stacked top thats really fun to watch fight each other
MMA,not_removed,wtf
MMA,not_removed,seems like the ufc is pushing for jj vs claudia i dont think thats really the case theyd have matched claudia up with a rising fighter by now if they were trying to line her up for another shot a win over someone who just lost to joanna isnt going to get her another title shot yet
MMA,not_removed,id much rather see jj fight the winner of rose and karate hottie granted the ufc are running out of strawweights to throw at jj but i dont think either rose or waterson have earned a title shot yet itd be a more interesting fight maybe since weve seen jj beat gadelha and kowalkiewicz recently but im not ready to give up on the idea of earning title shots yet imo winner of namajunas v waterson should face the winner of gadelha v kowalkiewicz for a title shot winner of the rising stars vs winner of the gatekeepers
MMA,not_removed,jj vs claudia was such a great fight tho
MMA,not_removed,would much rather see that than jj vs karolina
MMA,not_removed,an interim title fight would be hilarious considering the champion is scheduled to defend the title
MMA,not_removed,joanna jedrzejczyk defeats clÃ¡udia gadelha unanimous decision tuf finale team joanna vs team clÃ¡udia finale â july roundjedrzejczykgadelhajedrzejczykgadelhajedrzejczykgadelha judges in order dave hagen jeff mullen marcos rosales media member scores people scored it jedrzejczyk people scored it jedrzejczyk people scored it draw
MMA,not_removed,joanna beat claudia in rounds fight
MMA,not_removed,her official ufc pictures are so horrible
MMA,not_removed,how does that make it stupid if shes the better fighter under the rules shes the better fighter cant just randomly make fights rounds to help out cardio fighters
MMA,not_removed,eh i think kks gonna get submitted
MMA,not_removed,this is wsw not wbw
MMA,not_removed,claudia gasses out after the first minute
MMA,not_removed,karolina diaz
MMA,not_removed,what claudio stopped pressuring in the and round against joanna froze up and took a shitload of punches joanna won those two rounds despite pacing herself
MMA,not_removed,this claudia is the best round fighter at this fight would be way more interesting with rounds
MMA,not_removed,i totally agree all atleast pro mma fights should be rounds no other sport does the rule change depending on whether you in the super bowl or a bout im compiling a study right now on whether having champ fights as long has any effect
MMA,not_removed,they should make an interim belt because jj is busy fighter another fighter
MMA,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from but this would be a disaster all the halfdecent shows would take forever
MMA,not_removed,i disagree completely round fights allow us to get more fights in a card and encourage the fighters to go all out looking for a finish early on instead of pacing themselves
MMA,not_removed,maybe top
MMA,not_removed,this event already has aldoholloway so no
MMA,not_removed,pretty much the case in any claudia fight haha if all fights were rounds claudia would be the best strawweight in the world
MMA,not_removed,i dont think even rounds would favour karolina claudia wont find it as hard to get her down and keep her down as she did against joanna joanna contributed to claudia gassing in that fight i think claudia would take at least rounds in a round fight this is going to be a long night for karolina
MMA,not_removed,yeah she even tried some takedowns late in rounds where she didnt need them iirc
MMA,not_removed,i think jj would have lost because she planned for the round fight
MMA,not_removed,they had that once she won
MMA,not_removed,even jj would have lost to claudia in a round fight she already did imo
MMA,not_removed,claudia for sure but if karolina wins this one convincingly shed probably be win away from another shot
MMA,not_removed,claudia i agree would need a few more wins so shes effectively the only option since shes against joanna already but karolina could probably get a shot off of a couple of wins if karate hottie beats rose then she could get a title shot but if rose wins shes only on a fight win streak so i think shed need at least one more
MMA,not_removed,is this legal
MMA,not_removed,this is what im doing for rose vs michelle
MMA,not_removed,i could see that being possible in the scenario either claudia wins the first round dominantly then kk wins the next two or claudia wins the first two but gasses and gets lit up in the last round
MMA,not_removed,hes referring to brazilian judges allegedly being biased or corrupt and yet australian and canadian judges get away with murder every time just your usual run of the mill bigoted comment on reddit
MMA,not_removed,oh come on thats harsh id say juicing year old brazilian boy
MMA,not_removed,yeah people overstate the whole joanna getting rocked things she got caught once in a minute fight the rest of the fight was joanna pounding her face in
MMA,not_removed,this jj vs kk is just a boring style matchup kk is basically just a worse version of jj meaning she only really has a punchers chance and these are lb women
MMA,not_removed,but that wink
MMA,not_removed,even though joanna won i still feel like she never actually put karolina in danger karolina came out pretty clean compared to joannas other opponents
MMA,not_removed,i think so yeah but i by no means would say lw ww or mw are boring wsw top and even top all just have so much potential also jj has the second highest number of title defenses for current champ imo a dominant champ with a busy and stacked top makes for the most exciting divisional climate plus every one of jjs fights are exciting
MMA,not_removed,they were trying to make esparza
MMA,not_removed,true true idk different strokes i guess
MMA,not_removed,and gadelha got robbed in their first fight they should be
MMA,not_removed,and gadelha got robbed in their first fight they should be
MMA,not_removed,and gadelha got robbed in their first fight they should be
MMA,not_removed,and gadelha got robbed in their first fight they should be
MMA,not_removed,why jj vs karolina wasnt competitive at all apart from that one moment
MMA,not_removed,yet she won the first two rounds against joanna
MMA,not_removed,she gasses walking to the cage
MMA,not_removed,yo if she and diaz had a baby that kid would be downright indestructible
MMA,not_removed,ÅÃ³dÅº kurwa
MMA,not_removed,closer to the pillow hands side
MMA,not_removed,i dont think thats a thing at womens strawweight
MMA,not_removed,hes talking about kk
MMA,not_removed,that has nothing to do with his comment
MMA,not_removed,trim the lower end of the roster do less but higher quality fights youre saving money and offering a better product
MMA,not_removed,wow just realized this is in brazil karolina going into enemy territory i like claudia but hope kk can pull it off
MMA,not_removed,yeah its too bad you cant carry a massively muscular frame and have top tier stamina at the same time steroids cant help with everything
MMA,not_removed,ill be looking for improvement in that realm from her shes had a long time to train for cardio since last summer when that was obviously a major factor to her loss it seems to me cardio is an easy thing to work on much easier than most other aspects of a fight just put on some shoes and run for mins a day not saying she could equal jjs cardio in months but she could easily be way better than what we saw last goaround
MMA,not_removed,i like your post because its contrary to conventional wisdom on this thread its interesting looking at this fight from different angles
MMA,not_removed,its not really part of a plan to get rocked and taken down claudia is the best womans sw fighter in the world in the first round and a half
MMA,not_removed,claudia is going to need to go on a huge run to get another shot as long as jj is still champ look how long of a streak benavidez has and still hasnt booked a shot at dj
MMA,not_removed,rose needs a lot more than just victory in my opinion if you look at her record its following the pattern of good win loss to a worse opponent and this repeats she is if im not mistaken and that is in no position to challenge for the belt
MMA,not_removed,thats fucking illegal
MMA,not_removed,absolutely fucking not
MMA,not_removed,exactly hometown decisions exist anywhere in the world have yall seen fedors last fight
MMA,not_removed,he could just be talking about the fans being on cgs side a bit early to call him a bigot no
MMA,not_removed,you only need to be caught once
MMA,not_removed,i said this
MMA,not_removed,that chance nearly came through though
MMA,not_removed,yes but jj lacks the power to put great fighters away shes the female cruz
MMA,not_removed,im saying that i dont want to see jj vs karolina id rather see jj vs claudia
MMA,not_removed,its not a championship bout
MMA,not_removed,her best round in their first fight was the third
MMA,not_removed,add in the chins of mark hunt roy nelson cub and doo hoi choi just to be safe
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say that shes clearly a volume striker but she did drop claudia in their first fight with that uppercut
MMA,not_removed,i love how people just forget she finished esparza and penne
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah that makes more sense now i doubt claudio will want to strike with karolina though
MMA,not_removed,a hometown fight against one of if not the best three round female fighter is a tall order for anyone i like karolina but im not a fan of her odds
MMA,not_removed,fixing her punching mechanics would help a lot
MMA,not_removed,might be the more appropriate face
MMA,not_removed,its not really part of a plan to get rocked and taken down it was clearly part of the plan to weather an early storm and capitalise later on though she said as much after the fight anyone who had really paid attention in claudias previous fights new that her getting tired was a serious problem for her had it been rounds she would have started pushing the pace earlier than she did
MMA,not_removed,just because other athletic commissions and judges show favoritism doesnt mean there isnt an issue here or that he doesnt have a point
MMA,not_removed,my man
MMA,not_removed,and jj has been caught times in her last fights the andrade fight will be interesting
MMA,not_removed,well shell still have to catch her a whole lot harder then that much vaunted single punch didnt even drop jj
MMA,not_removed,i was agreeing with you
MMA,not_removed,meh jj came back after seconds to carry on dominating its hardly like she landed a h bomb
MMA,not_removed,jj kod penna and esparza her last two rounds against claudia were each i think kk was just pretty good about not taking much damage from jj so its not just about power itself
MMA,not_removed,what about footwork i havent rewatched her fights in a while im sure its good but i dont recall seeing footwork comparable to cruz dillashaw or cody
MMA,not_removed,oh my bad i went full dyslexic mode lol
MMA,not_removed,hahaha did that guy black out in that fourth round as karolina landed that punch and just assume she won and that karolina is now champ
MMA,not_removed,in their second fight she clearly won the first two which is what i was referring to
MMA,not_removed,thats a lot of chins
MMA,not_removed,and shes a natural who attributed the loss of hand power and durability to the class shes forced into
MMA,not_removed,jake shields definitely has pillow fists
MMA,not_removed,claudio
MMA,not_removed,claudia was outstriking joanna untill she gassed
MMA,not_removed,the face was coming from claudias point of view
MMA,not_removed,pushing the pace doesnt matter when claudias fresh she won the first fight imo as well and that was rounds
MMA,not_removed,aye shes got power in those hands i still think joanna takes it though
MMA,not_removed,oh aye just saying that if you outrule karolina because she didnt do too well against joanna then no one in that division should be fighting joanna kk claudia and joanna are sws cejudo benavidez and johnson
MMA,not_removed,she absolutely did not ko penne she stopped her on volume and gore not actually by dropping and knocking her out she did tko esparza but that was more the exception than the rule
MMA,not_removed,shes much more subtle she takes lots of small adjustment steps to get a dominant angle where cruzdilly are moving way more to not only fluster you with angles but distance joanna isnt interested in getting further away she keeps her preferred distance and works within that range with small pivots and small adjustments she trusts her defense enough to stay in range cruz wants to get in from way outside hit you and get back out of range before you can hit him back joanna wants to hit you make you miss while she stays in position then hit you again and again and again
MMA,not_removed,still not as many chins as ops mom
MMA,not_removed,what can i say im a chins man
MMA,not_removed,still nit as many as urijah faber
MMA,not_removed,cuz he puts everyone including the fans to sleep
MMA,not_removed,member jon fitch i member
MMA,not_removed,good eye sniper
MMA,not_removed,alls im saying is those traps dont lie
MMA,not_removed,thats not how i remember the fight
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,even if claudia should have won that first fight i think most would agree that joanna was more offensive in those rounds than she was in the first rounds of the second fight partly because it was a shorter fight im sure shes joanna also a noticeably better fighter now than she was in that first fight so i dont think itd be a given that claudia would win in rounds
MMA,not_removed,agreed
MMA,not_removed,i like andrades chances
MMA,not_removed,shots fired
MMA,not_removed,now you shoot and ill run
MMA,not_removed,my favorite shakira song
MMA,not_removed,im gunna let you finish but her and beyonce had one of the best songs of all time with beautiful liar
MMA,not_removed,does this mean im not gonna be able to get warmed up for bellator cards by watching meth addicts get arrested fml
MMA,not_removed,i hope they do more stuff like ufc countdown or embedded i really hate bellators versions of that stuff all they do is have jimmy smith interviewed about the fighters and stuff ufc does that with joe but its just a small youtube preview not the main countdown show
MMA,not_removed,spike tv is aids lets see if it can pull itself out of the shitty bowels of toilet tv i doubt it but i hope so
MMA,not_removed,hopefully the change the name i dont think bellator will ever really take off to they get a better name
MMA,not_removed,i hope it airs online too this sounds great
MMA,not_removed,its pretty clear that the weakness the ufc is going to have going forward is promotion they have fired so many people and apparently are going to hand off fight filming and production to their next tv partner some say fox will be much better and for the top fighters i agree mainly because the ufc only recently started putting together decent fighter back story promotions however fox isnt going to pump that many fighters however there are lots of interesting fights throughout most cards unbeaten guys returning from long layoffs even guys facing getting cutall interesting stories if some effort is put in to tell them to viewers not sure if bellator is going to really outclass the ufc in promotion but it sure is a weakness
MMA,not_removed,seems like an awkward mix of lowest common denominator spike leftovers lip synch battle bar rescue ink master etc mixed in with attempts at prestige television they are going to have to pick one to have any sort of identity i wonder what they will do with cops i cant imagine it ever ending production its been on since the
MMA,not_removed,in this context burn means to smoke the devils lettuce oh heavens me how ghastly
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck am i reading
MMA,not_removed,jeff glover is one of the coolest guys ive met from the bjj scene ive met him at the adcc in sao paulo right after he lost to geo martinez and even though he sounded a little disapointed he was still happy and actually quite funny
MMA,not_removed,man what you cropped yourself out of the picture i dont even know what to make of a gesture like that
MMA,not_removed,haha hit me up if you wanna burn
MMA,not_removed,tonon wants to come off as gracious in defeat but instead ends up being way too pompous
MMA,not_removed,i think that he should face tbd next
MMA,not_removed,op is the hero we need
MMA,not_removed,some of that sweet sticky icky
MMA,not_removed,op is actually super sage
MMA,not_removed,pretty siked to here tonon smokesi think everyone knew jeff glover was getting high but the dds burn sesh would be sickuntil they start reaping everything in sight
MMA,not_removed,garry tonon posted about how he lost to shoe face and in the comments jeff glover politely invites tonon to participate in smoking marijuana with him if he feels so inclined
MMA,not_removed,he seems like an awesome guy even tho he has the word americana tattooed on his stomach
MMA,not_removed,i met him after ebi right after he lost to geo martinez he was in the parking lot smoking i hope he competes in ebi again
MMA,not_removed,hes on some gladiator shit i guess
MMA,not_removed,hes still really young hell grow up more
MMA,not_removed,are you okay noo that guy was too funny edit it happens around the mark
MMA,not_removed,i wish i looked like that man
MMA,not_removed,jeff glover also lost just so thats clear as it wasnt to me when i looked at this thread title seems weird as to me implies that it would compare posts from each competitor talking about their respective losses but really its ones take on their own loss and the other guy asking him to smoke in the comments sorry if this seems pedantic but from the title and image alone i was confused as fuck as someone who doesnt follow bjj
MMA,not_removed,dont be hatin bro make americanas great again
MMA,not_removed,maybe hes just a big offspring fan haha
MMA,not_removed,the guy loves deep half and smoking the ganja my kind of dude
MMA,not_removed,nate josÃ© is dying back here man
MMA,not_removed,also not clear that youjitsu is jeff glovers handle but i like the post anyway
MMA,not_removed,i aint hatin just mirin jeffs choice of inkage thats all
MMA,not_removed,id believe it
MMA,not_removed,was i the only one that thought masvidal vs larkin was a great showing from both fighters it was easily my favorite of the night and i was really looking forward to what you had to say about it
MMA,not_removed,i was a bit confused when you seemed to imply garbrandt has a significant reach advantage on brimage brimage has freakishly long arms for his height and harbours a inch reach advantage on garbrandt despite being the shorter fighter
MMA,not_removed,are you just not going to ever have someone proofread your work i mean we are all pedantic neckbeards smashing away on keyboards because we have tiny cocks etc etc but jesus christ jack do you just not care every single article is almost embarrassingly full of mistakes your analyses are the best and the market moves slow you can wait a few hours to release your work and have someone proofread for fucks sake someone on reddit would do it if youd just ask
MMA,not_removed,have to disagree with you implying that the main event made up for a boring card baraostephens felderburkman and larkin masvidal were all awesome fights
MMA,not_removed,great article and fun read couple of grammatical errors if you want to fix it up
MMA,not_removed,great job as always jack but you fucked up the spacing on the title here
MMA,not_removed,very good breakdown i like how he pointed out how such limited weaponry can always get the job done in multiple ways i thought the night of fights was good though the only real snoozer was mcmanneye i thought everything else was great
MMA,not_removed,i agree that it looked good on both fighters that eyepoke leaves a sour taste in my mouth though it obviously affected the fight and to think no point was even taken
MMA,not_removed,jakes slipping but you cant say it or youll get downvoted embarrassing editing as always
MMA,not_removed,i hear ya its working right up to deadlines and its a pain in the arse features i write in advance tend to get the full attention they need its when the bosses are in a hurry to publish that i tend not to have time to proof and often end up winding the article up quicker than id like to which is also why larkin vs masvidal and story vs saff didnt make it in been working on tomorrows for about a week so it should be better p
MMA,not_removed,are you just not going to ever have someone proofread your work part of the internet business model drop any internal review before publishing
MMA,not_removed,why do you think so many people call him hack slack hes an awful writer
MMA,not_removed,im with you the only fight i found boring on the main card was camozzi vs miranda story vs saffadeine was decent and the rest were great
MMA,not_removed,really i thought there was a good few dull moments on this card
MMA,not_removed,jesus man calm down its awesome and free content
MMA,not_removed,does it not go through a sub first
MMA,not_removed,could you not at the very least publish it and then take minutes to proofread it again yourself and then update it that wouldnt make a difference as far as deadlines are concerned but youd get rid of the blatant mistakes
MMA,not_removed,oh yes so many
MMA,not_removed,storysaffeidine larkinsmasvidal codyalmeida baraostephens kochcampbell were some good fights good free card imo
MMA,not_removed,yea im clearly fired up and need to calm down lol
MMA,not_removed,first time seeing larkin love finding a new fighter with a huge body of existing work hes been hanging around the mid card for years just sort of entertainingly picking up decision wins and losses the tumenov fight was a really fun one if you get a chance to watch it he even threw some hug tornados if he can just put the wins together he has a built in story line for a title shot having already beaten robbie lawler back in strikeforce
MMA,not_removed,pathetic bitch ur taking this a bit too seriously
MMA,not_removed,write a better article p
MMA,not_removed,fight pass was great colliers finish over uda was awesome felderburkman had some insane toetotoe moments even camozzimiranda was a decent fight i think the only snoozer was mcmanneye
MMA,not_removed,to be fair to you jacks obvious lack of a copyeditor is frustratingborderline embarrassing but to say his writing is slipping is just untrue hes a fantastic writer
MMA,not_removed,damn those are nice man how much did you pay if you dont mind me asking
MMA,not_removed,did you open the doors to the arena youre the first one there enjoy the fights man
MMA,not_removed,nicebefore the walkouts you can get up to the rail and high five a fighter if you see the camera and know youre in the shot do the robot
MMA,not_removed,ive been standing at the doors waiting to walk in theyre open but no one is in yet congrats on being able to get in lol
MMA,not_removed,those look great never been to a ufc event but i think i would rather sit where you are than anywhere on the bottom level it seems like you get a better view from where you are sitting
MMA,not_removed,is that the front row riser seats if so them are like the best seats in the house youll pretty much be seeing all fighters as they come out dude they leave on the other side though im pretty sure
MMA,not_removed,thats were theyre going to walk out isnt it damn thats nice
MMA,not_removed,some of the best seats in the house soak it in and have a blast brother
MMA,not_removed,savannah ga here ugh
MMA,not_removed,this is why i have no desire to ever see a ufc event live how the hell do you see anything with it filled up
MMA,not_removed,did you bring binoculars
MMA,not_removed,not a red cent i know thiago splitter a basketball player for the atlanta hawks and he gave me these
MMA,not_removed,was way too excited haha that plus a lot of boredom in my house
MMA,not_removed,ill be working on interpretation for phillips arena on the entrance from cnn center
MMA,not_removed,i got in for free lol
MMA,not_removed,jon jones has arrived
MMA,not_removed,arenas and their annoying advertisements
MMA,not_removed,yes it is i just saw the first two fighters come out through here its sweet
MMA,not_removed,hey its me your brother
MMA,not_removed,damn thats awesome ive been a fan of thiago since the first game with the spurs
MMA,not_removed,dang nice man
MMA,not_removed,thats super cool how do you know him
MMA,not_removed,thats awesome you can run around and try to get pictures
MMA,not_removed,tight man fun seats best seats in the house imo
MMA,not_removed,bruh hes not ready for me ill tickle him into submission
MMA,not_removed,whatever im a black belt kbw under the great traypanda
MMA,not_removed,ill take one for the team lads
MMA,not_removed,hmmi didnt know hes half mexican
MMA,not_removed,i always liked to watch the dude fight but he seems like a garbage human being in real life
MMA,not_removed,this guy didnt seem this much of an asshole on the jre podcast jesus was i wrong
MMA,not_removed,and in case there was any doubt stephens is an idiot here he is now to remove it
MMA,not_removed,im a head hunting true fighter that reacts on killer instinct not the pussy martial artist begging refs to stop the fight what a dick head edit the disagree button lol
MMA,not_removed,this guy should have taken marketing and pr lessons before piping up lots this weekend
MMA,not_removed,jeremy stephens be like httpsyoutubevubwbptjrqk
MMA,not_removed,anyone know yves edwards phone number
MMA,not_removed,its nice when youve been wondering if someone is a true asshole and they just come out and confirm it for you straight from their mouths not only is he an asshole stephens is a moron as well as a macho neanderthal its nice to know that those of us who believe in sportsmanship and who dont want to see fighters take unnecessary brain damage are pussies i would bet that stephens was an asshole bully growing up based on this statement and bullies are the worst people on earth
MMA,not_removed,rcringe
MMA,not_removed,i used to like stephens but damn here lately he is making is difficult
MMA,not_removed,god i hope so carwin can put his lights out and can gorilla pound on his head until the ref steps in
MMA,not_removed,thats literally the mentality of every fighter people on rmma consider warriors or soul takers
MMA,not_removed,hes my kind of fighter
MMA,not_removed,maybe he did ive never seen as many articles about him
MMA,not_removed,those women were in the nip
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,notice me shane
MMA,not_removed,rmma is where nothing is acceptable unless its your favorite fighter doing it
MMA,not_removed,which is also weird i understand fighting as hard as you can but ive never been a fan of the pounding on the obviously unconscious watching hendo dive on bisping is still hard to watch
MMA,not_removed,there are so many high level fighters higher than stephens by the way who dont share that opinion that it demonstrates its clearly not a requirement stephens isnt wrong when he says he can fight till the intervention and if the ref isnt stopping it hes going to keep blasting you but hes definitely an asshole about it plenty of world beaters can drop a guy realize its over and not throw a lunging haymaker into a crumpled corpse like he did to marcus davis
MMA,not_removed,i can appreciate how dedicated to the troll shtick
MMA,not_removed,ive got no willy
MMA,not_removed,and as long as they win
MMA,not_removed,the thing that bothers me is that stephens seems to take pride in pounding on unconscious opponents i mean i get that it happens the adrenaline is flowing and you want to finish your opponent before heshe can recover and its the refs job to tell you when to stop but if you can tell someone is out not pounding on them some more doesnt make you a pussy martial artist it makes you a decent human being i was a fan of hendos until i found out that he knew bisping was out and still threw that last bomband i cant stand bisping
MMA,not_removed,it was fun to watch at the time but then you go back and realise dan has a history of doing it it becomes ultra douchy but people just accept it because hes a warrior bro
MMA,not_removed,doesnt mary have a lovely bottom
MMA,not_removed,that pussy martial artist part is what makes him an unlikable asshole
MMA,not_removed,watching both jeremy stephens and hendo do it multiple times seems like they are trying to beat the ref by getting one last punch in before they can step in definitely dbags
MMA,not_removed,oh right yeah ted
MMA,not_removed,aoki is my favorite grappler but he will never come to ufc
MMA,not_removed,as a fellow filipino when the fight goes to the ground eduard folayang will get choked out in terms of bjj he is a purple at best just because of the str and conditioning ive had teammates grappled with him and they said hes not that good in the ground his striking is not that stellar either he tends to throw lots of haymakers
MMA,not_removed,what happened with lowen tynanes did shinya just not want to fight him aoki has been with one for over four years now and they are still doing fights like this with him
MMA,not_removed,eduard better tap dont want to see his
MMA,not_removed,eduard gets one of his limbs ripped off or goes to sleep on november
MMA,not_removed,edward furlong
MMA,not_removed,this the little shithead who likes to break peoples arms right
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt need to come to the ufc to get better fights than he is now he fights in one of the deepest weight classes in the world but one just gives him these terrible fights they have never given him anything interesting i remember the end of dream everyone was complaining about the opponents he was starting to get and those were all better than what he gets now they could find someone better than a guy with no grappling or power thats like the least interesting type of fighter for someone like aoki to fight
MMA,not_removed,like a lot of guys floating around the world why fight harder for less money only the very very top end of ufc gets ppv
MMA,not_removed,ufc is scared because hed tap
MMA,not_removed,thats why he signed with them before he went to one and since hes turned down offers from the ufc if he can get paid more to beat lower level comp more credit to him
MMA,not_removed,shinya aoki is a shithead but that arm break was justified hirota refused to tap and shinya just did what he was supposed to i think a much bigger example of his asshattery was his exhibition against nagashima the rules of the fight were that they have one round kickboxing one round grappling and one round of mma well aoki spent the first kickboxing round flopping and going for illegal takedowns because he knew that there were no judges for the fight so the ref couldnt deduct points for all his illegal moves then he got ktfo four seconds into the kickboxing round so i guess he got his just desserts
MMA,not_removed,crazy right i even heard he punches people in the face in a fight what a scumbag
MMA,not_removed,thats frank mir nbsp see sometimes a motherfucker is stupid and they wont tap when they should you are trying to win what are you going to do let him up hold him there until the match ends and lose a decision
MMA,not_removed,yeah what is this cage fighting
MMA,not_removed,aoki doesnt care about that and apparently neither does one hes got name recognition and a paycheck
MMA,not_removed,maybe michael page should do same thingbut of course everyone will say hes scared to be in ufc
MMA,not_removed,if there are a lot of guys floating around the world like that aoki should fight one of them
MMA,not_removed,i didnt mention the ufc they have better guys in one and outside the ufc than he is fighting
MMA,not_removed,no no no the first round was kickboxing and the second round was mma the fact that aoki got ktfo just seconds into his fighting round made the whole thing even more karmarific nagashima is also a cross dresser
MMA,not_removed,thats ronda rousey
MMA,not_removed,true but mir didnt flip off nog or sylvia and run around like a child pretending to be an airplane
MMA,not_removed,aoki is fine with crushing cans like he has his whole career
MMA,not_removed,the point stands he actively chose what type of comp he wants to face
MMA,not_removed,hes about to go eleven months in between fights maybe not
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,all that money and he chooses microsoft paint
MMA,not_removed,well slap my ass and paint me a potato
MMA,not_removed,how about using mcgregor way to disrespect the guy and treat him like a kid
MMA,not_removed,if connor gets s boxing license the ufc cant do anything about this fight because of the ali act i think this fight has a better chance of happening than most people think
MMA,not_removed,remove this shit please
MMA,not_removed,no masssss
MMA,not_removed,never been kissed this shit no she not bad but i dont understand how nobody kissed her might just be one of my favorite mma quotes right now
MMA,not_removed,too many movies makes heart weak
MMA,not_removed,laughed for like two minutes straight okay im on the khabib train
MMA,not_removed,this video is fucking hilarious cant believe khabib actually answered like that
MMA,not_removed,khabib really does have a great sense of timing for trash talkfunny talk a timing that transcends his language barrier
MMA,not_removed,it was almost funny
MMA,not_removed,i dont give a shit about this movie
MMA,not_removed,dude its simple marketing the main event for fell through rumble declined to fight mousasi for the interim title so they needed a title fight for holloway vs pettis was already on the card simple decision stupid but simple explanation not really a mind bender
MMA,not_removed,fun fact this is the second ufc featherweight interim title of the year
MMA,not_removed,there is literally no reason why this is for the interim fw belt interim belts were originally intended for when a champion is set to defend his belt but gets injured lastminute so the challenger faces a different contender for a fake belt just so he doesnt feel bad but now the interim belt is more like a marketing tool its fake its simply meant to make a fight seem like a title fight when it isnt
MMA,not_removed,its the ufc going with the goodfellas model of fuck you pay me in regards to its fanbase the ufc has really become a magnet for dumbfounding clusterfucks lately
MMA,not_removed,xposted from another topic theres an actual reason for this when the ufc signs the contracts with a venue for a big event part of the contract says that there will be a title shot on the card this is why the ufc scrambled and had tj dillashaw fight joe soto for a belt and why the ufc completely scrapped when jon jones wouldnt fight chael sonnen on late notice theyre obliged to have a title shot on these mega cards its still kind of stupid but they sort of forced their own hand by letting person hold up two divisions
MMA,not_removed,do you even know what interim belt is it aint shit
MMA,not_removed,yeah its basically a fight to see who gets to fight aldo
MMA,not_removed,at least pettis has a chance to join the history books
MMA,not_removed,interim belts are used for marketing purposes to sell more ppvs and because we dont know for sure how aldo will react to being champ after all he had to say recently
MMA,not_removed,you will find variations of what youve posted here as comments on literally every single thread about the fight since the announcement was made
MMA,not_removed,youre fight aldo shouldnt have a fake belt either mcregor should cut down and defend his belt
MMA,not_removed,its also a ploy to force aldo to fight again in the fw division aldo can easily say hes moving up to to get a fight with conor if there is an interim title he has to stick around
MMA,not_removed,oprah is one of the celebrity investors everybody gets a belt
MMA,not_removed,because the goofs at the ufc dont have confidence in pettis and holloway selling many ppvs and think if the put a title on the line itll sell more
MMA,not_removed,well at least you realize youre being unreasonable
MMA,not_removed,pettis is in his last and he might be an interim champion let that settle in
MMA,not_removed,do you not understand how interim belts work jose won the beltand forfeited itit doesnt just disappear lolit has to be unified with the championship belt
MMA,not_removed,exactly this is a desperate move by the ownership to not have to change this card into a free card on fox either that or fox just doesnt have the space available for the fight so they dont have a choice either way its the ufc having a belt on the line so that they can try and convince people to buy the ppv andor not demand a refund for their tickets
MMA,not_removed,third in months
MMA,not_removed,fun fact after hollowaypettis there will have been more interim featherweight champions than undisputed ones
MMA,not_removed,so in instead of just winning a title eliminator fight you get a shiny gold belt to go along with your title shot looks just like the real thing nifty
MMA,not_removed,winning this fight in my opinion does not put him in the same territory as bj penn couture and mcgregor i would argue it doesnt even put him in the same league as dan henderson
MMA,not_removed,jose didnt forfeit it and he is now the noninterim champion again without having to unify anything
MMA,not_removed,sell it on ebay make more than you would from reebok
MMA,not_removed,i saw something by phil mackenzie on twitter that was satirically proposing belt levels based on defenses like you get a silver belt for being the contender all the way up to a platinum belt for title defenses or i assume being mike perry
MMA,not_removed,big nog won an interim title why is he considered a former ufc champ
MMA,not_removed,the situation was completely different but i wouldnt consider him a ufc champ he was an interim champ
MMA,not_removed,ufc considers him a former champ
MMA,not_removed,ok as i said this is my opinion the fact is he never won the actual ufc title he was an interim champ same way condit isnt a ufc champ its not their fault its just the situation they were in
MMA,not_removed,in they kept beating each others ppv buy rate c r r c then conor kept climbing while ronda took a break
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say its disingenuous to call her the biggest star it all depends on how she returns
MMA,not_removed,shes a bigger star because more people that dont watch ufc know who she is
MMA,not_removed,conor is like a laser beam on the target demographic ronda is someone who gets people who had no idea people fight in cages for a living interested in following her
MMA,not_removed,who the fuck cares this dick measuring contest is always the same thing over and over not a dig at ur post op just in general theyre both huge stars
MMA,not_removed,dana says this where do you have a quote a link or are you just making shit up thats a rhetorical question by the way
MMA,not_removed,dana says ronda rousey is the biggest star because she is the biggest star all mma fans know her casuals know her through those famous short fight gifs and vids and various mainstream appearances on ellen and magazines not to mention she draws the soccer moms crowd
MMA,not_removed,he wants it to be more feminine but he also tried to stop mickey gall from walking out to hey mickey i am getting mixed messaged from dana white
MMA,not_removed,dont
MMA,not_removed,in north america in europe conor is much bigger
MMA,not_removed,i guess thats true but if conor is bringing in more people who are willing to pay bucks for a ppv but less overall people know him then that makes him more valuable tho
MMA,not_removed,ariel made a really observant comment during mma beat rondas return tweet only had likes and retweets whereas conors tweet that he gets fined more than the bums get paid had like ronda is bigger bc conor has limited himself to only mma hes not doing movies and tv shows wait until he does
MMA,not_removed,i agree several of my friends from spain a country where mma is basically non existent know who conor is even though they have never watched a ufc fight
MMA,not_removed,but ronda is doing that plus mainstream shit
MMA,not_removed,awesome
MMA,not_removed,not that i care at this point but tony calling khabib a bully is for sure a bit hypocritical war el cucuy
MMA,not_removed,khabibs fans are like something out of that adam sandler movie you dont mess with the zohan still made me smile to see them that riled up
MMA,not_removed,so it seems like wonderboy is hoping to gas out woolley based on what his dad said
MMA,not_removed,woodley is such a cool guy
MMA,not_removed,in case this video is removed or lost i have mirrored it i am a bot created by uineverquitewas please contact him if you have any questions or would like a bot of your own
MMA,not_removed,tyron jr just double legged that kid so explosively i almost busted into my jr voice bah god king hes broken in half
MMA,not_removed,el knockdown
MMA,not_removed,i dont see why this is a big deal i would granted i love going to the movies by myself regularly so maybe im just weird
MMA,not_removed,i have its still fun unfortunately i had the loudest douchebag ive ever seen right behind me he would seriously just keep screaming throughout the whole event even when the arena was mostly quiet it was insane and i dont know how he didnt lose his voice
MMA,not_removed,i went to ufc alone made friends with a guy from australia to my left and the girlfriend of the former boxer sitting to my right at ufc hamburg i ended up sitting ampngst half of dagestan we all cheered on rustam khabilov and talked about khabibs greatness together real fans make nice with each other youll be allright mate
MMA,not_removed,i was working in atl and went to the ppv woodley won the belt solo it was not too bad i got a beer had a good seat and got to pay attention to the fights some kids came down and sat next to me trying to get closer to the action they were cool and would bring up a convo about the fights that night although it would of been fun to experience the event with a friend it was not bad at all going solo i would do it again
MMA,not_removed,i had plans to go to ufc tampa with one of my friends but he couldnt get the days off and i had bought my ticket already the card was stacked for a fight night card even with the injuries i drove from miami all the way to tampa alone which is about hours driving time and it was a great experience its kinda of like going to a movie theater alone definitely give it a shot if youre a hardcore mma fan editi remember sitting near darrel horchers family when he fought khalabib it was rough seeing their reaction to horcher getting smeshed
MMA,not_removed,ive never been to an event solo but i have been around other people who were i know usually when i go to eventsand ive been to a lotpeople tend to conversation with whoever is surrounding them especially if you know what youre talking about and can add to conversationgood luck
MMA,not_removed,going alone is the way to go i enjoy it because i can talk to the people around me make new connections and meet fighters
MMA,not_removed,great thing about going alone is once fights gets going people tend to bond with strangers giving out high fives and such after watching a great fight i use to go alone to sport bars to watch ufc fights and met plenty of people there led to some great conversations in between fights
MMA,not_removed,went to chael vs tito alone two weeks ago spent most of the downtime between fights walking around taking pics with fighters got some great pics with nate diaz dom cruz machida werdum sage rampage etc if i were with my friend i probably wouldnt have left my seat
MMA,not_removed,you wanna go with me bae
MMA,not_removed,i have been to many ufcs by myself they are fun i find i come out of my shell more talk to strangers seated around me and usually move down closer to the cage for the later fights on the card
MMA,not_removed,i went to rockhold vs bisping alone in sydney around years ago i went straight to my seat and immediately started speaking to the guy next to me and for the entire hours of the card we were talking back and forth about what was happening during the fights kickboxing bjj and all sorts of things in mma you could be lucky enough to get to sit next to someone like that or you could get to sit next to the just bleed casual mma fan
MMA,not_removed,i went to ufc dublin in on my own perk of going alone is you can get a better seat i managed to get front row out of it look how close i was to the goat would recommend
MMA,not_removed,going to the movies solo is the shit the taboo around it is weird
MMA,not_removed,he probably did the next day i yelled my ass off at a chiefs game couldnt talk for a week
MMA,not_removed,let me guess he was wearing a tapout shirt
MMA,not_removed,i was in a situation like you for ufc belfast recently only thing is i had a loud prick infront of me who kept standing up and shouting some random ass name because he was drunk as fuck felt like pushing him down the stairs
MMA,not_removed,went to the cinema on my own for the first time in december to see rogue one and have now been times since then its great one of my biggest pet peeves is people talking to me during films so going on my own is great
MMA,not_removed,my man
MMA,not_removed,thats the only way to leave a chiefs game
MMA,not_removed,i honestly dont think so it seemed like it was just his thing and he screamed constantly wherever he went it was superhuman
MMA,not_removed,no he was actually wearing a polo shirt and chinos his son was with him though and while he wasnt wearing tapout afaik he was dressed in that style of clothing his son was actually perfectly civil though it was just his dad screaming
MMA,not_removed,respect he didnt back down for a second no matter what happened
MMA,not_removed,people could take lessons from this dude
MMA,not_removed,man i was a fan of cruz before and rooted for him but goddamn im a big fan of both of these guys now ive never seen someone take a loss this well
MMA,not_removed,to be honest i dont like cruz much but god fucking damn they set him up to give excuses with the question about how he didnt look as good as normal and maybe he was injured and he said no i was i was there and cody was the better man tonight so classy im a fan now
MMA,not_removed,cruz is a classy guy great class and dignity a great champion
MMA,not_removed,feels like this is from a movie responded and reacted to all the questions like how he responds to kicks and punches had an answer for all of them makes you wonder if he felt like he was gonna lose mid fight and planned this speech prior
MMA,not_removed,fuck cruz is amazing
MMA,not_removed,watching cruz lose the way he did made sick but i love how he is handling it still a hall of famer and one of the bests and i cant wait to see him fight again
MMA,not_removed,only if ronda adopted the same approach
MMA,not_removed,that is how you take a loss no excuses just owning up to everything with dignity i respected the guy before and now i respect him even more cody was also very classy in giving cruz the props he deserves and dedicating his win to maddox he made me a fan tonight with how he was both in and out of the octagon
MMA,not_removed,cruz is one classy motherfucker
MMA,not_removed,a don
MMA,not_removed,i had a lot of respect for cruz as a fighter before this but i didnt respect his personality or him as a person that all changed with this interview truly impressive mindset for someone coming off a loss like that
MMA,not_removed,known hes been like this for awhile understanding his mindset made me a fan of his shit talking conor is funnier but cruz is better and sharper
MMA,not_removed,love his attitude
MMA,not_removed,man i have so much respect for this guy i wonder what philosophy he reads because some of the things he says im attached to everything at once but not attached to anything and his stoicism makes me wonder
MMA,not_removed,damn that last line
MMA,not_removed,strongest mentality
MMA,not_removed,on nesn of all networks
MMA,not_removed,i definitely want to see cruz get back to a title shot half of this year or next year inspirational words he spoke here hope he stays quick and is able to plant his feet for some hard jabs next time around
MMA,not_removed,why would i sit im always on my feet
MMA,not_removed,take notes ronda
MMA,not_removed,was looking for this thanks mate
MMA,not_removed,i use to hate him but his talent won me over honestly he looked old and slow i think we saw a passing of the torch tonight it would be classy if dom just retired and went out as a great
MMA,not_removed,this is probably going to get downvoted but i really dont think cruz is taking this loss as well as every seems to think
MMA,not_removed,always on his feet like a g
MMA,not_removed,as always hes the realest
MMA,not_removed,especially the way it ended why would i sit down im always on my feet sounds like its from a script
MMA,not_removed,im just picturing dominick in rd or realizing this and going on to prepare a speech in his mind while going on autopilot against cody and that is actually hilarious
MMA,not_removed,new years resolution get a mindset like cruz
MMA,not_removed,except when he got dropped like times
MMA,not_removed,oh captain my captain
MMA,not_removed,what a dumb question to being with though why are you not sitting down
MMA,not_removed,confirmed this shit is rigged cruz knew he was gonna lose all along s
MMA,not_removed,i think he got clowned pretty bad by cody more than doms giving him credit for
MMA,not_removed,cant listen at the moment whats the fact
MMA,not_removed,apart from the fact that its pretty awesome that theyre all together in training camp which is very rare this might be a pretty nifty morale boost thing right also of course having this many highly talented people training together is always good
MMA,not_removed,i think that frankie weidman eddie wonderboy and chookagian all have mark henry as their striking coach
MMA,not_removed,the east coast super friends
MMA,not_removed,were working on a bug fix
MMA,not_removed,watching diaz slap mcgregor in the face beat him down and choke him out never gets old
MMA,not_removed,probably how this shit happened in the first place
MMA,not_removed,hope she can stay healthy this time excited to see her fight
MMA,not_removed,she has the most appropriate nickname in mma
MMA,not_removed,aug at utc quick side to side combo to work on while i cant actually punch things working on getting of line give it a try post it and tag me so i can see sharingiscaring httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,i cant quite make out who that is creepin on her from the wallrashad
MMA,not_removed,she thick
MMA,not_removed,easily one of the finest asians ive ever seen
MMA,not_removed,shadow boxing i hope she isnt that delicate that said i never want her to spar again unless she is wearing huge pillows on her hands
MMA,not_removed,lmao the end
MMA,not_removed,i was sitting there reading what i thought was a jon jones quote wondering how hed bring the truck analogy back to fighting and it never happened lol
MMA,not_removed,truck drivers
MMA,not_removed,as soon as i saw the end text i thought it was going to be a quote and was very confused for a second haha great video though nonetheless
MMA,not_removed,no idea lol i was like what
MMA,not_removed,why has everybody who has tried replicating the walk recently been so bad at it its really not that difficult
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,why is this here
MMA,not_removed,context doesnt hurt anyone
MMA,not_removed,i still dont get it why is this here i dont care that is i dont understand it
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,did he invent how to walk like that or something
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,ya ninja edited your comment to a simple question people attribute the strut to vince mcmahon but its popular to see in theatre in general a strut is a strut conor popularized it pro athletes are doing it a lot this year because of conor
MMA,not_removed,conor recently made it popular but it originally comes from vince mcmahon
MMA,not_removed,o the walk shoulda just said that conor did it so much better i didnt recognize pat even doing the same thing
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i have to fight for the title you know this i deserve it proceeds to wail on johnsons head
MMA,not_removed,that look when michael back fists him only thing that comes to mind is fine have it your way
MMA,not_removed,khabib is such a gangster its hilarious
MMA,not_removed,its refreshing to have a top guy that doesnt talk about money fights he just wants the belt same thing with maia at ww
MMA,not_removed,khabib by stone cold stunner
MMA,not_removed,fuck me dead if thats not the most gangster shit ever
MMA,not_removed,you have to give up
MMA,not_removed,goddamn i love khabib
MMA,not_removed,i love the little nod khabib gives johnson after he hit him with the backfist johnson refuses to give in and khabib respects that then khabib just starts wailing on him
MMA,not_removed,that noise when khabib hits johnson after telling him to give up
MMA,not_removed,i want to fight your chicken
MMA,not_removed,yes of course
MMA,not_removed,when khabib is twisting his arm it totally looks like his tattoos are veins that are about to pop
MMA,not_removed,i think tony will win and im rooting for him but holy fuck the build up for mcgregor vs khabib would be unbelievable
MMA,not_removed,is it gonna be or rounds fight
MMA,not_removed,ferguson might be khabibs worst stylistic matchup at lw but khabib is conors worst matchup tony is not on the other hand conor will benefit if tony wins this imo
MMA,not_removed,careful what you wish for khabib rushing in like you do on danas boy usually only ends one way better hope you have that diaz chin
MMA,not_removed,i hope tony beats him so bad yes baller af talking to dana and johnson during the fight but fuck this guy edit i wont delete it because i think thats lame but i would like to say that i regret posting this need to reassess shit
MMA,not_removed,i swear ive seen this video posted everyday for the last week the boogeymans coming for that russians neck newjohnwickbitch
MMA,not_removed,kebab has reached the end of his run
MMA,not_removed,that was menacingly gangster af
MMA,not_removed,they dont subtitle it but you can hear khabib say you agree at the end
MMA,not_removed,reminds me of that crazy euro guy from ed edd and eddy
MMA,not_removed,i understand wrong choice
MMA,not_removed,hes got more outside income than the ufc could ever pay him
MMA,not_removed,maybe i cant see the forest for the trees but i think khabib is going to fucking maul ferguson either way i am so fucking excited for this fight
MMA,not_removed,best trash talk ever
MMA,not_removed,i couldnt disagree with this more khabib is a mauler and an incredible grappler but his stand up is a real weakness against a guy who makes his living on exposing the weakness in their opponents striking tony on the other hand is a tall lanky fighter diazesque in his frame if you will joe but with the addition of better wrestling and way better foot movement than nates plodding and a more diverse attack than nates predictable hands i think conor would rather face khabib because he knows hes better at certain things ferguson is too well rounded with durability and cardio to boot fun fights either way tho
MMA,not_removed,why fuck this guy
MMA,not_removed,do you think one of the strongest people on the ground ever that showed weaknesses in that regard ever will be that easy to submit i am way less certain about an outcome here but would give khabib a light favourite role
MMA,not_removed,khabib has knockout power and ferguson has below average defense dont be surprised if el cucuy gets slept
MMA,not_removed,fuck you
MMA,not_removed,source
MMA,not_removed,thats not enough substance to say hes got more income outside the ufc maybe they are giving him all these gifts because hes succeeding in the ufc and when that stops will he keep receiving those gifts i guess he could work for that chechen warlord but i doubt he agrees with the warlords policies views actions etc he doesnt denounce them publicly because of safety concerns imo
MMA,not_removed,if he fights conor for real belt he will make life changing money even for khabib a pay day is no small deal for nearly anyone
MMA,not_removed,interesting take i guess tony is a dangerous matchup for connor too but khabib is probably much more likely to be able to drag connor to the ground than tony i cant say tonys chin is suspect but if connor had him wobbled like lando did hed have finished it right there most likely
MMA,not_removed,i want khabib to win but i would extremely surprised if khabib knocks him out ferguson might have bad defense but ferguson has much better offensive striking and a good jab i expect khabib to win but ferguson showed a good chin against barboza and rda and recovered well against lando so i would be surprised if khabib even hurts ferguson im not doubting khabibs power but i dont think he lands a good shot that hurts ferguson
MMA,not_removed,dagastani billionairs love him and give him cars and shit all the time
MMA,not_removed,russia
MMA,not_removed,very well connected to elites of the republic of dagestan who enjoy the exposition that khabib brings to the region and to other dagestan fighters shower him with money
MMA,not_removed,right but the thing is khabib has to drag him down to win tony doesnt
MMA,not_removed,weird source you cited there
MMA,not_removed,thats not enough substance to say hes got more income outside the ufc maybe they are giving him all these gifts because hes succeeding in the ufc and when that stops will he keep receiving those gifts i guess he could work for that chechen warlord but i doubt he agrees with the warlords policies views actions etc he doesnt denounce them publicly because of safety concerns imo
MMA,not_removed,chechnya and dagestan arent exactly friends either
MMA,not_removed,youre from estonia i should take your word for it
MMA,not_removed,thats a long moment
MMA,not_removed,how in the world did you think justin bieber was a good fit for this
MMA,not_removed,holloway can take a punch didnt get wobbled in the whole contest and countered with shots of his own
MMA,not_removed,td from mcgregor but lol to the background music
MMA,not_removed,the musical accompaniment is odd
MMA,not_removed,came for the moment stayed for thebieber
MMA,not_removed,people dont give enough credit to holloway for eating all those punches conor landed on him
MMA,not_removed,damn he slipped a lot of punches during exchanges i gotta rewatch this fight
MMA,not_removed,not a fan of the music choice personally i would of gone with baby
MMA,not_removed,those freeze frame things are fucking terrible i dont want to watch a video that makes me think my internet sucks
MMA,not_removed,lol justin bieber who thought that was a good choice yikes
MMA,not_removed,what is up with the music tho
MMA,not_removed,the music is almost as good as the one with the aspiring rapper that was suicidal
MMA,not_removed,max has a great chin
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah that one moment
MMA,not_removed,oh man i almost forgot about this fight holloway is a great fighter hardly gets hit and conor beat him up
MMA,not_removed,conor with the counter in between combos
MMA,not_removed,horrible song choice
MMA,not_removed,holy fuck what is that horrible music and why just why
MMA,not_removed,i miss dynamic conorleft hand conor is nice but
MMA,not_removed,biebers made some good music lately to be fair
MMA,not_removed,how old was max in this fight
MMA,not_removed,el cucuy
MMA,not_removed,max can reaaaaally take a punch
MMA,not_removed,max holloway actually did pretty well against conor max is pretty good at controlling the lead hand like conor and ended up using some of the same craft against him
MMA,not_removed,rightassuming he forgot the s in moment
MMA,not_removed,justin bieber is at mayweather fights mayweather vs conor confirmed get ops sources
MMA,not_removed,better than let the bodies hit the floor
MMA,not_removed,i actually like it
MMA,not_removed,holloway is a warrior just like andy wang
MMA,not_removed,didnt get wobbled but he looked shell shocked he couldnt commit to his combos
MMA,not_removed,dont hate on the bieb
MMA,not_removed,people dont give conor enough credit for landing all those lunches on him the win gets totally passed over and is looking more and more impressive as holloways rise continues those uppercuts are just so slick
MMA,not_removed,fuck outta here is ground breaking as fuck and revolutionised music as we know it
MMA,not_removed,freeze frame things what are you talking about your internet just sucks
MMA,not_removed,yeah wtf lol
MMA,not_removed,el bieber
MMA,not_removed,that match would be insane any match in the khabibconortony triangle would be spectacular
MMA,not_removed,what fight did you watch it cant be the one where max had literally nothing against conor for three rounds even when his knee was gone it cant be that fight
MMA,not_removed,cant find the original thread think it got deleted by op it was hilarious
MMA,not_removed,or hey now youre an allstar
MMA,not_removed,httpimgurcommfohbrg are everywhere lol
MMA,not_removed,dont mind the song just a very strange music choice for a fight
MMA,not_removed,yeah he definitely wasnt winning those exchanges but he stayed on his feet and fought back
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,didnt realise it was bieber so i didnt realise it was supposed to be ironic lol nice job as far as highlighting the successful moments he had in the fight though
MMA,not_removed,holloway does enjoy a good lunch
MMA,not_removed,imo this win is conors best if you want to look at a full display of his skill set he showed that he could keep someone guessing for the full length of a round fight and dominate with many different types of strikes and combos and even that he could grapple as well not even the biggest fan of mcg but this fight really impressed me would love to see these two face each other again down the road
MMA,not_removed,lets not pretend like max wasnt green as fuck at the time and isnt a totally different fighter now conor gets enough credit for this win he beat a young undeveloped prospect and he shouldnt get any more credit than that
MMA,not_removed,what do you mean
MMA,not_removed,nah hes right it does freeze a couple times in the video
MMA,not_removed,i watched the one that showed more than just a one sided fight he didnt exactly do literally nothing against conor there are lessons that fighters can take away from about dealing with some of conors craft like holloways lateral counters to deal with conors linear kicks those are very solid counters that are taught in muay thai of course max didnt win but he does deserve some credit for showing some solid moments of dealing with conors approach he did do better than many other opponents
MMA,not_removed,i want this played at my funeral when i turn
MMA,not_removed,this was my favorite rmma post ever my ears tapped within a minute of listening to your shitty mix tape im sad it is gone
MMA,not_removed,what in the fuck
MMA,not_removed,fuck you bro
MMA,not_removed,hahah wow
MMA,not_removed,looked like a matter of time to me if conor hadnt started shooting for takedowns presumably when his knee went he probably finishes him in the third
MMA,not_removed,dont think it was meant to be ironic a lot of people just love justin bieber right now not just teenage girls
MMA,not_removed,every day apparently
MMA,not_removed,tyron woodleys advice going horribly wrong
MMA,not_removed,yea this was enjoyable to watchon mute
MMA,not_removed,his variety of striking in this is crazy reminds me of his fight against buchinger pity about the injury in the second round
MMA,not_removed,add to that i believe connors knee blew out during the fight still dominated
MMA,not_removed,he shows off an amazing striking arsenal against ivan buchinger as well
MMA,not_removed,max had already fought leonard garcia dustin poirer and dennis bermudez among others in his fights in the ufc it was conors fight in the ufc i was concerned that it was too early for him to fight max to tell you the truth
MMA,not_removed,im kidding lol
MMA,not_removed,he successfully survived
MMA,not_removed,hopefully they shoot me in the cock so i will not reproduce my fucking human blood
MMA,not_removed,it was criminal how little attention it got i think it was because it just looked like some mcgregor nutthugger submission so barely anyone clicked
MMA,not_removed,goddamn point taken
MMA,not_removed,he actually hurt his knee on a pass after a takedown but i think the takedown was because he tried to do that weird kyokushin rolling thunder and botched it so he turned it into a takedown attempt which actually looked quite graceful
MMA,not_removed,i thought it was already torn up going into the fight i could be wrong its been a while
MMA,not_removed,he lost two of them fights
MMA,not_removed,whats insane is how good holloway has gotten with nobody special around him hes just working out with his buddies in hawaii bj penn style he has no exceptional training partners or coaches hes one step removed from coleman and randleman beating each other up in high school wrestling rooms and hitting a heavy bag in colemans back yard max has gotten to the top of a stacked division in mostly by himself the only other guys there you may know is smolka and medeiros
MMA,not_removed,so was i thats one of his songs
MMA,not_removed,now youre an allstar
MMA,not_removed,yeah i wasnt sure where he hurt it but he clearly catches a leg and goes for a takedown before he hurts his knee theres still a clear shift in the fight though where he stops looking to strike and without that shift i think he probably finishes max who had no reason to keep going other than pride
MMA,not_removed,nope tore it here
MMA,not_removed,and the same can be said for conor up to a point damn it now i want max to become champion its the only way i see a rematch happening
MMA,not_removed,i know but everyone knows one time was the one that changed music forever srsly tho can we still be friends if i happen to find some parts of that song weirdlyannoyingly catchy im not saying i listen to it on repeat for several hours of each day or anything but yeah edit just figured out the pun in what you said ive been exposed as a fake belieber
MMA,not_removed,someone overdub it with alistair and put it on a reem highlight reel
MMA,not_removed,i felt bad for max conor totally threw him off his game max was always a smart volume striker he was beating cub on the fight i thought he beat bermudez too but conor was the first person who absolutely outclassed max standing and i think holloway was a bit thrown by that nowadays i dont think it would matter but back then i think max was shaken by it and it hurt his performance
MMA,not_removed,i read it here
MMA,not_removed,he deserved to win the bermudez fight and i thought he very clearly won the garcia fight as did half the media way to downplay it
MMA,not_removed,i dont know geti it may be too late now to say sorry but then again never say never you know the downvotes are going to flow because of this exchange lol
MMA,not_removed,holy shit he looks so young
MMA,not_removed,maybe so but even if youre not shaken being outclassed is still being outclassed
MMA,not_removed,lol its fine i dont expect neanderthals who love such a brutal sport such as mma to appreciate the incredible artist nuances in biebs music
MMA,not_removed,dont mind the downvotes you should go and love yourself regardless
MMA,not_removed,agreed im just saying and its purely from maxs maneurisms and behavior during the fight it could totally be just conor obliterating him that his performance was made worse by not just being outclassed in striking but being mentally shook because of it max usually throws in volume drives forward is very aggressive in this fight he was tentative wasnt throwing a lot of combos really stuck to potshot counterstriking not trying to take anything away from conors win if it read that way conor dominating max was what made max so shook
MMA,not_removed,yeah agreed but i dont think thats any different to conors other opponents only difference is maxs chin held up but he was still bewildered by the power and variety of things coming at him happens all the time every fighter struggles to respond to someone that wins early trades and pushes the pace look at rda vs cerrone for example cerrone is no fool and hes won against a wide range of styles and strengths but that doesnt make him immune to just being shut down
MMA,not_removed,well to be fair pretty much everyone thats fought mayweather for the past years or so has gone the distance its not a bold prediction
MMA,not_removed,i feel bad for anyone who doesnt recognize skip is playing a character at this point
MMA,not_removed,skip bayless is a known retard more at
MMA,not_removed,michael landsberg and skip bayless are the same person
MMA,not_removed,man if the odds were close id put my house on it
MMA,not_removed,id love to see the fight but it couldnt be a straight boxing match include elbows and ufc gloves and it might just be different enough from boxing that it evens up the odds the closer it got to mma rules the better but i cant see mayweather agreeing to anything that wasnt very very close to normal boxing rules
MMA,not_removed,just stop thinking
MMA,not_removed,skip just wants the fight to occur make people think conor can win so he can bet on mayweather and make a lot of cash
MMA,not_removed,skip bayless is a joke having said that i think conor could go the distance against floyd conor wouldnt win but he could go the distance for sure
MMA,not_removed,how is conor going to survive rounds every jab he throws would be countered hard every left hand would miss or be countered floyd may not hit hard but he has enough speed and power to knock a guy out who hasnt even had a pro fight it is the punches you dont see that hurt the most i would be shocked if he survived two rounds tbh if floyd can toy with guys like canelo what do you think he would do to conor lol
MMA,not_removed,this is not even that stupid of an opinion by skips standards or compared to the mcgregor fans on youtube i had to have or separate conversations with mcg fans on youtube saying stuff like all it takes is one hit from conor and conor was an amateur boxing champ still never seen any proof of a boxing record of any kind the absolute worst comment was a guy telling me that mayweather has never seen a stance like conors and that since mayweather is only used to fighting boxers it would throw him off and he wouldnt know how to deal with it yes floyd mayweather would not know how to box a man with no pro boxing on his record this is akin to the mma guys would get killed in a real fight argument it blew my mind i know its youtube but i cant believe that someone could be so wildly ignorant of boxing but what this also told me is that mcg vs mayweather would probably break million ppvs because while we all would watch it there are actually a sizable amount of mcg fans who think he has a legit shot at koing the best boxer at an olympic boxer who has never had a pro loss and never been knocked down in his entire career they also completely discount the fact that conor could get tkod at any point so yeah this fight could actually happen realistically and the betting lines might end up way closer than they should
MMA,not_removed,dudeeee why we even having this discussion mma its conor boxing its mayweather thats all there is to it
MMA,not_removed,sounds about like what any other mcgregor fan would say
MMA,not_removed,none of them have zero professional boxing experience though
MMA,not_removed,i dont know anything about this guy thanks for clearing that up i havent taken a minute to do a google search to see who he was was he a radio guy or something i dont keep up with team sports
MMA,not_removed,so guys with sports shows are playing characters now our society is so fake it makes me sick
MMA,not_removed,wat oo
MMA,not_removed,with any luck chael will go on his show and troll the hell out of him like he used to do with landsberg
MMA,not_removed,i think they should do it as a kickboxing match with rules
MMA,not_removed,skip bayless is a joke hes playing a character to create a debate
MMA,not_removed,tell us more about your arguments in youtube comment sections
MMA,not_removed,mayweather said he wasnt fighting
MMA,not_removed,boxing match with gloves and we have a contest
MMA,not_removed,he had another show on espn with a guy named stephen a smith and theyd talk about all sports topics especially basketball its well known that they wereare both basically playing wwe versions of themselves
MMA,not_removed,no chance floyd takes that a few of those leg kicks conor threw against nate and hes done
MMA,not_removed,ok
MMA,not_removed,no we dont people dont realize the level that mayweather is at conor got hit by mendes and rocked by diaz mayweather wouldnt even been touched
MMA,not_removed,this shit has made espn commentary pretty much unwatchable for me but i guess it works for a lot of people
MMA,not_removed,you dont realize the difference between mma gloves and boxing gloves taking away the larger boxing gloves changes your defensive options as well as opening up more offensive ones its harder to get through the guard with larger gloveseasier to shell and its much easier to roll to deflect blows this is much harder with mma gloves which is why you dont often see these types of defenses in mma its not near as cut and dry as you think it is
MMA,not_removed,god i love that
MMA,not_removed,that scream was brutal sounded like he broke a rib
MMA,not_removed,httpsstreamablecomfhnq
MMA,not_removed,awesome
MMA,not_removed,fucking heard it clear as day from the seats in the nose bleeds as well
MMA,not_removed,first time i posted this your words were front snap kicks get me going they get me going too
MMA,not_removed,undisputed goat song to come out of australia sometimes it gets played at work and my day just gets better âº
MMA,not_removed,that fight was a really horrible decision from memory i had noke clearly winning
MMA,not_removed,it is in the ufc too but ive usually only seen it applied to submissions maybe the ref just goofed and forgot
MMA,not_removed,the ufc does not make the rules commissions do
MMA,not_removed,ive never heard of this being the case examples
MMA,not_removed,im not sure about mma promotions but i know if you do it in most bjj competitions they will count it as a verbal tap
MMA,not_removed,check out joe warren in bellator i find this hilarious because he talks himself up so much the baddest man on the planet and takes the loss so badly
MMA,not_removed,sergey seems to have some pretty accurate hands and he throws some nice kicks but once he gets into swang n bang mode he gets pretty reckless and just kinda throws and hopes he overwhelms his opponent he has a good base with good takedowns and always looks to punish takedown attempts with strikes i think he has some serious potential
MMA,not_removed,these are one of those rocky or punisher movie villians
MMA,not_removed,thing is he just had his first fight years ago and hes years old and actually comes from a fairly high level wrestling background plus hes a lean pounds and also stupid fast for a hw
MMA,not_removed,because the main artery carrying blood to the brain is cut off
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,tickets are gonna be hundreds of dollars and the view on tv is far superior to any view in the arena but the environment with the irish first ny event and msg in general is gonna be massive thats what youd be paying for i mean the irish were stacked outside msg for the fucking presser saw huge crowds on my way to the path this ones gonna be huge
MMA,not_removed,go to that event if you can id give anything to go tickets for the weigh in are free but you have to apply for them
MMA,not_removed,its definitely worth going to one especially one of this magnitude the atmosphere when different fighters music hits is not even describable i prefer the comfort of my couch surrounded by friends food and drink and watching on the big screen normally but msg and conor you should definitely go im in the midwest so we rarely get great cards within traveling distance but ill never regret paying to see fedor fight when he was in chicago if chicago ever gets a big card again i would go but i wouldnt go to sit in the nose bleeds
MMA,not_removed,keep doing what you do man dont let the masses fool you this is not one of your most informative but it is always worth it trying to find patterns a possible point of interest mapping finishing patternsfight time possibly even coupled with career trajectory
MMA,not_removed,props for putting so much work into this but there isnt too much that can be learned from it obviously similar finish types will be closely correlated
MMA,not_removed,how the fuck are you supposed to read that
MMA,not_removed,im going to link this comment section the next time somebody gets too fartsniffy about rmma being some sort of superior breed of fan
MMA,not_removed,its too difficult to understand there isnt much here to be honest i get the concept of seeing where one goes but at the same time i think it would have been more useful if it was percentage of finishes based on fighter base and what specific technique is most commonly used then if you added that time line it would make a lot more sense to most people
MMA,not_removed,it doesnt make sense to use a graph to show the finishes it looks cool but i doubt many people will be able to read it it would be better to use a pie chart or a histogram
MMA,not_removed,what is this im not some code breaker fuck this graph is totally useless if no one can read it
MMA,not_removed,whoever wasted their time in this must feel smart
MMA,not_removed,i spent min trying to find a pattern and figure it outwaste of my time
MMA,not_removed,to clarify the links do not form a timeline they are finishes that are used together by fighters frequently like armbar and triangle armbar being used by the same people
MMA,not_removed,so im still a little confused at what the point of that is is the statement so if this guy is good at this technique you should also be weary of these
MMA,not_removed,even if palhares mostly wins by heel hook and has a few kneebars he is still likely to be really good at straightankle locks and toeholds even though he has never won a fight by one
MMA,not_removed,ah i see so youre looking at the categories a fighter has a finish in and seeing in what other categories their most likely to have finishes in based on the data you collected
MMA,not_removed,yep and i see that there are major groups kickboxing pure bjj and chokes from top position with lots of other finishes like decisions in between
MMA,not_removed,dick stencil lol
MMA,not_removed,bet on bisping his son picked anderson aswell
MMA,not_removed,bispings son browses rmma
MMA,not_removed,i think rockhold has autism beautiful autism hes the rain man of dick pranks solid engineering choice of materials reasoning about the wind impressive
MMA,not_removed,yeah and bisping got knocked out lol still won but it doesnt change the fact that his son was sorta right
MMA,not_removed,he didnt get knocked out he got knocked down huge difference silva got knocked down three times that fight
MMA,not_removed,this clip will alway be classic this is when dana ceased having second thoughts about his strikeforce purchase
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,gsp didnt have a whole lot of exciting moments during his second title reign but all of his defenses had an aura around them that not many fights had during every defense you were in awe and wondering who was gonna be the guy who could counter his skills it may have not been a constant edge of your seat thrillfest like a shane carwin fight short as those tended to be but they were exciting in their own way and a way that is much more rare
MMA,not_removed,someone posted a clip of gsp slamming a guys head into the ground over and over that got a holy shit out of me
MMA,not_removed,there are plenty of those on youtube i can give you though
MMA,not_removed,i always felt bad about this for bj bj has kind of become a joke but i think he pretty amazing to have fought in five different weight classes he is a damn decent fighter i always thought gsp should have gotten more flack for what happened
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,goofy title
MMA,not_removed,whats with the needlessly creepy music ð
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah youre that guy i have tagged as big riggs alt account
MMA,not_removed,why riot stoolgate was bad tim kennedy grabbing gloves was worse vaseline was a mistake now after years i think i speak for many when i say we dont care anymore the moment i stopped caring was when i watched the video of bj bringing his old ass momma before the ac to snitch that gsps on steroids as well it was so hilariously awful worse than anderson silvas marco gave me a blue vial from thailand meeting with the ac wheres your proof mr stpierre is on steroids proof what proof i dont need no stinking proof just look at him i get fat inbetween fights he doesnt
MMA,not_removed,dude has such an axe to grind and of all the things
MMA,not_removed,jesus christ this is sad
MMA,not_removed,if you were outraged over the title then you should riot over the comments
MMA,not_removed,not to mention that cornermen were absolutely allowed to bring in and apply vaseline to their fighters at the time did they go overboard maybe do i buy phil nurse saying the back rub was part of a regular breathing routine sure people really need to move on
MMA,not_removed,man was the shit i looked forward to nights in i was about at the time with a few cans and watched this shit on eurosport on fridays
MMA,not_removed,wow look at hunts face when he eats the successive knees he thrives on it he knows hes about to hurt le banner amazing confidence
MMA,not_removed,mark hunt looks like a big blonde bj penn in the thumbnail
MMA,not_removed,facebook rants aside how could you possibly not be a mark hunt fan
MMA,not_removed,jab hook jab hook jab hook jab hook dead
MMA,not_removed,the normally calm collected mild mannered mark hunt of today was a fucking savage in his nsync days
MMA,not_removed,sticks his chin up and taunts him seconds later gets the knockout so iconic
MMA,not_removed,and without all the boring ass grappling shit or pounding on your opponent when theyre down winners won by real skills
MMA,not_removed,my favourite videogif of hunto is when he ate a brutal left head kick from cro cop and didnt even flinch
MMA,not_removed,ask cro cop
MMA,not_removed,lack of self awareness gonna getcha son
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,hmm i couldnt get through
MMA,not_removed,evidently not the one i was talking about even there he doesnt really look phased though
MMA,not_removed,yeah im sure he meant to fall on his ass
MMA,not_removed,where did i say that clearly knocked him down but evidently he was nowhere near going out looked completely unphased in his facial expression
MMA,not_removed,this is legitimately posted by a retarded person
MMA,not_removed,i wont engage ill just report
MMA,not_removed,why troll on an alt account if the trolls are worthy
MMA,not_removed,i dunno he lays out some pretty well reasoned points considering english doesnt seem to be his first or for that matter third or fourth language
MMA,not_removed,the ama has ended httpimgurcomasnjde
MMA,not_removed,whatd you think of veta and anastasias fight i took vetas back one time so i think id do pretty well in bellator womens division problem is im a male also good luck
MMA,not_removed,what were your thoughts when you were fighting ruth and she just kept on getting out of your chokes
MMA,not_removed,if you could mimic the style of one fighter perfectly who would it be
MMA,not_removed,in what field is your degree
MMA,not_removed,did you pursue a career in mma while still a fulltime student or did you pick it up after youd gotten your masters degree if the former is true how tough was it to find time for both if the latters true do you wish youd found mma earlier
MMA,not_removed,how is the business side of things going for you fans hear a lot about struggling fighters barely getting by we also hear a lot about sponsorships in bellator being more lucrative than the ufctrue thanks and good luck
MMA,not_removed,whats your favorite thing about getting punched in the face for a living
MMA,not_removed,what was your reaction before and after when you realized you were fighting a soccer mom
MMA,not_removed,whos your favourite mma fighter besides yourself
MMA,not_removed,ive never heard of youwhy should i watch your fights
MMA,not_removed,what are some things that you think bellator could or should do to bridge the gap between the ufc and themselves personally one that that i feel helps is having a womens a flyweight division since the ufc doesnt have one also loved your performance against rebecca ruth that was my first time seeing you fight best of luck to your in your future fights
MMA,not_removed,do you drink alcoholic beverages constantlybetween campsnever or whatever and if yes what are your preferred choices
MMA,not_removed,howzit ilima shout out from hilo what made you join an mma gym and how far along in your training were you when you realized you could compete professionally
MMA,not_removed,whats the process for a weight cut like and how does one get into amateur mma is it too late for me as year old white belt in bjj
MMA,not_removed,when do you think your next fight will be do you still want to fight yankova next
MMA,not_removed,who is your dream fight against
MMA,not_removed,what has been your biggest hurdle to overcome when fighting in the cage
MMA,not_removed,are you a bacon or sausage kind of person
MMA,not_removed,if bellator offered you a fight in japan for rizin would you take it
MMA,not_removed,ilima when are you gonna go on the joe rogan podcast
MMA,not_removed,thanks for tuning in everyone this was my very first reddit experience and it was pretty rad i have to start getting ready for work but hopefully ill be on here more often shoooooooooots
MMA,not_removed,did you have trouble getting fights early on
MMA,not_removed,who you got for joanna karolina
MMA,not_removed,if the ufc implemented a flyweight division and signed you is there anyone in particular youd like to fight
MMA,not_removed,what are your ufc picks
MMA,not_removed,any gals in the ufc you want to fight
MMA,not_removed,who dont you want to fight
MMA,not_removed,is there legit sexual tension between you and anastasia or were you just trying to mess with her
MMA,not_removed,if edmond tarverdyan was talking shit and started approaching you post fight how would you hit him what technique
MMA,not_removed,have you ever eaten one of those gigantic burritos that your coach posts on instagram manoloeats
MMA,not_removed,ho tita u like scrap already
MMA,not_removed,did you get into any fights while you were pursuing your degree is that what pushed you into the octagon
MMA,not_removed,as someone who has never cut weight what is like mentally
MMA,not_removed,would you be hopeful that perhaps in the future bellator may instate a belt especially since its closest competitor the ufc is lacking that division
MMA,not_removed,who is the one fighter in the ufc you most want to fight
MMA,not_removed,you havent lost who do you reckon could beat you kicks to the head thai style or karate style
MMA,not_removed,link a vid of one of your fights
MMA,not_removed,who in the ufc would you like to fight if you could choose right now also why is your cage name spelt with an i and not an e
MMA,not_removed,so awesome thank you so much what school was this at
MMA,not_removed,i really did think it could go either way but then again i dont think my fight iq is very high and i never know what the judges are really looking for
MMA,not_removed,all i could think about was how tired my forearms werefrom trying to take her down the entire first roundand how i wasnt going to be able to finish her with a rnc the minute she started standing i started adjusting to try for an armbar but then i recognized that she left her neck open again so i went for the rnc one more time shes a beast i cant believe she fought that last choke off for so long
MMA,not_removed,probably joanna j i love how relentless she is on her feet
MMA,not_removed,i did my bachelors in liberal studies where i majored in cultural anthropology and my masters was in liberals arts and sciences with a focus on indigenous issues
MMA,not_removed,i joined the gym when i finished my undergrad and continued to compete as an amateur while i was a fulltime graduate student it wasnt until i received my masters degree that i turned pro it was pretty hard balancing both especially because i was taking units per semester as a grad student training and working fulltime fortunately i had awesome professors who were pretty understanding when i had a fight coming up and my gym had classes at all times of the day so i could work training into my schedule as a result i finished my program within three semesters and i was able to fight almost every other month needless to say as soon as i graduated i said i was going to take a few months off before job searching because i wanted to relax and just focus on training that was when we decided to go pro it was difficult to balance everything but it was something i wanted to do and i went after it and kept grinding i actually wish i had found mma sooner though because i feel like i started late i started in sorry for the novel lol
MMA,not_removed,one of the biggest things that ive learned from all of this is that it truly is a business from your social media to your sponsors to your interactions with fans and staff etc its all a business im slowly learning the ropes of everything for up and coming fighters like myself the sponsorships in bellator could potentially be much more lucrative than the ufc sponsorship tier thing they do for that i am super grateful
MMA,not_removed,im not at a desk from
MMA,not_removed,i also love being able to represent hawaii the support i get from everyone back home is amazing and always makes me cry before all of my fights
MMA,not_removed,she wasnt a soccer mom lol she doesnt even have kids the media just dubbed her as the soccer mom i actually have seen her fight before and she was super scrappy i expected her to come forward and try to push me against the cage because she did that in her last two fights
MMA,not_removed,ive always been a big fan of cat zingano and my teammate liz carmouche i love their fight style the way they carry themselves and how respectful they are of their opponents
MMA,not_removed,she kod soccer mom
MMA,not_removed,never really thought of that loli guess you should watch my fights because im part of the new wave of up and coming fighters my pro debut was also pretty controversial so my fights since have peaked the interest of many viewers
MMA,not_removed,what do you mean bridge the gap
MMA,not_removed,yes im a drinker lol when im not in camp ill drink probably three times a week when im in camp i limit it to once a week if that and i typically stop drinking entirely weeks out i like my beer and my dirty vodka martinis but if im trying to be healthy i do vodka soda
MMA,not_removed,howzit braddah i originally joined the gym because i wanted to lose weight i gained about lbs in college so once i finished my undergrad i told myself i was going to get back into shape i ended up doing my first amateur fight about months into training and then i went pro about a year later my career has definitely been accelerated but in the words of brandon wolffe one of my mma mentors with wmma you have to strike while the irons hot
MMA,not_removed,i walk about lbs within my fighting weight when im preparing for a fight i like to walk within lbs of my fighting weight and by the week of weighins i like to be about lbs out i cut those remaining lbs by sweating it out either in the sauna or the bath its really all about eating a clean diet and knowing how your body responds to everything we didnt quite get it down until my second pro fight if youre serious about getting into mma its never too late talk to your instructors at your gym see if they know any local promotions see if they will be willing to work with you not sure if your gym offers mma classestraining good luck
MMA,not_removed,hopefully before the end of the year i still want yankova but dont know when that might be i saw that she just got surgery so i think she might be recovering for a while sending her posi vibes
MMA,not_removed,honestly this is going to sound so weirdbut probably my main training partner liz carmouche lol weve actually talked about it beforewhat would happen if we fought each other would we brutalize each other would we feel bad who would be in our corner lmao thats my sister though we would probably fight to the death lol
MMA,not_removed,believing in myself i never think im good enough to be where i am
MMA,not_removed,bacon only if its limp though lol
MMA,not_removed,if bellator let me do it and my coaches approved then i would love to do it i love japan and would love to go back as an adult i went when i was
MMA,not_removed,au revoir thanks for the ama
MMA,not_removed,not at all since wmma is on the rise a lot of promotions were pumped to have a girls fight on the card i started my amateur career with xplode fight series a local promotion in san diego they dont have the best reputation especially after my soccer mom fight went viral but they were my favorite promotion to fight for it was raw it was gritty and they always found me a fight as an amateur that cage experience was critical for my growth as a fighter i have nothing negative to say about xfs and im super appreciative of their help in getting me to where i am today
MMA,not_removed,there was a lot of pressure on me for my bellator debut especially from the viral community however the pressure that i felt the most was from the mma community and other fighters my main goal was to prove to them that i was legitimate i didnt particularly care about the internet trolls but i just wanted to be respected within the mma community i didnt think that i was going to gain the respect of viewers just from my first or even my second bellator fight but after my win at dynamite ii over rebecca ruth who is an amazing fighter and person i definitely felt as if i had done enough to shake the soccer mom stigma i mean it will definitely follow me aroundwhich im totally okay withbut i think people have started to see that i can fight and i belong in bellator
MMA,not_removed,i want a boyfriend who i dont fight with lol
MMA,not_removed,i think there is who wouldnt want to make out with her she also giggles and blushes when people ask her about me lol
MMA,not_removed,in college when i was blacked out at in the morning yes now not so much lol
MMA,not_removed,faka lehs go i gon lick somebodeh
MMA,not_removed,as in fights outside of the ring never lol ive actually never been in a street fight before
MMA,not_removed,imagine cutting out all sugary and fat and tasty foods you crave that right then you cut out all food and suddenly the healthy bland stuff doesnt sound too bad then you cut out water and all of sudden you dont care about the food anymore you just want a sip of water then you get into the sauna or hot bath and all you want to do is get out and feel cold air or cold water on your skin its a very draining process but fortunately ive never had a bad cut i make sure to monitor my weight cut early on because ive seen what it does to fighters and i never want to experience that mental anxiety ive seen grown ass men cry because of the cut
MMA,not_removed,i am incredibly hopeful in bellator reinstating the belt and am waiting for that call
MMA,not_removed,i go into all of my fights with an open heart anyone can beat me it just depends who shows up that day thai style
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,my full name is ilimalei macfarlane my first name is hawaiian in the hawaiian language vowels are pronounced differently than your standard english language the i is pronounced phonetically as ee hope i answered your question lol
MMA,not_removed,i dont think the judges know what theyre looking for either
MMA,not_removed,thats really cool although hope you wont be needing it too soon
MMA,not_removed,ilima tryin to hype up that rematch
MMA,not_removed,zingano is awesome shes my favorite female fighter too love aggressive fighters hope to see her with a belt one day either way shell always be a true champ in my eyes she never breaks and is always game
MMA,not_removed,murdered
MMA,not_removed,should have been more specific i meant things to make bellator stand out from the other promotions like wsof legacy etc and make it continue to grow in popularity and possibly become just as much of a household name as the ufc
MMA,not_removed,he means the gap in popularity so they become closers in popularity and viewership
MMA,not_removed,thats crazy congrats on your success so far and good luck in the future ill be watching out for you shoots m
MMA,not_removed,so your cut isnt that wild ive heard stories about pound cuts and i have no idea how its possible i roll at a gracie barra academy and they also offer muy thai classes which conflict with the fundamentals of bjj but im holding off on that until blue belt so i can attend the advanced bjj classes and the muy thai thanks for taking the time to answer questions here
MMA,not_removed,did you hear about pluto thats messed up right
MMA,not_removed,what

MMA,not_removed,you took a class on insane clown posse
MMA,not_removed,dude dont be a dick to people doing amas for us
MMA,not_removed,gotcha i think they are definitely on their way to bridging the gap not only with their inclusion of a flyweight division but also the signing of a lot of big names such as benson henderson and rory macdonald they also have been doing an amazing job putting on a bunch of shows putting on international shows and starting up bellator kickboxing im excited to see this organization grow and have the utmost confidence that it will
MMA,not_removed,a lot of guys will cut lbs but womens bodies are different we typically dont cut that much because we cant for a lot of guys thats totally normal
MMA,not_removed,he wanted to know how magnets work
MMA,not_removed,it was a peer counseling class lolbut its funny you should reference icp because were gonna do a juggalo bar crawl for my coachs birthday lol
MMA,not_removed,jesus fuck wouldnt know how to manage that
MMA,not_removed,juggalo bar crawl explain and expand for full marks pls
MMA,not_removed,as a juggalo i am curious what that entails
MMA,not_removed,the only thing the ufc did for mcgregor is not get in his way if cody wants to be mcgregor level he has to do it himself
MMA,not_removed,learn to speak
MMA,not_removed,cody looks like a credit card scammer version of mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,brain transplant no one will ever unironically quote cody
MMA,not_removed,needs babyface urijah faber to be his manager and cut his promos for him not every time tj check the record bud
MMA,not_removed,release a sex tape
MMA,not_removed,nobody can be conor but conor as for cody he would need to either come across as more well spoken or speak less and accentuate his strong pointsthe dedication the kindness and good heart he shows when he speaks about that kid etc aside from that he doesnt have the charisma of a mcgregor but he has his own personality and an exciting style so probably his best bet is to keep it simple and short when driving his talking points home and put the hype on his fighting ability and performances
MMA,not_removed,knock out dana white instant legend
MMA,not_removed,i dont know man hes an amazing fighter but he is so fucking cringy
MMA,not_removed,theres nothing he can do hes not the next mcgregor hes cody garbrandt and thats ok â¤
MMA,not_removed,keep winning whilst playing off his tuf encounter with conor to create a massive feud basically the goal being to make himself the best and most lucrative opponent for mcgregor in the ufc then beat mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,he needs proper pr training unlike conor cody doesnt have the natural gift of the gab
MMA,not_removed,neck tattoo removal i could never be with that
MMA,not_removed,its impossible this sounds corny but i dont think anyone will come close to being like conor for many many years
MMA,not_removed,wear a gucci mink coat and show up late to press conferences
MMA,not_removed,just keep knocking people out
MMA,not_removed,nice try uriah get back to work
MMA,not_removed,develop an accent and talk a lot of shit and keep on sleeping fuckers in bantamweight
MMA,not_removed,i honestly think he can be the peoples champ kinda shtick the whole thing he had going on with that sick kid is really touching and he seems like a nice dude he isnt smartwitty enough to be a trash talker like conor so i can see him being super popular if he just keeps being nice impossible not to like the guy
MMA,not_removed,conor is the first to conor himself cody will be a star but never to macs level mac is a once in a lifetime kind of star he is bigger then mma
MMA,not_removed,knock challengers out
MMA,not_removed,get a second brain cell to rub against the first when he speaks on camera a lot of what mcgregor says isnt particularly advanced or impressive but it works in terms of selling himself garbrandt has not yet come off as entertaining in a good way anyways during an interview on the other hand if his performances are all as impressive as the cruz fight he can hit anderson silva nick diaz levels in another few fights
MMA,not_removed,get rid of his disgusting neck tatto
MMA,not_removed,ali is that you
MMA,not_removed,shut his mouth and do his talking in the cage without his mouth
MMA,not_removed,i think he can become really famous but he lacks the charisma of connor connor seems to be really smart when it comes to show biz while cody you know cody he really feels like a teenager when he speaks
MMA,not_removed,be irish talk shit and keep winning
MMA,not_removed,he wont ever get to conors level
MMA,not_removed,he needs a lot more charisma a lot more wit and an entire nation of fans in other words he needs to appeal to peoples national pride which he has barely any chance of doing conor had the whole first irish man to do really well in the ufc and as he kept winning more and more people were talking about him here in ireland plus the irish are just naturally fanatical in their support of national sports teams athletes etc there have been fighters which were more marketable than cody in the past and more successfull and they never got anyhere near conors level of popularity i dont think we will see a fighter reach this level for a while yet especially while conor is still around stealing the headlights
MMA,not_removed,get some charisma instead of coming off as a meathead
MMA,not_removed,find out how to trash talk properly also look into tattoo removal
MMA,not_removed,knocking people out isnt enough he needs a transcendent moment as he does not have a transcendent personality maybe publicly tie himself to a cause greater than himself lie cancer prevention
MMA,not_removed,knock out tj talk shit on mic post fight calling out mighty mouse ko mighty mouse
MMA,not_removed,he needs to get his face out there he needs to be seen he needs to be a great interview ala chael or a good soundbite ala mcgregor finish multiple fights that fit into a gif ala rousey
MMA,not_removed,making an dublin card for him on his third fight and giving him a title shot off a siver win is a little more than not getting in his way granted they only did it because he already had buzz
MMA,not_removed,i did not notice anything improper about the way he said that maybe if you are nit picking he said face of ufc instead of face of the ufc
MMA,not_removed,cruz you have a chance of touching me garbrant chance all i need is
MMA,not_removed,lol i love what random things stick in the mma lexicon check the record bud
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,so a valet
MMA,not_removed,no love and pvz sex tape does million ppv buys gauranteed
MMA,not_removed,now im wondering how garbrandts pillow talk will be in comparison to his trash talk
MMA,not_removed,probably the only way if there is one as unlikely as it sounds even if the fight was made which has a slim chance he has an even slimmer chance of winning
MMA,not_removed,everyone has an accent
MMA,not_removed,i agree with this i know ill get hate for saying this by conor fans but his whole thing is sort of a gimmick dont get me wrong its great but i doubt he acts that way he puts it on for the fans and to sell fights even john kavanagh says hes nothing like this outside of mma with cody i feel like what you see is what you get when hes upset or emotional hes genuinely feeling those emotions and he doesnt have the power to control them at the time his back story is great broken home selling drugs he grinds for what he wants and he became the fastest ufc champ all with hard work dedication hes actually such a sweet dude i wouldnt want him to beact like conor
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor is proof that even the most terrible atrocious tattoos can be overcome
MMA,not_removed,hahaha too real
MMA,not_removed,casual fans dont give a shit about mm hed need to keep winning against huge names and stop a terror attack
MMA,not_removed,you think hes going to get popular by calling out a much smaller guy from a lower division
MMA,not_removed,they did that because conor was already bringing in loads of irish fans so it was worth it for them cody is not bringing in the same amount of fans now that conor was in his fight
MMA,not_removed,true its common thing they do for fighters they like especially ko artist gabrant porier had been given that treatment multiple times and then lost choi was moved rather fast up the ranks
MMA,not_removed,dont forget siver was after the super impressive poirier ko i agree with you though that the ufc did more than allow conors ascent
MMA,not_removed,not the op but cody
MMA,not_removed,flea on a string
MMA,not_removed,why do i imagine urijah faber rooting for him in the bedroom with that goofy smile holding an orange for some reason
MMA,not_removed,now im wondering how garbrandts pillow talk will be in comparison to his trash talk theyll be busting on your face itll be fun i hope so im going to eat everything you got
MMA,not_removed,whats with the downvotes
MMA,not_removed,i bet ur fun at parties
MMA,not_removed,conors tats range from meh to iconic they arent terrible thiughm
MMA,not_removed,i like the gorilla the tigers kinda generic and the name is generic as well but that gorilla is legit idek whats on his forearm though sorry but knuckle tats are always gonna leave a bad first impression then theres that awful new tattoo hes got
MMA,not_removed,yeah the ufc can give you some backing but they wont win fights for you
MMA,not_removed,wow im dumb
MMA,not_removed,dont call my girl a flea
MMA,not_removed,were at the point on reddit where you could just write a script to replace percent of comments
MMA,not_removed,i like anthony bourdain narrating cruz faber is truly one of the best longest running realest rivalries in mma i know a lot of people think faber will get washed but i wouldnt be surprised if faber puts everything he has left into this one and makes it a really competitive fight
MMA,not_removed,this is probably my favorite rivalry in mma
MMA,not_removed,doms got that voice tone like the csi guys just outed him as the murdered and hes finally confessing to the detective why he did it after denying it for a long time
MMA,not_removed,great production
MMA,not_removed,whats the ending song
MMA,not_removed,am i the only one who thinks this is going to be a squash match dom vs dj was the fight to make instead we get dj vs reis wtf and dom vs faber in another boring decision ufc really shit the bed on this one
MMA,not_removed,id like to know as well i keep looking but i cant find it edit google has never failed me so far this is frustrating
MMA,not_removed,if you thought cruz vs faber ii was boring i dont know if the ufc has what youre looking for
MMA,not_removed,dom vs dj was the fight to make
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse has no plans to leave until he has accomplished what he has set out to do breaking silvas record is the priority for him and he has no reason to move outside of his weight class meanwhile cruz is a who has fought as high as he doesnt have the ability to come down to to fight dj so while cruz vs johnson is certainly possible on paper its never going to happen you cant expect a champion to move out of his weight class to fight someone else for no discernible reason
MMA,not_removed,god its that same retarded attitude that has kept great fights like jones vs velasquez and rousey vs cyborg from ever happening stop coddling fighters even if he does break it it will have a huge asterisk next to it as it will have been a meaningless streak padded with a bunch of mostly untalented nobodies the only two on his record of any note are job and cejudo the other legitimate talent he faced dom he lost to so why wouldnt anyone want to watch that fight people whine and bitch about a khabib vs rda rematch yet dont clamor for this fight ridiculous and by the by dj has fought at before and seeing as how dj has no business fighting in anymore i think the time is right to move up and put his skills to the test
MMA,not_removed,these guys are legit fighters that just look bad against the arguably he has fought some good fighters and some bad but hes mostly embarrassed the good ones again he does not have to move out of the weight class he currently holds the belt for for that matter neither does cruz cruz cant move down and a fight at means nothing to mighty mouse it wouldnt be for his belt and it wouldnt be cruzs as long as he has something to chase at strawweight the only thing this accomplishes is holding up two divisions while two champions fight a meaningless fight if he breaks or fails to break silvas record i would love to see him move up to unfortunately by that time i doubt cruz is still around either way im not seeing how you could have watched cruz vs faber ii and expect anything more from johnson vs cruz ii both are high volume fast moving match ups i cant see how one would bore you and the other one doesnt i dont think your argument is retarded but in an organized sport the goal is to make the matchups within the boundaries they need to be made in everyone flipped shit when conor left his weight class to fight elsewhere this is the same scenario except dj has elected to actually defend his belt
MMA,not_removed,conor was fighting in a weight class he shouldnt have been cutting to
MMA,not_removed,i checked where the empty sections of the venue were when i was seating in the nosebleeds then in between rounds and of the kim vs saffiedine fight i went to this section and just walked through the control guys when they were busy due to the influx of people i was lucky and found seats that mustve been unsold because no one ever came to claim them seems like a few people did that since i saw people getting moved from seats that were not theirs
MMA,not_removed,dats it gonna start buying crappy seat then just move to the front
MMA,not_removed,that would have got you nosebleeds if it was
MMA,not_removed,nice one how was the atmosphere kind of weird that the event was not sold out huh
MMA,not_removed,thats fuckin illegal
MMA,not_removed,story please
MMA,not_removed,lucky guy must have been an awesome experience happy new year
MMA,not_removed,so the arena wasnt sold out
MMA,not_removed,nice this happened to me and my other friends at ufc except the hostess told us to do it since we were exactly and there were unclaimed seats i think they refunded them or something our seats were traded for ones they were rows from the front where the fighters walked in
MMA,not_removed,what did rondas blood smell like
MMA,not_removed,shhh dont give it away
MMA,not_removed,i paid for floor seats awhile ago and they were awful you couldnt see over the stage when we walked in we stood about where your seats would be and they were better than ours
MMA,not_removed,idol
MMA,not_removed,second time ive done it did it for conor vs diaz and sat in seats that were similar to these today however i was not as wasted and was able to enjoy the fights much more
MMA,not_removed,me and my dad have always done this for baseball games lol
MMA,not_removed,pretty amazing people cheered ronda and cody so hard amanda got some respect in the end i was sitting across from the team alpha male guys and they were celebrating like mad men i could see faber benavides fili and ishihara going nuts woodley was with them and seemed just as stoked
MMA,not_removed,no shit uncle dana gonna want the difference in cash from op
MMA,not_removed,added a comment that i used to respond to someone in my previous post
MMA,not_removed,it was great i was very lucky my biggest win were indeed the seats i placed a bet that ronda vs amanda would go to over rounds and that cody would win not sure if i even broke even yet
MMA,not_removed,absolutely agree regarding amanda she is an absolute sweetheart pretty baffling how being the world champ she was at the laundromat doing laundry on christmas day i hope she got paid some tonight she made easy work out of ronda
MMA,not_removed,no it was a sell out those seats could have been could be casino comps or someone not being able to make it if you look at the previous attendance from tmobile arena ufc nunes vs rousey â attendance ufc tate vs nunes â attendance ufc diaz vs mcgregor â attendance
MMA,not_removed,floors are terrible if one person stands up it fucks things for everyone else lots of tension out there too big motherfuckers angry they shelled out so much to not see everything taking their frustration out on anyone around them that says something they dont like best seats in the house imo are halfway up the first bowl near where the center line is
MMA,not_removed,you should delete this stuff so people can keep doing it the more popular it gets the more regulated it will become
MMA,not_removed,you know whats weird is i have always liked watching baseball in the upper stands id probably trade with you
MMA,not_removed,i cant remember the last time i was so envious of an experience good for you man nice way to end a bizarre year
MMA,not_removed,that sounds so cool
MMA,not_removed,youre right and not even kidding some guy kept putting a midget on his shoulders blocking my view lol it was awful
MMA,not_removed,this trick has literally been around for a hundred years why do you think ushers exist
MMA,not_removed,i dont think ive ever not done this at a sporting event not exactly a big secret
MMA,not_removed,there are sheep and there are wolves you can tell a sheep how to be a wolf but he is still a sheep everyone will read about it but the same amount of people will actually do it people are generally nice and dont want the confrontation this could bring
MMA,not_removed,ronda walked away with million
MMA,not_removed,yeah i was at and that event had patches of seats that were completely empty which was not the case in this one
MMA,not_removed,that really is a comical imagine mentally
MMA,not_removed,the nhl are much more on the ball when it comes to catching people switch seats its like theyre just waiting for you
MMA,not_removed,its why halftime exists the first half is intel the second half is enjoyment
MMA,not_removed,if she cant see past your stutter shes never going to love you for you thats real talk
MMA,not_removed,i wish i had half the bravado as malvo i was honestly thinking of a scene in season of better call saul when i typed that season of fargo was bad ass because some roads you shouldnt go down because maps used to say there be dragons here now they dont but that dont mean the dragons arent there lorne malvo
MMA,not_removed,that show is so good the scene im thinking about is towards the end of season he is a kid and a guy comes in his dads shop and pulls a fast one he tells a better version of my statement to jimmy and seems to kind of inspire him
MMA,not_removed,im hoping ross can pull out the win itd be nice to see
MMA,not_removed,nice little card being built
MMA,not_removed,dan hooker is an exciting action fighter but has fallen short of the elite this is his chance to get a good win over a solid competitor in ross ill be interested to see how this goes ross doesnt tend to win fights where he doesnt get his hands going in the opening stanza
MMA,not_removed,defiantly looking forward to this scrap
MMA,not_removed,two classy warrior going at each other cannot wait
MMA,not_removed,can roas pose another fight by this point shouldnt he have a win by pure luck some how
MMA,not_removed,same jesus i feel like hes always circling the drain but i like him as a fighter
MMA,not_removed,one of the big issues with this is that their biggest ratings usually come in around the et hour and the main fight finished at or around then so they didnt pull in the people waiting for news crowd nor the people only interested in seeing one main event fight the rating was basically a consequence of a quick finish
MMA,not_removed,if the ufc wants to pull more viewers perhaps they should consider those who pay for fightpass re negotiate that shitty exclusive fox deal and give fightpass fans every fight night for price of subscription
MMA,not_removed,why was that the main event why not arovski vs the predator or the cerrone masvidal one
MMA,not_removed,many reasons as i see it pena and shevy have no name recognition really holmshevy was like months ago and they didnt exactly do anything to help valentina become more famous this is the one weekend this month when there is no nfl playoffs if youre a family this is the weekend to do anything else besides watching sports especially with the superbowl on next week nfl pro bowl was on someone watched that
MMA,not_removed,no thanks id rather get the fight nights for free
MMA,not_removed,i dunno about that fox is available to literally everyone for free while fight pass has a pay wall i dont see a card like this doing better behind a pay wall
MMA,not_removed,for all the tech savvy redditors you get which arent going to be many more than already subscribe to fight pass you are going to lose all the famlies who have no interest in streaming sports not evryone is going to hook up a computer to their tv
MMA,not_removed,i watched the whole event on fightpass live its not hard
MMA,not_removed,winner gets a title shot against nunes
MMA,not_removed,cable costs money
MMA,not_removed,i speak as a cord cutter so my view may be skewed
MMA,not_removed,it is in ireland ufc made a deal with bt sports and you cant buy ppvs through fight pas anymore
MMA,not_removed,was it for an interim belt
MMA,not_removed,ufc on fox cards are on free tv in the states the fight night cards on require a cable subscription
MMA,not_removed,fox sports is already factored into the purchase decision what youre suggesting is on top of that fans pay a premium to watch and its not happening
MMA,not_removed,as a cord cutter you should be able to plug the coax into your tv and watch them free
MMA,not_removed,nah but need main event to be round scheduled
MMA,not_removed,yep a cable scrip is pretty pricey
MMA,not_removed,i meant for the price of the subscription to fightpass not any additional
MMA,not_removed,nope fox sports has it locked up at least in houston
MMA,not_removed,do you have any idea how much that would cost if they didnt get foxs million annually
MMA,not_removed,i had no idea that was even a thing your local station is terrible
MMA,not_removed,fox sports are not supported by local affiliatesunless its a locally televised event you gotta have cable to get fox sport content
MMA,not_removed,this wasnt on fox sports this was on fox you can go to walmart and buy a antenna for your tv and get fox over the air
MMA,not_removed,but dont u think that comes down to poor marketing look at what the film warrior did shit looked legit surely if there were some type of round fight tourney with rda mcg diaz bros etc everyone would watch obviously weight classes permitting and im not saying round limit just giving an example this is what i mean by recognizing new talent or dudes or chicks come in crackin skulls wiping the floor with everyone else everyones like oh shittt put dude up against dude they are both bamf gonna be a crazy fight its a sound strategy and wouldnt require a lot of out of pocket
MMA,not_removed,hold the fuck up a minute im a mma fan and i love tournaments rizin is showing exactly why tournaments still work and how to do them properly
MMA,not_removed,but dont u think that comes down to poor marketing look at what the film warrior did shit looked legit surely if there were some type of round fight tourney with rda mcg diaz bros etc everyone would watch obviously weight classes permitting and im not saying round limit just giving an example this is what i mean by recognizing new talent or dudes or chicks come in crackin skulls wiping the floor with everyone else everyones like oh shittt put dude up against dude they are both bamf gonna be a crazy fight its a sound strategy and wouldnt require a lot of out of pocket
MMA,not_removed,as with all fights that are certain to be short rounds
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor by flying gogoplata you heard it here first
MMA,not_removed,conor wins by submission in round after wrestlefucking eddie for mins
MMA,not_removed,if i had to make a prediction id go conor by ko in round could go both ways though its possible that alvarez tries to grind conor out like he did pettis but i think conor is a lot more aggressive than pettis and he wont be as timid when they separate he also has better hands than pettis and he can throw them without worrying as much about a takedownclinch as pettis did when he threw his kicks
MMA,not_removed,every time i think a fight will end quickly brock v hunt mcgregor v diaz lineker v dodson it ends up going on for five rounds so fuck it mcgregor or alvarez by dec
MMA,not_removed,alvarez by round gnp tko towards the end of the round
MMA,not_removed,i feel it will either be a counter ko by conor in the first two rounds or a long war all depends if alvarez can get him to the mat but its mma so draw by comet strike is also equally possible
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor tko round
MMA,not_removed,anything can happen in mma imagine alvarez knocking conor out in the first seconds everyone would go bonkers following a shit storm on social media
MMA,not_removed,gonna make a crazy prediction and say it will be a carbon copy of the emil meek rousimar palhares fight
MMA,not_removed,holy shit look how wild eddie was swinging there
MMA,not_removed,i think eddie gets caught with a knee trying to come in for a takedown dunno which rd tho eddie could complete a td and grind him out for close to a round or something i feel you guys are really hyping alvarez td offense a lot sure better than diaz diaz gets his subs more often when people take him down almost all of the time not much of an offensive wrestler but hes not better than mendes also if you watch mendesmcgregor and think thats his full td defense youre delusional why would he go in like that preparing for aldo whos td offense which even though we havent seen much of is equally as good or better than alvarez unless injured or retarded id say the former bc he wouldnt want to go to the ground with aldo unless conor gets caught early i think you guys are going to be shocked by mcgregors tdd or jiu jitsu if he gets taken down this is the fight where mcgregor shows his well rounded game
MMA,not_removed,rounds
MMA,not_removed,minute or longerboth guys will start strong get rocked and well have a great kickboxing contest until someone spots an opening
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor round submission
MMA,not_removed,it will be over in the first minutes alvarez always comes out swinging and conor doesnt back up unless hes gassed both guys are their most dangerous in the first few minutes someone is getting caught early
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor by heard it here first
MMA,not_removed,im not exactly pushing the boat out with my prediction either mcgregor tko round or alvarez tko round
MMA,not_removed,either the first or it goes all five no late stoppages
MMA,not_removed,its gonna be a round war imo
MMA,not_removed,carbon copy of sonnensilva mcg by triangle deep in the
MMA,not_removed,honestly i got mcg first round tkoko mcgregor unleashes storms eddie has been rocked a few times but he recovers well eddie has great power and speed in his hands but his defense is garbage especially when hes trying to finish i can see mcg catching him in a flurry and following up the biggest factor will be mcgs tdd because if mcg does rock eddie shoots if mcg can stuff that and quickly break the fence grappling he can follow up the last seconds of the mendes fight show the various type of strikes mcg can put into a combo just my pick please share your disagreements
MMA,not_removed,conor will slump him within the first two rounds or alvarez will grind to a decision
MMA,not_removed,if alvarez cant get him to the ground i think mcgregor will box him up from the outside for two rounds and tko him
MMA,not_removed,conor will punch him and eddies head will explode like celebrity death match conor by exploding head ko in round one
MMA,not_removed,alvarez looks much bigger than mcg but maybe mcg is bigger now since he bulked to welterweight for diaz
MMA,not_removed,eddie can possibly wrestle conorbut people forget eddies face was broken by a couple clean shots from gilbert
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor will ko alvarez with one of those spinning wheel kicks that always seem to barely miss this will occur with remaining in rd his first words to joe rogan after the victory will be something along the lines of the king has taken his throne joe rogan will smile but will not laugh at this comment
MMA,not_removed,conor mcgregor round submission
MMA,not_removed,round sub alvarez
MMA,not_removed,i seriously cant wait i have no idea how the fight will turn out and im so stoked to see whats gonna happen plz mma gods we are almost here we have had plenty deaths in mma to please you let this card be untouched
MMA,not_removed,about as long as me sexually
MMA,not_removed,if eddies gonna throw like that conor by tko rd
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor will dust alvarez inside one minute
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor wins alvarez wins mcgregor kos alvarez in
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor by ko round
MMA,not_removed,round tko by mcgregor at latest
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor is going to finish it in under rounds
MMA,not_removed,i think this sub is mad underestimating conor but will be a great fight and card regardless
MMA,not_removed,i still dont get how people are even comparing alvarezs wrestling to mendes they are on two different planets when it comes to wrestling alvarez is a decent wrestler dont get me wrong but mendes is considered to be one of the best wrestlers in the ufc just because mendes was able to take conor down and control him does not mean alvarez will
MMA,not_removed,imho i think mcgregor dusts him in the first round in a similar way he did to poirier eddie has heart but hes very chinny and gets wild with his looping hooks while having his chin in the air i am a mcgregor fan yes but i also love eddie hes had so many wars and good fights over the years but i dont think he wins unless he laynprays
MMA,not_removed,i feel like alverezs face is wide fucking open while hes swinging so many times in those gifs where a well times counter would ko him and where a well times counter wouldnt be too hard im half tempted to go for conor by ko
MMA,not_removed,alvarez tko round
MMA,not_removed,conor stops him in the tird round
MMA,not_removed,alvarez by decision via wrestlefuck
MMA,not_removed,alvarez via decision
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor tries his hand at panic wrestling and gets kod stiff
MMA,not_removed,aw man i just thought that rda would be the immortal champion he was heavy on eddie before he caught the shot and just caved in to the pressure
MMA,not_removed,eddie will tko him after a clinch battle in the end of round
MMA,not_removed,seconds
MMA,not_removed,someone will get ktfo by trying to impress the crowd with spinning shit
MMA,not_removed,mcgregors going to send him back to bumtown
MMA,not_removed,i see it ending two ways either conor kos eddie or eddie manhandles conor into submission
MMA,not_removed,precision beats power and timing beats speed said mcgregor which is why alvarez can not and will not stand and box him and will win via decision after taking the fight to the ground after the round if and i mean if he survives conors left hand
MMA,not_removed,but if mcgregor cant ko people like he did at featherweight i do not see him lasting long amongst especial with khabib his likely next opponent not to mention rda and ferguson also another food for thought looking at alvarez vs pettis how close that was if pettis was hitting with mcgregor power the decision would easily of been his there are a lot of other factors to this but mcgregor by decision is not out of the realm of possibility
MMA,not_removed,we all know mcgregor is stubborn and overconfident hell do the same thing he did in the first diaz fight and unload in the first round until he gasses you can already tell from his interviews that he is underestimating eddies striking
MMA,not_removed,alvarez shoots early and finishes the fight in the round i just dont see how conor will defend from any of alvarezs take down attempts
MMA,not_removed,alvarez by ko inside minutes
MMA,not_removed,seconds
MMA,not_removed,alvarez tko mid way through the third
MMA,not_removed,if conor wins it ends on the first round if alvarez wins it will have rounds
MMA,not_removed,alvarez by dec
MMA,not_removed,everyone talks about nates chin eddies only been tkod once in to the giant nick thompson conor couldnt put nate away so think hes in for a long night and maybe eddie will put on a wrestling show with takedown after takedown then ground and pound a decision
MMA,not_removed,if alvarez pulls a daniel cormier and wrestle fucks mcgregor he should be ashamed to put that belt in and call himself a fighter if you cant stand up with the best and duke it out you dont deserve to be there fighting like cormier is the cheapest form of victory and is certainly not considered fighting
MMA,not_removed,dont know how long it will last but mcgregor will definitely win and youll all be salty as fuck d xxx if you think that flaling bullshit is gonna get you anywhere in there with conor youve got another thought coming when mcgregor called it sloppy my god he was not joking
MMA,not_removed,depends on how many lunches conor packs
MMA,not_removed,herb dean fucking sucks im gonna keep saying this until it catches on hes so fucking bad rda isnt doing any damage whatsoever there and because he looks up at him he gives in to the pressure and stops it
MMA,not_removed,philly style
MMA,not_removed,man fuck that cerrone fight
MMA,not_removed,until it is over duh
MMA,not_removed,its gonna be a draw
MMA,not_removed,alvarez gonna make conor his play toy expect a brutal unrelenting beating up against the cage and gnpd til ref calls it
MMA,not_removed,this sub is flooded with mcgregor fanboys whose first ufc was youre boy is about to get exposed its going to be a rough night for mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,this is mma if you think you know when a fight will end sit the fuck down son
MMA,not_removed,i shouldnt need two hands to count the number of times ive heard something like dont blink and were entering the championship rounds used during the same fight
MMA,not_removed,i think the longer the fight goes on the more likely alvarez is gonna win by ass whooping
MMA,not_removed,i really doubt it this time i think one of them is getting stopped just not sure which one
MMA,not_removed,this but just a fraction of seconds before the end of the fight after mcgregor just wrestlefucks alvarez for rounds Ã  la khabib suplex city in this hoe
MMA,not_removed,i think you mean you herd it hear first
MMA,not_removed,alvarez by swanton bomb he will literally be broken in half
MMA,not_removed,agreed his science training will have dramatically increased his wrestlefuck ability
MMA,not_removed,nice
MMA,not_removed,wut
MMA,not_removed,as ridiculous as this is going to sound for some unfounded reason i feel like i can guarandamfuckingtee that conor will break a hand which will lead to him losing a long and quite underwhelming fight where alvarez is soundly beating him in every aspect of the fight but just cant seem to put him away by the time conor is done acknowledging the injury to joe rogan in the postfight interview the internet will already have made wholehands mcgregor an mmameme and for some reason this is bugging me
MMA,not_removed,pettis actually has extremely good takedown defense his problems is that he backs straight up into the fence conor has better lateral movement but i think his takedown defense isnt as good as that of pettis
MMA,not_removed,that would be an impressive feat by conor eddies only been stopped by punches once and it was a very long time ago hes only lost in the first once to aoki quite a while ago as well
MMA,not_removed,bisping vs hendo
MMA,not_removed,i could see this the way mendes handled him on the ground i could see alvarez pulling this off but conor had time to prepare for this fight unlike the mendes fight so his td should probably be better but then again alvarez had time to hone his takedowns as well very interesting fight for sure
MMA,not_removed,or a gnp tko from alvarez
MMA,not_removed,honestly i really dont like how alvarez drops his hands as he resets eddie has been rocked before off counters and conor has a lot of power in the first two rounds id agree and say conor within the first two
MMA,not_removed,yeah i have seen people saying that eddie will just implement a similar gameplan to the one he beat pettis with when has pettis put someone out with one punch that pressure is going to be a key point that alvarez will want to push but the only similarity between mcgregor and pettis that i see is that theyre both dudes
MMA,not_removed,cant be swinging from the hips with conor when he has a laserbeam left straight
MMA,not_removed,alvarez is a good boxer but he throws caution to the wind pretty often he goes into brawl mode not unlike lawler i expect to see him get his chin tested in this fight but i also expect the same for conor
MMA,not_removed,sort of the gif doesnt start until after he already dropped him twice so youre seeing him empty the last little bit of his gas tank into a guy whos barely conscious
MMA,not_removed,to be fair at that point in the fight he had already hurt rda bad and was looking for the finishing blow judging his form when he is going for a kill against a hurt opponent is not fair on the other hand rda was dominating the stand up before getting rocked
MMA,not_removed,could leave himself open to a counter left for sure
MMA,not_removed,hes going to get kod with a counter if he attempts that shit with conor tbh
MMA,not_removed,im a huge diaz bros fan so i normally hate on conor in an unnecessary way but conors got underrated jitz and working with dillon who is a legit jiu jitsu phenom isnt going to hurt him lol i kinda hope to see jiu jitsu conor on the
MMA,not_removed,the last two lines this we havent seen much of conors tdd and ground game since mendes theres so much we havent seen that clearly he has improved on that i think alvarez will have a hard time when trying to wrestlefuck conor look conor can get caught anyone can get caught this fight is only going to alvarez if he catches conor with a lucky strike that stuns him if he does not eventually i think its going to play in conors hands
MMA,not_removed,he was preparing for rda before diaz and nate took him down with almost no effort he had a much better showing in the second fight though so well see eddie mixes up his wrestling and striking much better than chad or nate in my opinion
MMA,not_removed,i think youre overrating eddies striking and underestimating conors striking and counters if eddie wants to win he needs to do the exact opposite of having a great kickboxing contest because if he doesnt mystic mac will have struck again with his prediction of a ko in the round
MMA,not_removed,i like the idea of conor winning by submission just because its the last thing most of us expect imagine he drills nothing but standing guillotines in expectation that eddie will indeed shoot for his life
MMA,not_removed,so the fights never gunna happen
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor kos alvarez in round or alvarez scores enough points to get the decision but the way conor looked against nate i wouldnt be too surprised if he beat alvarez by decision if he can defend the takedown and hack at alvarez legs he could land some hard shots and maybe get a late finish or a decision
MMA,not_removed,chad is the better wrestler but i think alvarez is more fluid with his transitions between striking and takedowns frankie edgar isnt the most amazing wrestler ever but he takes a lot of people down because of how smooth and fast he transitions from striking to wrestling
MMA,not_removed,disagree alvarez will have a better time wrestling mcgregor than did mendes hes bigger and has had success wrestling in lightweight mendes could not wrestle mcgregor effectively in part because of the difference in strength and size
MMA,not_removed,yeah but rda was barely conscious this gif is eddie going for the finish after he knows its over the rest of the fight up to the point where eddie first wobbles him both fighters were pretty conservative
MMA,not_removed,i like this prediction and i think eddie is being overlooked people see him grinding it out to decision but i would not be surpised if eddie would tko him in a clinch battle
MMA,not_removed,conors fight iq and ability to be cerebral in there is also one of his strengths tho i think eddie has a high fight iq as well but hes quite a wild man in there particularly with his striking conor picks his shots and uses his movement a lot more i wouldnt put so much stock in alvarez announcing hes training to counter one of conors strengths thats what fight camps are for doesnt mean hell be able to execute it conor will be doing the same thing
MMA,not_removed,knowing about something doesnt always mean you can defend it any better look at diaz who is known for his boxing mcgregor kept clipping him with that left hand of his in rematch despite having seen it before when a guy is throwing a bunch of different stuff at you and moving around he can catch you sure conor relies on that left of his but he sets it up
MMA,not_removed,if it lasts longer than a round i truly believe mcgregor will be humiliated what everyone said about diazmcgregor
MMA,not_removed,people are getting way too caught up on this rockback thing yes mcgregor uses it a lot to land the counter left muhammad ali did something similar to land his famous anchor punch it not even really something he does defensively its about countering the idea that alvarez will easily be able to make him unable to use that technique and that his game will fall apart as a result is really really stupid
MMA,not_removed,to be fair we dont actually know how likely it is that conor will gas we basically have no idea what his cardio is like at
MMA,not_removed,its a hell of a lot harder for a guy with shorter height and reach like alverez to combat a rock back technique hell need to pressure conor hard to stop him from countering his jab and doing that to a guy like conor who can fight backwards powerfully is a tall order eddie is going to have to weather a serious storm before he can get comfortable up in mcgregors face
MMA,not_removed,also rumour of a retirement after this fight so he may only be fighting alvarez at lw
MMA,not_removed,ð
MMA,not_removed,it appears you dont know how stoppages work if a fighter is in trouble they get a warning about defending themselves if the fighter then just turtles up turns away from the shots or isnt trying to actively defend themselves in an effective way then theyll stop the fight watch this its great and big john lays it all out clearly
MMA,not_removed,this sub is flooded with guys who think they know whats gonna happen in a fight
MMA,not_removed,you say mcgregor is about to get exposed but people said the same thing about him against aldo what the fuck are you talking about motherfucker
MMA,not_removed,i remember telling everyone not to blink during the rumble teixeira fight andddd i missed it
MMA,not_removed,also this gonna be a fucking war and its all over in the same round
MMA,not_removed,conor by knockout or eddie by wrestlefuck
MMA,not_removed,agreed
MMA,not_removed,im not a mcgregor fan but i think hes a lot more precise than alvarez is so if alvarez tries to stand with him hes going to go down
MMA,not_removed,i approve of this
MMA,not_removed,i agree mcgregor will just wrestlefuck him the whole fight decision for mcgregor joey diaz challenges mcgregor to a hell in a cell match after
MMA,not_removed,you cant possibly find it boring seeing someone pull off a suplex
MMA,not_removed,brother conor will be deleted
MMA,not_removed,exactly and eddie and henry know this obviously which is why eddie keeps saying he is going to keep it standing hes afraid of the wrestle fuck
MMA,not_removed,if this happens im blaming you for putting the idea out into the universe
MMA,not_removed,idk about not putting him away diaz almost got him with a simple mcgregor doesnt have a very strong chin
MMA,not_removed,i agree
MMA,not_removed,alvarez is incredibly strong and stocky i doubt mcgregor will be able to just lift him off like he did with mendes hes gonna need to sweep him or just defend the takedown with his life
MMA,not_removed,handled him he got up after of quite quickly after of them and the majority of the damage he took came after the raking of a cut
MMA,not_removed,most likely option imo
MMA,not_removed,really dont know how mcgregor is on the mat yet with regards to the octagon against serious competition even with holloway both men where relatively inexperienced at the time both have developed since then this fight i feel could go either way honestly couldnt predict it
MMA,not_removed,conor has also been rocked before by a guy who hadnt won by stoppage win in years
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats pretty ridiculous eddies better wrestler than palhares and conor cant generate as much power as a roided up welterweight he said gonna make a crazy prediction
MMA,not_removed,hence crazy
MMA,not_removed,and reach advantage over eddie
MMA,not_removed,if he has conor as fucked up as rda was in that gif he can do whatever he wants rda is a much more dangerous opponent just before the start of this gif alvarez drops him at least without any wild swings
MMA,not_removed,exactly conor has better jiujitsu than eddie and eddie is nowhere near what rmma is making him out to be as a wrestler people are saying hell have more success than mendes who was a ncaa champ ffsi mean say what you want to hype yourself uphate on mcgregor but the diazrda fights were way worse matchups for him than eddie
MMA,not_removed,i dont really like saying this but i dont feel this is a close match up at all i think mcgregor should win easily enough but am hesitant to outright say it based on lawlerwoodley and rdaalvarez which i thought the winners would be obvious then turned out not to be to be fair i am a mcgregor nut hugger but im not a casual or completely delusional like most on this sub would have you believe about all of us at least i dont think i just really havent been impressed as of late with alvarez game hes well rounded had a good early career and everything but thats about it i will say that mark henry could really be what he needs at this point but cant be too sure as we only saw like minutes vs rda which i believe was his first and only fight where he trained under him
MMA,not_removed,connor shot when he was gassed it wasnt really a take down nate put his weight on him and sent him down
MMA,not_removed,i think eddies got better cardio after getting rocked and i think theyll both get rocked early i expect them both to come out swinging connor got beat up by nate pretty good in the loss and the win and rda went through nate like a hot knife through butter then got starched by eddie so my mma math skills say that eddie has the advantage going into this one
MMA,not_removed,that would be hilarious as fuck if conor won by guillotine
MMA,not_removed,i could definitely see eddie getting rocked and then shooting for a lazy takedown and getting caught in a guillotine but i feel like theres no way eddie would get caught in something like that unless he just got his brain bounced around a bit
MMA,not_removed,i honestly think we might see a submission from mcgregor maybe not this fight but one in the future
MMA,not_removed,but eddie doesnt take a lot of people down
MMA,not_removed,sorry man but you have no idea what you are talking about the diaz brothers never implement any kind of game plan not to mention they dont have a real head coach alvarez will listen to mark henrys game plan and execute it
MMA,not_removed,probably not much better than it was six weeks ago or however recently the diaz fight was i think he has a lot more going for him than his pull counter though
MMA,not_removed,what evidence do you have of conors cardio all his fights have ended early with the exception of the diaz fight the holloway fight was only rounds
MMA,not_removed,it is possible
MMA,not_removed,then just turtles up turns away from the shots or isnt trying to actively defend themselves in an effective way then theyll stop the fight i wouldnt call that turtling sure hes turned degrees from the shots does that count as away hes defending himself he literally stopped every one of those punches with his hand
MMA,not_removed,this sub is flooded with guys who think they know whats gonna happen in a fight nobody fucking knows really and it doesnt matter how much you know about martial arts look at dominick cruz first mcgregordiaz fight he predicted mcgregor would win in the rematch he gave it to diaz he was wrong twice here we have a ufc champion predicting it wrong
MMA,not_removed,i correctly predicted mcgregor would be fw champ after his ufc debut i was mcgregors biggest fan before all the fuckery after he beat jose mcgregor has been handed matchups that play into his strengths save this comment eddie is going to put the beating on mcgregor that frankie would have if mcgregor would have manned up and defended his belt
MMA,not_removed,aldo got caught anyone can get caught aldo beat himself mentally before he stepped into the cage aldo would win against mcgregor if he was in the right mindset
MMA,not_removed,same thing happened to me during osps most recent fight i hyped him up to some of my friends how he was talented and aside from the jones loss he was a solid fighter then he gets fucking rocked at and tries to get up only to be smited back to the ground for a quick power nap
MMA,not_removed,when conor knocked out jose one of my friends was getting up to turn his chair around towards the screen towards the beginning of the fight and another buddy yelled ohhhh at about the second mark and made my friend turn around quickly then seconds later came the real ohhhh and he didnt even turn around missed it lol
MMA,not_removed,i was telling all of my friends that came over that rumble was the scariest fighter inside the octagon for the first seconds of a fight he definitely lived up to it in that fight
MMA,not_removed,i kinda want the wrestlefuck so the conor fanboys have a melt down
MMA,not_removed,way to go out on a limb on that prediction
MMA,not_removed,yes leaning towards conor but i gave alvarez no chance against rda so who knows
MMA,not_removed,i am sure that alvarez has no intention to stand and bang in front of conor he has always said that conor has a hole in his gameplan wrestling and wonders why people dont use it you can see that he always has a different approach in every fight he went into the pettis melendez and rda fights with completely different gameplans i have no idea how this fight is goint to end but there is no way eddie is going to try to stand with him
MMA,not_removed,more precise in what sense eddies precision is what landed him the money shot that hurt rda in the first place to act like eddie was just swinging from the fences the moment the bell went is just being disingenuous
MMA,not_removed,i feel like eddie has all the tools to beat him but hes going to decide to stand and try to trade with him i just think hes going to give it away
MMA,not_removed,im comin for you cocksuckah youre takin everything i stole for
MMA,not_removed,i never said i did i fucking love seeing a fighter pull off a suplex except when it was rory bringing nate to suplex city that shit broke my heart hahaha
MMA,not_removed,well now were just being ridiculous
MMA,not_removed,brother anthony
MMA,not_removed,delete delete delete delete
MMA,not_removed,now its bound to happenthats how these things work right
MMA,not_removed,mendes is a amazing athlete though and a far more accomplished wrestler than eddie conor is also noticeably larger than he is at right now and his leg is in much better shape
MMA,not_removed,of yeah thats not good for a fight less than rounds alvarez is a bigger stronger opponent conor cant allow that many tds
MMA,not_removed,who was that nate won by tko in november
MMA,not_removed,making me think we might see the left straight in the max holloway fight that froze max
MMA,not_removed,yeah i personally dont expect eddie to have a similar game plan to mendes i think we will see a lot of clinch work tho
MMA,not_removed,he got taken down in the first round by a really half hearted single leg
MMA,not_removed,no one can take this left elbow part on the inside because im not a doctor and i dont know what its called
MMA,not_removed,well he did get one in cage warriors so definitely not out of the question
MMA,not_removed,he got a single leg on rda
MMA,not_removed,yes because he likes to brawl and trade but he has done it before he took rda down in his last fight
MMA,not_removed,just like frankie did against aldo came in with a less effective strategy the time
MMA,not_removed,all he did was point out one of the many vocal opinions of this subreddit premcgregors last fight the idea that that makes him not know what hes talking about is laughable you just put words together in a negative response
MMA,not_removed,i mean its almost certainly going to be better than it was at since this fight is at and that one was at that makes quite a lot of difference to your cardio
MMA,not_removed,that was at which definitely makes a difference according to cowboy
MMA,not_removed,well we have the evidence that he won a round fight with nate diaz
MMA,not_removed,i didnt say there was any evidence for him having good cardio either but its stupid to write off his cardio at just because it wasnt incredible at
MMA,not_removed,did you watch the video i linked in my comment big john literally says something like dont just put your hand up like this and turn your head away i know he points to john kavanagh didnt teach you that
MMA,not_removed,but what about his match up with mendes and diaz isnt to his strength if so then they wouldnt hand him a second fight after losing the first
MMA,not_removed,im not a mcgregor fan but aldo mendes and diaz were not fighters that played to his strengths he was also set to fight rda dont forget
MMA,not_removed,are you like a prophet then
MMA,not_removed,aldo got caught anyone can get caught aldo beat himself mentally before he stepped into the cage aldo would win against mcgregor if he was in the right mindset i also believe in the skills of aldo in a rematch he very well could win against conor which is why i believe the ufc are not so keen on having a rematch
MMA,not_removed,dude i was hyping up barnett and catch wrestling with some casuals when he was going to fight rothwell cut to rothwell choking barnett out im sitting there just lamenting thats the cool part about mma anything can happen
MMA,not_removed,everyone within earshot at bww thought i was a genius all i did was get a buzz and yellanthony johnson is the scariest man on the planet for seconds a dozen or so times before the fight
MMA,not_removed,i want it because it would force conor to go back down for a rematch with aldo
MMA,not_removed,while it would be nice to see the butthurt i kinda wanna see just how big the mcgregor hype can get hes good for mma and the bigger he gets the bigger the sport gets having guys like conor take home massive paydays is how we steal the best athletes who normally would go to football soccer baseball and basketball
MMA,not_removed,if conor gets wrestlefucked for five rounds then the fanboys arent gonna have a melt down itll only strengthen their belief that conor is the greatest striker on the planet and that alvarez was too scared to stand and bang with him
MMA,not_removed,what can i say im a maverick
MMA,not_removed,im in the same boat i gave alvarez no chance against rda but id still pick rda in that fight times outta i see conor winning this via or round ko
MMA,not_removed,i doubt he will wrestle fuck straight away imo hes going to stand and see how that goes during the ariel walk he said he wrote himself a letter after the pettis fight he didnt like how he fought and wont fight like that again
MMA,not_removed,to be fair eddie throws fairly wildly and is very open in exchanges they have a very different style of standup
MMA,not_removed,just watch the final sequence of rda vs eddie he connets with maybe shots
MMA,not_removed,he swings a bit wildly in all his fights from what ive seen
MMA,not_removed,conor is more precise in every sense eddies good in the pocket and that is about it ive recently watched ever single one of his ufc fights and striking wise he is not great the only really impressive combo he threw is the one that stunned rda if you wanna see how eddie does against a striker with better range look at him v cerrone cerrone fucked him up he needs to wrestle if he fights like he did against pettis he will win
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor better pack eight lunches mother fucker
MMA,not_removed,what about your ac
MMA,not_removed,a far more accomplished wrestler at lbs on a two week training camp
MMA,not_removed,yea i forgot the maynard fight tko in years then
MMA,not_removed,the fights were mcgregor just picks their opponent apart are a beauty to watch hope we see that mcgregor again but with the rise of talent hes fighting i doubt it
MMA,not_removed,i think a mendes game plan is the only shot he has other than a lucky ko i dont think he has any tools to instigate a clinch hes short slow and powerful mcgregor will move around him if he just stands if he shoots he might get the takedown and hold him there or he might not but thats his only shot
MMA,not_removed,what a moronic argument frankie obviously wanted to take aldo down and aldo had anticipated this which is why he didnt throw leg kicks aldo has insane take down defense are you seriously going to tell me that conor has the same takedown defense as aldo where was his takedown defense against mendes or at the end of the last diaz fight which he ended on his back
MMA,not_removed,yes but his cardio was average at with pretty much no improvement from and he doesnt have enough time to make any substantial improvements itll probably be better than it was at but its unlikely to be substantially different
MMA,not_removed,thanks for your expertise
MMA,not_removed,yeah but that doesnt count for some reason
MMA,not_removed,and evidence of him gassing in the second when nate whooped his ass and made him call him daddy
MMA,not_removed,he showed that he gassed during that fight and he barely won that fight many people said it was a draw again i go back to my original point the diaz bros refuse to implement any gameplan
MMA,not_removed,he won rd against cardio god nate diaz how is that not incredible
MMA,not_removed,mendes handled conor pretty easily on the ground until he gassed as he came in on a couple weeks notice
MMA,not_removed,im just another asshole talking shit on the internet mcgregor could catch eddie for sure just my two cents
MMA,not_removed,i need some time in between that i want to see mcgregor fight a couple of other folks beforehand
MMA,not_removed,while i agree to an extent its fucking annoying how cm fans think everyone else is a joke theres no respect for anyone else with the exception of cody garbrant lol
MMA,not_removed,whats sad its probably what will happen
MMA,not_removed,semi lol
MMA,not_removed,rda put amazing pressure on alvarez and was winning that fight until suddenly he wasnt my main takeaway from that fight remains rdas chin is otherworldly if herb hadnt stopped the fight i think rda would have absorbed punches for the rest of the round and come out for round two and eddie may well have punched himself out
MMA,not_removed,are you sure i heard that interview or another interview with him and ariel and eddie said that pettis simply did not bring the fight in him wrestling him to a decision was too easy of an option not to do it he then said that rda would bring the fight in him which was right on point i did not understand it like he had regrets of fighting like that and even if he would say that i am sure he would just say it for the fans i think he will not care about what people will think of him if it will result in a loss against conor there is way too much at stake he is smart with a great fight iq
MMA,not_removed,when he had rda badly hurt thats exactly what im saying eddie was very precise with his strikes and counters leading up to that moments a great deal of ufc strikers tends to go wild at the sight of blood acting like eddie was wild with his punches right out the gate is just not true his accuracy is what landed him that money shot in the first place
MMA,not_removed,precision is no longer important to eddie at that moment in the fight hes throwing huge power shot after huge power shot trying to stop rda and give him no room to recover if you rewatch the fight youll see that even though rda was pushing the pace and pressing forward eddie would land a retaliatory shot in nearly every one of their exchanges and they were all precise
MMA,not_removed,it looks like he is fighting off a swarm of bees
MMA,not_removed,conor is more precise in every sense i never meant in what sense relative to eddies stirking vs conors conor is definitely a better striker even though firas zahabi was trying to argue otherwise i meant what about eddies striking isnt precise using examples when he has a man badly hurt and isnt worrying about any counters is a poor example
MMA,not_removed,conor is more precise in every sense are his takedowns more precise than eddies
MMA,not_removed,you really arent giving eddie enough credit for his outfighting and footwork though he likes to open up and get wild in exchanges hes usually circling the octagon more often than not
MMA,not_removed,nah the ac is fine
MMA,not_removed,on steroids
MMA,not_removed,you do know that they both weighed in at right also one of them has been popped for peds since then but what do i know
MMA,not_removed,conor was also a fighter at the time fought chad on short notice as well you also forgetting that chad kept saying he was in shape before the fight in case either of them pulled out id say your more salty about the beating conor gave nate in august
MMA,not_removed,i think its worth remembering though that nate is the nightmare match up for mcgregor mcs style relies on superior boxing skill reach
MMA,not_removed,it definitely looked better at than at but that was probably mostly down to his gameplan as he gassed hard and looked out of his depth he did gas towards the end of round and through but he powered through and got his second wind of course theres no real way of knowing what his gas tank will be like at but im sure it will be better when he weighs less
MMA,not_removed,cuz he didnt win
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah the round where diaz fell twice to lure conor into jumping into his guard
MMA,not_removed,diaz played touchbutt with the canvas twice in that second round
MMA,not_removed,no if he had of gassed he wouldve lost the fight he was tired adjusted and won and he did that against a much larger opponent carrying much more weight on himself
MMA,not_removed,his recovery was certainly incredible but he did gas pretty hard at the end of the second
MMA,not_removed,yes he did just proving my point that he didnt get handed favorable matchups
MMA,not_removed,fair enough haha
MMA,not_removed,chill fam mcgregor is gonna wrap one on one shoulder and wrap the udder on the udder shoulder and youre gonna need a fuckin army to get the belts off him
MMA,not_removed,who if he wants to keep calling himself a champion he has to eventually defend his belt and aldo is the fight to make
MMA,not_removed,he wasnt successful the round hence the semi
MMA,not_removed,and to think jeremy who the fook is that guy stephens knocked out rda is a gif of the uppercut
MMA,not_removed,its the very recent one where theyre walking through eddies home town he literally says he had to write himself a letter after that fight ill try and find the link and post it
MMA,not_removed,oh right i see what you mean i mean hes not the most precise striker though hes mainly good when he gets in tight he throws overhands all the time and they barely land
MMA,not_removed,i meant in terms of striking haha
MMA,not_removed,thats good
MMA,not_removed,what do you think eddie was doing in bellator eddie probably still has that trt strength its semipermanent as long as you cycle correctly and wean off of it properly some of the physical benefits stick with you see hendo keeping his hbomb even after stopping trt
MMA,not_removed,youve completely missed my point im highlighting that conor beating mendes means nothing because eddie alvarez is a fully fledged lw not a fw
MMA,not_removed,fought chad on short notice as well false equivalence conor had a full training camp not exclusively for mendes but he still had a full camp id say your more salty about the beating conor gave nate in august i predicted nate losing the second time nate simply isnt that great of lw hes a journeyman and i dont have him being competitive with any of the top at lw also even if i was a nate fanboy why would i be salty conor and diaz are with diaz having the significantly more decisive win
MMA,not_removed,i dont see how nate is a nightmare match up hes primarily a boxer with terrible takedowns why is that seen as a bad matchup for conor a bad matchup for conor is a grappler like eddie khabib or rda not another striker
MMA,not_removed,he gassed at basically the same point at but yeah he came back so who knows
MMA,not_removed,did you miss the first fight
MMA,not_removed,a lot of fighters gas and still win a fight mcgregor definitely gassed
MMA,not_removed,gas or not id say thats definitely evidence of his cardio
MMA,not_removed,its the fight nobody who started watching mma within the last year wants to see because they dont realize how dangerous aldo is due to him being knocked out by mcg relatively it wasnt that long ago aldo was considered the best imo the newbies dont understand how frail conors dominance in the sport is if he lost to alvarez and aldo afterward he would start to fade out of the limelight and those are very real possibilities people just dont want to accept
MMA,not_removed,thats because stephens is the hardest hitting pounder fool
MMA,not_removed,he also permanently disfigured his leg on nate diazs head as well didnt he jeremy really had a chance to fire back on that one didnt he
MMA,not_removed,thats before rda morphed his face using trt and steroids
MMA,not_removed,heres my crack at this alvarez will take a page out of mendes and impose his superior wrestling and ground pound that way i think hell gas him out make conor more hesitant to throw because of the threat of a takedown from there eddies best shot is to finish him off in a similar fashion with rda if he doesnt conor will definitely put him away idk though anything can happen
MMA,not_removed,ok i was talking about a different interview right after the fight however no matter what he said about that fight i am sure that he does not give a st about the fans if the title against conor is at stake
MMA,not_removed,i dont know unless he lets himself get into a brawl he can be very accurate the rda fight is the best evidence of this he was landing sharp counters and kept very composed throughout all of the exchanges
MMA,not_removed,i know i was just taking the piss p
MMA,not_removed,it is actually permanent according to science results not the whole thing but many benefits from
MMA,not_removed,and conor will be a full fledged lw instead of a fw
MMA,not_removed,just realized how badly i want to see diaz fight ferguson i feel like thatd be a good scrap due to styles
MMA,not_removed,hes not like the nightmare matchup id say khabib is for sure but i think hes a really bad matchup because conor relies on fast knockouts using his reach and superior ability to pick shots to be able to cut off octagon space and fire the left nate can take a punch like no other has longer reach and has better boxing so literally everything mcgregor is good at is nullified also nate didnt give a fuck about the trash talking which is a big part of mcgregors game
MMA,not_removed,nate has a longer reach is taller has elite bjj elite boxing by mma standards freakish cardio and an inhuman chin conor has clear advantages over everybody you mentioned reach striking and ko power but he has no clear advantage over nate on paper nate is absolutely a nightmare match up for conor
MMA,not_removed,he very well could be who really knows
MMA,not_removed,josh thompson is the one who dented his leg on diaz not stephens
MMA,not_removed,heres the link to the video its linked to the time
MMA,not_removed,but that wasnt the argument at all were discussing mendes no need to move the goalposts now
MMA,not_removed,holy fuck yea that would be legit diazferguson and rdabarboza those two fights are killer fights in the division imo
MMA,not_removed,nate definitely doesnt have better boxing than conor
MMA,not_removed,and yet he still was the ranked lw at the time of beating conor its absolutely hilarious how nate has went from an arguable gatekeeperjourneyman at lw to this fucking unbeatable monster all because he beat a featherweight
MMA,not_removed,fucking damnit i always get those two mixed up
MMA,not_removed,i was discussing your point about weight conor fought a fw wrestler while weighing in at he will be fighting a lw wrestler while hopefully weighing in at the goal posts are exactly where theyve been the entire time youve just been distracted by the hot dog vendor
MMA,not_removed,he really does nate and nick probably have the best boxing in the ufc like im a big conor fan but the only reason he won that second fight was because he adapted and was smarter than diaz if they were to both stand and trade he would loose every time
MMA,not_removed,nobody is saying hes unbeatable just that he nullifies conors advantages better than anybody else in the division he may only be ranked at number but he has a longer reach better cardio and arguably a better chin than anybody ranked ahead of him nate has always been susceptible to being grapple fucked but he has always been a nightmarish match up to anybody with a quick finish style hence why hes a terrible match up for conor
MMA,not_removed,i was discussing your point about weight well i and the person i was discussing this topic with werent so your point relative to the discussion i was in is completely irrelevant we were discussing mendes and eddie alvarez
MMA,not_removed,it looks like those elbows landed right behind the ear which is legal
MMA,not_removed,they werent to the back of the head
MMA,not_removed,this thread demonstrates exactly why this rule is dumb you can always just say to and its a legal elbow
MMA,not_removed,they hit the ear
MMA,not_removed,keep in mind the illegal area is basically where a thick mohawk would cover is a video with john mccarthy describing the prohibited area
MMA,not_removed,ok well no wonder ive been confused about these rules they seem pretty fucking vague thanks for the explanations
MMA,not_removed,has to be directly the back of the head the ref may have considered those strikes more off to the side
MMA,not_removed,thanks for the replies what about the rule werent those elbows coming straight down
MMA,not_removed,its still a clear to elbow though what are the rules on that in regards to where you hit someone jones lost because of them
MMA,not_removed,yeah if the reason of the rule is that the point of elbow to head is too dangerous i doubt a couple of degrees difference in the angle of the blow somehow negates the damage
MMA,not_removed,watching that video should be mandatory for everyone interested in mma big john is an amazing dude
MMA,not_removed,i asked about this on a moronic monday because of this match as well i agree that this rule is so vague
MMA,not_removed,no those had some angle to them id say they are close to the rule is very specific
MMA,not_removed,if the elbows are not coming straight down they are considered fine you can see that lauzon is looping them around like a which is fine basically never ever gets called unless youre jon jones lol but his were pretty blatant
MMA,not_removed,clear arc to those strikes
MMA,not_removed,not really the elbows start on a downward angle but turn a bit before impact in order to get called on elbows they have to be really blatant
MMA,not_removed,exactly the reason why the rule is retarded
MMA,not_removed,ok
MMA,not_removed,ive put this on streamable so that we dont give views to tmz httpsstreamablecomddneu
MMA,not_removed,its very rare that we see a fighter win both fights and i think this is because usually the losing fighter makes big adjustments while the other is satisfied with their previous performance and think it will lead to victory again in my opinion this will play very heavily into this fight dc will expect rumble to come forward and swing for the fences hoping he will gas himself again but rumble will most likely play it safe and pick his shots this time
MMA,not_removed,not always the case
MMA,not_removed,youre a good dude op
MMA,not_removed,i full expect to see the rumble we saw against davis cautious tactful and accurate
MMA,not_removed,is it very rare would like to see some statistics on rematches im not sure
MMA,not_removed,true but when it happens we get fights like lawlerhendricks or machidashogun or chandleralvarez
MMA,not_removed,tactful well at least he wont be rude
MMA,not_removed,than some infographic
MMA,not_removed,found this with a quick google search httpiimgurcomzgimmkjjpg
MMA,not_removed,i exaggerated with the very rare but you get my point it isnt often that a fighter wins both fights
MMA,not_removed,or you get fights like aldoedgar ii or johnsonbenavidez ii mma is not and never will be a onesizefitsall sport
MMA,not_removed,i hate autocorrect
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck is that thing
MMA,not_removed,who wins the fight
MMA,not_removed,the winner wins the rematch more than of the time
MMA,not_removed,that would work if it was even kind of rare its more likely that the winner of the first fight wins the rematch
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i dont think there will be one in my opinion dc becomes a permanent analyst if he loses to rumble his only motivation as of recent seems to be that jones rematch but losing to rumble will set him back
MMA,not_removed,httpimgurcomiivcubr
MMA,not_removed,nah i meant in general
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,yea the way they were talking and what dana was saying about robbie the other day cowboylawler ufc seems like a good bet
MMA,not_removed,damn thatd be awesome
MMA,not_removed,awesome fight for msg
MMA,not_removed,ill believe it when i see it
MMA,not_removed,gsp
MMA,not_removed,it would put cowboy in the already crowded hat for title shot
MMA,not_removed,can i get a time stamp of when they said it
MMA,not_removed,dayum that and the tv series godless waiting for him good for him seems kinda tense though tonight
MMA,not_removed,i would be so torn on this one two of my favorite fighters going at it it would be such a great fight
MMA,not_removed,will you or will the fight be unfuckingbelievable
MMA,not_removed,ive heard from inside sources at tristar that gsp will only return when scientists figure out how to extract dinodna from fossilised mosquitos and the nevada state athletic commision sanction a cloned velociraptor to fight inside the octagon
MMA,not_removed,gsp wont fight either one of these chumps there is only fight for him and thats mcgregor i think he would like to test himself one mroe time in the cage to see if he can make it into championship rounds with the notorious one
MMA,not_removed,in my opinion it would put cowboy in behind maia who is behind wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,roughly
MMA,not_removed,yeah we want to see cowboy continue to succeed at ww but having lawler lose in a row would be pretty bad
MMA,not_removed,how can an irishman have such bad bait
MMA,not_removed,i agree that the true test is mcgregor gsp would have two tests there can he handle a strong striker and can be handle championship rounds in all serious can you imagine gsp coming back at lightweight wins his warmup fight wins the belt then mcgregor that would be fucking awesome
MMA,not_removed,thanks
MMA,not_removed,fresh off his two fight losing streak lawler signs with bellator to rejuvenate his career
MMA,not_removed,hes handled better strikers and harder hitters than mcgregor lol if you think that fight would be remotely competitive
MMA,not_removed,does he come back at lightweight or the more comfortable ww
MMA,not_removed,unfortunately hes already had his career rejuvenation at this point hes more likely to take the condit route than the rory route
MMA,not_removed,i think gsp wins handily i would still enjoy the spectacle though apparently thats a bad thing on this forum
MMA,not_removed,im not sure hes mentioned that lightweight is an option maybe its easier for him to retain a little less muscle and cut to lightweight i think hes huge at lightweight and walks through just about anyone whos gonna out wrestle him
MMA,not_removed,i feel like robbie is the guy who will take it way too far he will chuck or wanderlei it he seems like the kind of guy who isnt going to lose his taste for combat any time soon that dude would probably still fight for free in a parking lot in iowa if he had to of course i hope he gets out before he gets his eggs scrambled too much
MMA,not_removed,i think its because most people in this sub would rather watch gsp fight a worthy challenger like wonderboy maia woodley or lawler
MMA,not_removed,hi your submission was removed from rmma because it broke one of our rules your post would be better suited as a comment in a current stickied thread httpswwwredditcomrmmawikirules if you disagree with this decision or if you think we made a mistake please use this link to
MMA,not_removed,frankie was never my fighter in the world
MMA,not_removed,came here for frankie stayed for chael
MMA,not_removed,he likes frankie but he just like mcgregor more
MMA,not_removed,fast forwarded for chael stayed for florians depressing gaze
MMA,not_removed,holy shit that was fucking scary
MMA,not_removed,holy shit
MMA,not_removed,they even did the tale of the tape thing at the beginning of the videobut they left off the sharks measurements
MMA,not_removed,holy shit that is pretty scary did he do well afterward or was he kinda shaken up
MMA,not_removed,holy shit even the commentator broke when he realized
MMA,not_removed,heard he was planning for his ufc debut at taking his training very seriously for the socalled sharktank division
MMA,not_removed,watching it live was insane when he went under i thought he was done for
MMA,not_removed,the shark is most disrespected opponent ever
MMA,not_removed,he didnt have a scratch on him but he was pretty bloody shaken so was julian wilson who was in the heat with him it was the open final and as soon as julian saw mick in trouble he started paddling towards the shark and was going to help fight he broke down midinterview when he started to realize what had just happened
MMA,not_removed,its heartwarming to see the genuine care another human being has for another human being im truly glad hes ok not everyone can say they tangled with a shark and are ok fucking scary shit
MMA,not_removed,scared the fuck out of me
MMA,not_removed,these wiki posts are never funny
MMA,not_removed,hahaa so funny time for removal
MMA,not_removed,hehe fuck outta here
MMA,not_removed,theyre perfect for people who want to get banned
MMA,not_removed,massages will for sure help i know ill get shit for this but if you want to continue working your flexibility and keeping yourself limber i reccomend yoga believe it or not hour every days will even make a difference ive always struggled with higher placed kicks because my legs arent super flexible but since taking yoga ive noticed a huge difference in reachability likewise i dont feel as sore in places that are over stretching its just soreness from muscle growth and work now i also think it can help with some mentality aspects but thats more just what you want to make it with your attitude than anything
MMA,not_removed,invest in a foam roller
MMA,not_removed,thai massage is good and also yoga yoga is always good
MMA,not_removed,cbd oil bro
MMA,not_removed,foam roller yoga massage cbd oil if thats your thing those are all the good answers and now theyre in one place
MMA,not_removed,thank you all for the tips very helpful so i should cut back on the all out stretching and go for a little with foam roller and yoga
MMA,not_removed,i thought this was gonna be another conor shitpost about stiff fighters
MMA,not_removed,hes on that johny hendricks diet
MMA,not_removed,the hokage wont be too happy about this
MMA,not_removed,oh japan never change
MMA,not_removed,in bas ruttens voice the knee to the liverrrr
MMA,not_removed,cro cop studied lil mac vs king hippo for that one
MMA,not_removed,i dont like these shorts on cro cop there i said it
MMA,not_removed,holy shit cro cop is still fighting hes one of the scariest mother fuckers ive ever seen in his prime he was basically the terminator
MMA,not_removed,ten years later and cro cop might win it again
MMA,not_removed,i understand that its japan and that looked very sketchy but war crocop i will cheer for this guy until i die absolute legend
MMA,not_removed,how does this look fixed in any way that knee was absolutely brutal
MMA,not_removed,rizin is like an anime come to life
MMA,not_removed,that knee went in so deep it almost came out his back brutal
MMA,not_removed,god its like he fought paul blart
MMA,not_removed,god i love japan
MMA,not_removed,left knee cemetery
MMA,not_removed,that knee was brutal
MMA,not_removed,the japanese crowds are so pleasant man no unnecessary booing and you can hear impacts of punches and kicks
MMA,not_removed,rizin isnt regulated and there arent any drug tests so theres no weight classes a fighter can nearly do we the fuck they want inside and outside the ring and you get to watch legendary fighters who may be popping beat the shit out people just for those that dont know its pretty fucking great
MMA,not_removed,theres a non zero percent chance that thats a dive right
MMA,not_removed,i really need those rizin ff gloves where can i get them
MMA,not_removed,hes lucky sasuke didnt show up
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,what the actual fuck
MMA,not_removed,the rematch should headline
MMA,not_removed,very satisfying fight
MMA,not_removed,damn this guy was my favorite sumo wrestler back when i was in college was so psyched when he won that the emperors cup sad to see him like this now
MMA,not_removed,wish theyd pronounce the name right reminds of when tj houshmanzadeh just started playing and our local commentator called him hooshmondzay lol
MMA,not_removed,mike pyle ronda rouseyesque in his head mooment joe
MMA,not_removed,dont skip abs day
MMA,not_removed,baruto is former sumo wrestler and he managed to get him self to lvl thats why he is so popular in japan
MMA,not_removed,apparently this guys liver is in his solar plex
MMA,not_removed,who the fuck is stupid enough to watch this shit
MMA,not_removed,i think that knee burst an unchewed ham in barutos lower intestine thats what got him
MMA,not_removed,rizin is a fucking joke
MMA,not_removed,this is fake right
MMA,not_removed,fake
MMA,not_removed,lol that fat fuck couldnt take a knee on that gut
MMA,not_removed,ped physical enlarging doughnuts
MMA,not_removed,mark my words hendricks will look close to this within years after retirement
MMA,not_removed,hell try to make for his next fight
MMA,not_removed,incase you dont know the dude was a sumo wrestler
MMA,not_removed,cultivating mass
MMA,not_removed,believe it
MMA,not_removed,naruto go train more with sasuke
MMA,not_removed,dongity dongity dong
MMA,not_removed,aim for the bandaid
MMA,not_removed,how dare you
MMA,not_removed,and fedor was sarah connor
MMA,not_removed,we getting that posthonda boost boys
MMA,not_removed,he just knocked out three dudes in hours
MMA,not_removed,and he just knocked out king mo a couple of days ago
MMA,not_removed,his nickname is terminator is back at rizin
MMA,not_removed,nothing sketchy about a fat moose of a man collapsing from a knee to the gut by a roided up level striker
MMA,not_removed,id pay to see anyone saying that baruto took a dive to take that knee and stay standing
MMA,not_removed,ufc fanboys have always hated other orgs getting attention and have to talk shit do you really think they need to fix a fight between crocop and an amateur level fighter it was a mismatch for sure but no way was that fixed
MMA,not_removed,pat militic wasnt fighting tonight was he
MMA,not_removed,paul blaruto
MMA,not_removed,about as brutal as a wet paper towel
MMA,not_removed,yeah i remember watching bas rutten dominate in pancrase on vhs i ordered from japan thousands at the venue some of the most popular fights but in absolute and almost eerie silence it made for a unique and really strange atmosphere but oh boy was it spectacular to hear the open hand strikes and padded shinkicks land i know fighting evolved but i sometimes miss that format mostly because of el guapo of course
MMA,not_removed,idk i mean a guy with almost fights just fought a fighter who had probably never been hit like that before
MMA,not_removed,baruto who is very new to mma just took a knee from a former level kick boxing legend to the liver and dropped like weve seen many seasoned fighters do who have taken the same shot i dont see anything shady about that at all
MMA,not_removed,i think he dove because the ref wasnt stopping the fight and he didnt want to get hit any more so it was a dive of sorts but not because he was faking it
MMA,not_removed,its a mismatch not a fix you dont need to fix a fight between an amateur level fighter and one of the best mma fighters of all time
MMA,not_removed,cro cop won and a dope watch and a cruise to spain second place got and the two third place guys got each who knows what they are getting paid to show up though thats all bonuses
MMA,not_removed,shitter was full
MMA,not_removed,someone needs to invent doughnuts that make you lose weight im pretty sure theres a market there
MMA,not_removed,man fedor was my favorite he looked like an average joe and he could change his fighting style based on his opponent like no one ive seen but im not really an authority on mma so correct me if im wrong also im pretty sure i read somewhere he used to train by chopping down trees and pushing tires and shit straight out of rocky
MMA,not_removed,you mean postronda yeah im definitely not a regular follower of mma i followed more closely like years ago and was big fan of guys like fedor gsp anderson silva and cro cop the only guys i really like now are jon jones and anthony johnson but jones cant keep his fucking nose clean
MMA,not_removed,most impressive of the by miles
MMA,not_removed,really
MMA,not_removed,i was with you until you said moose i really think we really have to go with something fatter like a hippopotamus in this case
MMA,not_removed,right that slow motion shot of his stomache was hard to watch haha
MMA,not_removed,baruto is a former sumo wrestler they are known for never taking dives or accepting bribes from yakuza i highly doubt he would do this given his background in the cleanest sport in the world
MMA,not_removed,its important for people to not swallow whole hams i dont think people told baruto that
MMA,not_removed,this is anecdotal but ive been an mma fan since the early ufcpride days and iirc fedor was a big part of changing the way fighters worked out before he came around s c was basically just lifting weights and assorted cardio then this pudgy russian guy comes along and he doesnt do a single bench press hes swinging kettle bells swinging sledgehammers and flipping tractor tires it was so out of the norm but it was effective he was smaller but stronger than all the other heavyweights he became a dominant champ in the hardest division to be dominant in functional strength only really took off in mma after he came along
MMA,not_removed,jones cant keep his fucking nose clean well that was before but now we found out that hes a steroid user too
MMA,not_removed,you mean postronda awwwwwwww lol
MMA,not_removed,yes lol ã¿ã¼ããã¼ã¿ã¼ ã¤ãº ããã¯
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,cleanest sport sumo lost a ton of respect in japan due to rampant match fixing the thing about sumo is that if you lose a majority of your fights in a basho youll drop a rank and the lower ranked sumo wrestlers are literally manservants for the best wrestlers they have to cook their food clean for them pretty much be their slave high ranked wrestlers dont want to go back to that shit so they colluded to make sure no one had a losing record
MMA,not_removed,idk if thats sarcasm or not but sumo has plenty of match throwing httpsenwikipediaorgwikimatchfixinginprofessionalsumo read some of this for a little bit more info i first heard about the how common match throwing was in sumo from the book freakonomics edit but i also doubt it was a dive baruto just has very little experience against fighters in the ring
MMA,not_removed,hes a grownass augustus gloop
MMA,not_removed,i said that just as a general expression for someone who gets into trouble but yeah i forgot he actually tested positive for cocaine i listened to his interview on joe rohans podcast last month and he seems like a nice whos intelligent but unfortunately hes also immature and got devoured by his ego and addiction problem he sounded like the estrogen blocker incident gave him a muchneeded dose of humility and i really hope he turns his life around
MMA,not_removed,hell figure it out lol
MMA,not_removed,ha thats awesome perfectly fitting
MMA,not_removed,was i too subtle sumo literally got shut down completely for months and half the makuuchi ranks expelled years ago because gambling was so rampant
MMA,not_removed,its obviously sarcasm
MMA,not_removed,yeah i was being sarcastic they have warnings about gang affiliation when you enter the venue even
MMA,not_removed,oh yea sounded like you were referencing the coke incident jon always tries to act like he learned something and puts on that persona of a good christian but in reality hes just a steroid cheater to be honest now i still want to see him fight and there are a lot of other fighters on roids probably but that really had me wondering how long was he using it for would his entire dominating run through the division even happen without steroids if he did use them back then
MMA,not_removed,would his entire dominating run through the division even happen without steroids honestly i think it would first of all the dude is insanely talented no matter what second of all theres no evidence he was using steroids when he made that run
MMA,not_removed,that is being quite naive to believe that someones who pops positive did it for the first time especially since his brothers have popped as well
MMA,not_removed,lol this guys triggered
MMA,not_removed,dude shut up
MMA,not_removed,you get personal with people over the internet might wanna rethink your life priorities
MMA,not_removed,gets called out for saying stupid things and loses argument pulls circlejerk card
MMA,not_removed,not as gross as your attitude
MMA,not_removed,man a lot of people were sleeping on carawayincluding myself sterling had been looking great leading up to this fight but caraway got this
MMA,not_removed,stupid question i was watching and they showed all the fights except this one how do i avoid that in the future watch a pirate stream or is that just not possible
MMA,not_removed,fight pass exclusive can get lucky maybe but i havent seen a pirate stream of fight pass i just pay the a month
MMA,not_removed,ahh ok thanks
MMA,not_removed,idk your financial situation but if you havent checked it out its pretty great especially if you are a newer fan ive watched mma for a while but i missed a shit load of fights along the way and only really got hardcore about it in the past couple years probably i used to only follow certain fighters now i pretty much watch everything fight pass gives you a ton of fights so i think its pretty worth it but if youve been hardcore about it for like years or dont give a fuck about other leagues like wec back in the day then its prob a waste every now and then i dont watch a lot of fights so ill cancel my sub until a good exclusive comes around like the bisping anderson fight
MMA,not_removed,he looked like a highlevel gatekeeper and sterling continues to unimpress as far as showing no threat of striking whatsoever
MMA,not_removed,i think caraway would have finished him in a rounder
MMA,not_removed,httpstwittercomarielhelwani also joining us on tomorrows httpstwittercombryancaraway same time and place as usual pm et am pt pm bst on httpstwittercommmafighting leave above link unaltered messagecomposetotweetpostersubjectsuggestion httpsgithubcomjoealcorntweetposter httpsgithubcomjoealcorntweetposterissues
MMA,not_removed,came her for spoilers was disappointed
MMA,not_removed,hopefully he becomes more active
MMA,not_removed,ill fall asleep
MMA,not_removed,i dont get why everyone feels like they can speak on caraway if they know his ceiling or something its ignorant and its pretty arrogant on behalf of the fans to be so presumptuous about a guy who lives and breathes his hobby if hes improving i say let him improve rather than pigeonholing him
MMA,not_removed,great to see why would you say that no one likes him
MMA,not_removed,literally no one is excited to see bryan caraway speak
MMA,not_removed,lmao nobody cares about him
MMA,not_removed,ya if he faces wrestlers like faber dillashaw and garbrandt who have far more superior striking hes going to get fucked up
MMA,not_removed,i bet on like fights that night where my fighter lost and left me thinking this same thing
MMA,not_removed,yes love watching him on the ground
MMA,not_removed,i agree but people do that about all sorts of fighters theres a huge difference between saying soandso is terrible at striking and soandso has improvements that need to be made with striking people get so fixated on what a fighter is today they lose focus on what a fighter could be tomorrow its all a learning process
MMA,not_removed,actually you do considering you have so many caraway bashing posts in your history lol
MMA,not_removed,meisha does
MMA,not_removed,whats up with your caraway obsession
MMA,not_removed,its ok buddy just because he doesnt ask about you doesnt mean what you had wasnt special but you gotta let it go
MMA,not_removed,i do and i think it added to this show tomm
MMA,not_removed,it sure looks like you do whoa
MMA,not_removed,does garbrandt have any wrestling history i thought he was more of a boxer
MMA,not_removed,whats wrong with the gate keeper it describes some fighters perfectly
MMA,not_removed,yeah why dont we call them holderbackers s
MMA,not_removed,that logic is absurd the lingo is well established and we all know exactly whats being described
MMA,not_removed,you caught me im actually secretly in love with him now all i have to do is get miesha out of the picture first step is to find someone willing to bang her
MMA,not_removed,she doesnt love him like i do
MMA,not_removed,you caught me
MMA,not_removed,all american turned down scholarships to focus on boxing per wikipedia also trains at tam

MMA,not_removed,please keep the comments civil
MMA,not_removed,oh boy are you barking up the wrong tree
MMA,not_removed,check him out if youre not familiar with him regardless of what you think of him i think everyone here is familiar with him by now
MMA,not_removed,i think he messed up his first impression he got fired and straight up started his podcast think he should have taken some time to plan things out a little better cause it all seems haphazard as hell his first impression was bad which is why he only has subs i dont see him doing well until he doesnt plan things out properly and get some good advice
MMA,not_removed,i actually have and its not my cup of tea doesnt even have to do with the fact hes a grown man dressed like an emo
MMA,not_removed,robin black is a taxi driver and jack slack is uber
MMA,not_removed,ive nothing against him but hes just not my cub of tea ill stick with heavy hands and jack slack
MMA,not_removed,im good
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats gonna to be a no for me dog
MMA,not_removed,i think his show should be called robin is about fighting because so far all ive heard is him talking about how obsessed he is with it
MMA,not_removed,i like his mentality of combat sports im subbed for that show particular however too many daily vids for my liking but im not really a podcast person so i dont want to listen to one person every day even jre which this sub has gotten me into i just watch it when certain guests are on so im not just hating on robin i cant listen to jack slack too much either though i love his breakdown articles and shorter vids think robin just has to find his groove and his audience will naturally find him in like less than a month is amazing momentum if you actually think about it not like hes some famous fighteretc himself
MMA,not_removed,there is some karmic irony in the fact that his proudest analogy was his downfall when he used it to describe himself in relation to ariel its got that nolanseinfeld vibe to it where people repeat a line in the end of the movieepisode and now its got a completely different meaning i can imagine robin working as an uber driver arriving at a location and ariel is there waiting for his ride at first he decides to just drive away but then he realizes he needs the money so he turns around and picks ariel up they chuckle about the irony of the situation while robin drives him to the ufc event hes covering then robins car breaks down a few minutes later robin covered in grease is trying to fix his engine but its to no avail ariel is late for the presser so he steps out of the uber and waves down a taxi hops in and before riding off says you know robin theres nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man but it still feels damn good
MMA,not_removed,a show set in the grown up version of peewees playhouse isnt where i tend to go for my mma content
MMA,not_removed,no he sucks
MMA,not_removed,id rather not to be fair
MMA,not_removed,are we still disliking robin black
MMA,not_removed,how the hell did he get subs
MMA,not_removed,his voice
MMA,not_removed,no
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,i think everyone here is familiar with him by now which is why he only has subscribers
MMA,not_removed,why did he get fired
MMA,not_removed,robin black is the angry bus driver that always wanted to fly planes but they wouldnt let him pile up phonebooks on the pilots seat
MMA,not_removed,cub of tea loved his fight with doo ho chai
MMA,not_removed,are you referring to people shitting on black after losing his job or referring to black shitting on ariel after losing his job
MMA,not_removed,but if you find joy in someone else losing their job then you are an absolute cunt no youre not there are plenty of occasions when someone deserves to lose their job for perfectly valid reasons
MMA,not_removed,you must have unsubscribed from our newsletter
MMA,not_removed,youre such a problem child
MMA,not_removed,he only started it recently after fight network suddenly finished his contract is a good base to work from if he comes up with a popular format
MMA,not_removed,not sure he posted a video about it but i couldnt be arsed enough to watch it watch it and let us know
MMA,not_removed,i believe fight network is rebranding and dropped all their mma stuff
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,haha im not changing it now
MMA,not_removed,both sucked tbh
MMA,not_removed,black lost his only job ariel lost a side gig
MMA,not_removed,the ariel thing is maybe why a few people dont like him since ariel is almost regarded as a hero in the mma world also their is this gem httpsyoutubeqrczcajjca
MMA,not_removed,i will not be rused
MMA,not_removed,yolo bro
MMA,not_removed,wasnt black doing the ufc breakdowns too by that point
MMA,not_removed,well you dont have to think ariel is a hero to see the nastiness of blacks comment at the time but yeah black was already viewed as annoying and amateurish by many and the ariel thing fueled the fire edit typo
MMA,not_removed,i think a lot of people took the quote out of hand i dont know if im right but when i look at the quote i feel like hes trying to say ariel is like most other mma reporters he just tries to stir the pot and get interesting info in which case hed be a taxi say whereas in robins case he tries to give personalized flashy fight breakdowns etc to make the viewing more entertaining like an uber driver might like i said i dont know if this is true but it makes a lot more sense in my mind than what people think
MMA,not_removed,this
MMA,not_removed,yeah but saying it in the context of ariel getting laid off is what made it shitty
MMA,not_removed,long as you no smokin da heefer and listening to hames brown hecords i help you win da belch edit porra
MMA,not_removed,i laughed way too hard at that renato instantly calling them out on their jits problems than offering to help sage because his rich parents will take care of him this is gradea renato

MMA,not_removed,never thought id see the three of these guys together under any circumstances lol
MMA,not_removed,naw his main target vinny magalhaes isnt in the ufc plus he would have problems with the heebock deal since hes sponsored by fruits vegetables
MMA,not_removed,the reem is really good as well in case you havent seen it
MMA,not_removed,nate diaz did road to war before was pretty good
MMA,not_removed,thats racist

MMA,not_removed,and the gunslinger followed
MMA,not_removed,wow mad respect
MMA,not_removed,wow much better than i thought he would do he used a nice elbow block in there worlds better than freddie flintoffs attempt at boxing
MMA,not_removed,fuck cm punk dana needs to get this guy and cancel the apocalypse
MMA,not_removed,best known for thor and luthor gtfo hes god damn stringer bell show some respect
MMA,not_removed,the year old best known for roles in the thor films and bbc series luthor best known for what now that man is stringer bell
MMA,not_removed,lookin good string
MMA,not_removed,dont fuck with the gunslinger
MMA,not_removed,man this guy is a stud hope they make him the next james bond
MMA,not_removed,their trainerspromoters did a good job matching him up against a guy of similar skill level unlike the ufc with cm punk
MMA,not_removed,best known for roles in the thor films and bbc series luthor ah now
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,best known for thor cmon man
MMA,not_removed,on this weeks episode of idris elba is awesome
MMA,not_removed,so its that old discovery show fight quest but with a famous dude cool
MMA,not_removed,i think i speak for everyone when i say the fuck i didnt think that idris elba could be more of a badass than he already is
MMA,not_removed,what a baller huge respect for idris true alpha male and good actor too
MMA,not_removed,for anyone that was worried about him not being up to the standards of roland deschain you need to ask your mum how much she drank while she was pregnant with you
MMA,not_removed,shut that door yo
MMA,not_removed,professional lets get hams a fuckin license and blood tests woohoooimapro edit braced for the hate
MMA,not_removed,stringer lol
MMA,not_removed,most known for his roles in the thor movies and bbc show luther did you watch the wire bro
MMA,not_removed,love edris this is awesome cant wait to see the documentary that the article mentions
MMA,not_removed,bet stringer could ko avon now
MMA,not_removed,dana just came
MMA,not_removed,literally the coolest dude ever damn
MMA,not_removed,a real rocknrolla
MMA,not_removed,not the face
MMA,not_removed,dos equis needs to hire this mother fucker as the most interesting man alive
MMA,not_removed,look out omar comin
MMA,not_removed,lol iÂ´m just watching the wire episode of season
MMA,not_removed,heh its like hes pete in friends
MMA,not_removed,anyone else surprised thats madonnas real ig account it would be dope if she also browses rmma
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxbfzzowflmy
MMA,not_removed,his opponent looked decenton his level
MMA,not_removed,idris elba much more legit than joe rogan who doesnt even spar
MMA,not_removed,cedric daniels also had the physique of a mma fighter
MMA,not_removed,how much did they pay the dude to throw the fight
MMA,not_removed,dating madonna history tells us his career will go to shit now shell want to be in a movie with him or a tv show which will be shitty
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt touch madonna though wtf is he thinking
MMA,not_removed,kicks were decent punches need work overall for a year old actor not bad at all
MMA,not_removed,til you can throw elbows in kickboxing
MMA,not_removed,first thought when reading the title was wtf after reading article and watching video god damn he looks amazing for
MMA,not_removed,as is elba needed to get any hotter i wish they would make him the next james bond from the way idris talks he thinks its too late for him to play the role
MMA,not_removed,a year old actor what a disgrace to the sport of kickboxing s
MMA,not_removed,why link via conor mcgregors website godam shill
MMA,not_removed,you guys are giving him too much credit no doubt he was fed a can
MMA,not_removed,idris looks great regardless of his age or not but how is this professional is this some kind of stunt or can you just buy your way in is the other guy seriously a professional fighter too no offense but ive seen smokers at higher levels
MMA,not_removed,down vote me if you like but if i were a professional kickboxer id be pissed that they fast passed a famous actor into my realm
MMA,not_removed,all i want to know is where the fuck is wallace
MMA,not_removed,now he gets all those sweet pies from the hood moms
MMA,not_removed,avon could still take him
MMA,not_removed,is it just me or does cutty look a lot like herb dean
MMA,not_removed,he actually trained with buakaw for a bit before this fight seems like hes been into muay thai for a while now
MMA,not_removed,how old is he the wire was ten years ago more probably theres hope for us all i guess
MMA,not_removed,at the age of too and is also dating madonna the guy doesnt stop
MMA,not_removed,doesnt he also have a tv show where he just does random expensive hobbies in one episode he broke a land speed record in some place in england and next he learned to fly a stunt plane
MMA,not_removed,while guarding the bifrost bridge and watching over the nine realms nonetheless
MMA,not_removed,and hes a fucking knight
MMA,not_removed,and singerand rapper
MMA,not_removed,tbf a pro fight only means youre paid for it there is no metric on skill to be considered a pro fighter any star could be a pro fighter because of their previous popularity would sell enough to pay them id rather see idris go up against a kick boxer version of mickey gall in the amateur circuit
MMA,not_removed,he also competed in drag racing for his new show prob did some other amazing stuff as well but i havent kept up
MMA,not_removed,youre forgetting his greatest achievement bearing an uncanny resemblance to mc grindah
MMA,not_removed,not to mention everything he did in the no limits series especially the aerobatics idris is a savage
MMA,not_removed,you forgot major
MMA,not_removed,life is just not fair hehe
MMA,not_removed,stringer bell kept it all so low key people already forgot about him
MMA,not_removed,damn i loved him in luther
MMA,not_removed,uhhhhh more like charles miner temporary vice president of the northeast region for dunder mifflin following ryan howards departure he is aware of the effect he has on women
MMA,not_removed,he was crazy good in beasts of no nation by far my favorite performance from him
MMA,not_removed,they actually spelt it luthor in that article i mean come on just google the damn thing
MMA,not_removed,pacific rim dude
MMA,not_removed,natty
MMA,not_removed,hes always looked good
MMA,not_removed,on a scale of cody mckenzie to rumble johnson how blacksplosive would you rate him
MMA,not_removed,he also is a professional racecar driver holds the land speed record in britain also hes a dj lol
MMA,not_removed,well he is in reddit terms thats out of toes in the grave
MMA,not_removed,thats why peopel wanted him to be the next james bond
MMA,not_removed,bit unfair to punk to put him against someone so much more skillful than him
MMA,not_removed,out of those who would be the bigger draw
MMA,not_removed,york hall yes some boxing shows too it is used for open workouts for the bigger uk boxing cards that take place in london
MMA,not_removed,looks like york hall to me always liked that place
MMA,not_removed,dada chuck
MMA,not_removed,a tad too old at this point i reckon
MMA,not_removed,as long as its based on his acting ability rather than trying to be diverse
MMA,not_removed,cm punk in the ufc is like if idris got signed to glory
MMA,not_removed,a little test never hurt anybody
MMA,not_removed,i thought all actors did this they bulk up so quick they gotta be taking something no tests at the film set
MMA,not_removed,no mention of pacific rim
MMA,not_removed,he did win a golden globe for luther super underrated show btw
MMA,not_removed,and months instead of days
MMA,not_removed,technically the difference between a pro and an amateur isnt skill level but whether they get paid or not so as long as they got a couple of quid in their pocket their a professional
MMA,not_removed,idris elba can now officially add professional fighter to his cv and now his opponent can add professional actor to his resume
MMA,not_removed,show some videos of your fights
MMA,not_removed,he pointedly only took a lowlevel local show because he didnt want to get fast passed if the fact that youre watching a cell phone video doesnt clue you in this was not a payperview you dont have to be a famous actor to fight in an entrylevel kickboxing event you just have to have trained and signed up
MMA,not_removed,well let us know how you really feel once you actually become a professional kickboxer
MMA,not_removed,knocking out fools in creed
MMA,not_removed,where wallace at stringer
MMA,not_removed,id pay good money to see if this fight wallace for reals elba would murder him for reals
MMA,not_removed,david wallace cfo not his initials common mistake
MMA,not_removed,psssssh avon couldnt even man up it do it himself
MMA,not_removed,i thinks not spoilers
MMA,not_removed,glass forehead
MMA,not_removed,i cant wait to see that documentary
MMA,not_removed,buakaw still the darkest man in kickboxing
MMA,not_removed,according to the article
MMA,not_removed,stringer bell dies at the end of season which was so the wire was years ago damn it doesnt seem that long ago also spoiler alert
MMA,not_removed,we can leave out the madonna part if we are talking accomplishments
MMA,not_removed,and is also dating madonna eh
MMA,not_removed,he is gross
MMA,not_removed,shes almost
MMA,not_removed,while others are downtalking elba dating madonna think about it this way madonna has likely tried every single kink in the book and added a few chapters or even volumes on her own if there were someone not a porn star whose name i could think of off the top of my head to live out every perverted fantasy in my head and who would be totally ok with it it would probably be her so yeah mad props to him for enjoying his time the right way
MMA,not_removed,bro shes like
MMA,not_removed,thats actually a negative
MMA,not_removed,at this point thats gotta be like throwing a hot dog down a hallway doesnt it stewie
MMA,not_removed,also dating madonna whyjpg
MMA,not_removed,king of speed and no limits
MMA,not_removed,he races cars professionally that was really a one off thing
MMA,not_removed,really what show is this
MMA,not_removed,thats what this fight is for
MMA,not_removed,i like to think stringer bell became heimdall when he died
MMA,not_removed,you taking notes on a criminal fucking conspiracy
MMA,not_removed,like a degree day
MMA,not_removed,his economics lessons live on in tha streetz though
MMA,not_removed,kelly you wanted me david i thought rajineeganda was a boys name god damn i love that show
MMA,not_removed,finally someone with some sense around here
MMA,not_removed,miner i hardly know her
MMA,not_removed,ok no no no no no you know what im going to new york and i am going to talk to david wallace im going to tell him everything and im sorry to say youre screwed and you know what you are gonna be through and im sorry im sorry to do that to you do you even know how paper is made its not like steel you dont put it into a furnace if you put paper into a furnace you know what would happen youd ruin it
MMA,not_removed,hed be better then jesse eisenberg
MMA,not_removed,came here to say this more highquality mma writing for you
MMA,not_removed,thick tight solid
MMA,not_removed,lol not even
MMA,not_removed,seen him dj in london hes sick
MMA,not_removed,my girlfriend has made it clear that if given the opportunity shed fuck idris elba in front of my face and i honestly dont think i could blame her at this point
MMA,not_removed,god
MMA,not_removed,that didnt stop the ufc from making the gall fight
MMA,not_removed,i would guess punk basing my answer on the hypothesis that his fans would be more likely to purchase ppv but if idris used his sexy charisma to work over the media and really sell his fight he could really bring in a large number of new buyers
MMA,not_removed,thanks knew it looked familiar
MMA,not_removed,dada chum
MMA,not_removed,dada chocolate al
MMA,not_removed,dida chi
MMA,not_removed,dont know why you are getting downvoted too old for a franchise maneuver he will be almost by the time the first film is released for reference craig was when casino royale was released its not going to happen the studio will end up doing another pseudo reboot with considerably younger actors who both a have more longevity for the franchise and b are easier to work withpush around and cheaper
MMA,not_removed,roger moore was and he killed it
MMA,not_removed,yeah and too dark
MMA,not_removed,white dudes arent the only ones with acting skills
MMA,not_removed,you can argue too old of you want i wont people are aging better than ever these days and the guy is in amazing shape but how the fuck would you argue the dude doesnt have the acting chops hes easily the equal of anyone thats played the role and significantly better than most of them without question get out of here with your racist shit cause thats what it is this isnt some we announce the next bond will be black bullshit that you could pretend you were concerned for the series about hint thats not why people say it this was a specific actor being called to play it and for the record hes basically said he doesnt want do it anymore because of people like you that will make it all about the first black bond instead of his acting im sorry if you think youre being attacked or that youre not making a heavily racist statement or something but your post is filled with so much ignorance and your comment isnt innocent its actually pretty vile
MMA,not_removed,never seen luther any good check out the wire
MMA,not_removed,see you and i know this i think in most peoples heads it says oh shit hes good then
MMA,not_removed,damn
MMA,not_removed,because its a bunch of idris fanatics most likely if this is the highlight of idris and the best he looked in that fight looked more like a sparring session then of course you have to wonder if the management of idris just like rourke did in his boxing fight btw paid the dude a couple hundred bucks to not win the fight i mean what publicist wants their client to get his ass whooped on film by a nobody anybody that knows a little about mma would see that the other guy is clearly holding back and that idris even in that highlight seems to be done dead tired i dont want to know how pathetic he looked the rest of the fight they didnt want to put out there dont get me wrong the guy deserves major props for fighting at that age against a much younger and probably more skilled and stronger guy for fighting period but dont give me this bs that he beat the guy fair and square its very likely the guy got paid a few hundred bucks maybe a couple thousand to take it easy on idris they both win he gets a nice payday before he probably quits the sport and idris has a nice story out there that said this isnt what sport or fighting is about youre supposed to compete
MMA,not_removed,was it professional or not
MMA,not_removed,so i cant have an opinion on sports unless im a professional athlete sounds like you have your work cut out for you teaching that premise to everyone
MMA,not_removed,holy shit theyre the same person how did i not know that
MMA,not_removed,he actually got knocked out for the movie they wanted a realistic ko and he agreed
MMA,not_removed,avon had a gunshot wound golden gloves as a youngin hed take stringer
MMA,not_removed,what a fucking nutjob
MMA,not_removed,mongal
MMA,not_removed,you should put spoiler tags around that
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,weve all got one what the fuck was i thinking ex its a process
MMA,not_removed,not bad for a year old
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i still would
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,to each his own but i dont find madonna attractive so thats my issue
MMA,not_removed,youre forgetting a fact that totally invalidates your otherwise interesting point shes old
MMA,not_removed,does everyone have fetishes or am i the only human appqrently without
MMA,not_removed,nah id rather try a new kink with a woman who hasnt tried all the kinks already
MMA,not_removed,yeah but half of her is probably not eligible to vote yet
MMA,not_removed,michael would organize an improntu racial seminarconference room meeting so fast it would make your head spin if he saw the amount of profiling going on in this thread these people need to learn what it means to be a hero honestempatheticrespectfulopenminded
MMA,not_removed,what does he spin
MMA,not_removed,cucked again
MMA,not_removed,ok bernie
MMA,not_removed,gross
MMA,not_removed,i think cm punk vs mike jackson the journalist guy that gall first fought wouldve made a lot more sense in terms of their skillset ufc did the smartest thing though used punk to sell some ppvs and matched him against a goodlooking promising young kid who they can potentially make a star
MMA,not_removed,elba says as much himself if he was ten years younger then sure but i doubt theyd put that on him at
MMA,not_removed,i am definitely not claiming they are just with the whole political correctness stance society takes i hope they pick whoever it is based on their ability and not just the colour of their skin weve seen ghostbusters have to become females to fulfil some form of equality agenda and it was fucking awful jobs have to fulfil some form of diversity requirements in football soccer theres talks theres not enough black male managers why cant we just focus on who is best for the jobrole and then be happy with that
MMA,not_removed,how am i arguing he doesnt have the acting chops i havent watched a single thing hes been in all i know is in the media here in the uk theres been cries for a black james bond for years all im saying is if his acting ability is right for the role go for it just dont let it be because you need a token
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,lol you can get it delivered to your goddamn house dude and trt doses will cost you a month at most
MMA,not_removed,luther is so good
MMA,not_removed,true i know plenty of people who have fought professionally who i or a great deal of the amateurs i know could beat but people hear pro and think good hes retired now but i was actually friends with a guy who at one point was ranked the absolute bottom of his weight class in the british circuit as in on boxrec out of however many hundred fighters in his weightclass he was lets say he was ranked he didnt win a single fight in his career and lost of his fights by ko but he still loved bragging on social media about how he was a pro and how much he loves the grind etc bit annoying actually
MMA,not_removed,lol amusing how you created a whole story out of your assumptions and idris fanatics take off the tinfoil hat mate
MMA,not_removed,you dont even have to have an amateur record to enter a professional muay thai bout iirc
MMA,not_removed,you can have an opinion on it but it wont really matter just like medical advice from people who arent doctors and since idris elba actually had a sanctioned fight youll be entering his realm now if you ever plan to enter it
MMA,not_removed,wow it is
MMA,not_removed,he is actually an awesome actor also watch fruitville station
MMA,not_removed,im gonna need a source on that
MMA,not_removed,prime barksdale youd have to back against the bigger bell glass jaw aside avon showed has golden gloves pedigree and street mentality
MMA,not_removed,self confessed glass head though
MMA,not_removed,rmadlads
MMA,not_removed,no he should go fuck himself
MMA,not_removed,more like nostalgia pussy idris is just living out a teenage fantasy he had after watching the like a virgin music video for the first time
MMA,not_removed,too famous lots of railroading
MMA,not_removed,i mean yeah shes famous but hardly relevant these days hey if he actually likes her though then its all good i know if i were him id go for something less beat up and hotter but to each their own
MMA,not_removed,the cocks that pussy has seen
MMA,not_removed,we all would even if only for the story
MMA,not_removed,its a decent side grade from angela in accounting
MMA,not_removed,her vag is like in cat years
MMA,not_removed,well good thing you arent dating her
MMA,not_removed,theyre not forgetting theyre choosing to pretend
MMA,not_removed,you will find out one day
MMA,not_removed,your fetish is that you have no fetishes
MMA,not_removed,you live a sheltered life son mix it up
MMA,not_removed,techno hip hop
MMA,not_removed,its jokes man
MMA,not_removed,difference is that elba is black and by that i mean hell age magnificently and will look when he is white guys tend to wrinkle up way earlier
MMA,not_removed,i think its pretty clear what your real opinion is
MMA,not_removed,because relying on that got us the incredibly unrepresentative white male dominated job market of today ideally itd be naturally equal but theres centuries of injustice to make up for
MMA,not_removed,if you havent watched a single thing hes been in then perhaps you shouldnt comment on his potential acting roles
MMA,not_removed,its heart breaking his partner in the show tranes kickboxing as well
MMA,not_removed,mate another brit hence making my point thanks
MMA,not_removed,something tells me a random guy couldnt get a match at that event
MMA,not_removed,what about an oncologist that hasnt had cancer
MMA,not_removed,and chronicle
MMA,not_removed,fruitvale
MMA,not_removed,and the later seasons of friday night lights
MMA,not_removed,i first saw him in the office had a hard time taking him seriously at first in the wire but that went away pretty quick hes a hell of an actor
MMA,not_removed,but dont watch four
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,member
MMA,not_removed,i dunno about that he was in a guy ritchie movie and thats his ex not sure if that fantasy would hold
MMA,not_removed,when you are you remember madonna in the he thinks its awesome
MMA,not_removed,speak for your self
MMA,not_removed,cat years well how else are you supposed to age pussy
MMA,not_removed,i bet shes so old her pussy has oil repositories
MMA,not_removed,httpsvidmehcky
MMA,not_removed,thats an interesting combo
MMA,not_removed,i dont mean to presume i know anything about your relationship but i know it feels that way but if something like this was really said its basically a matter of time before she values someone higher than you and acts on it dont you feel disrespected by that you can do better brother i dont know your life and i dont mean to insult but i dont think anyone should have to hear that kind of a joke dont take this as me insulting you because i know nothing about you but i think you can do better
MMA,not_removed,black dont crack
MMA,not_removed,so basically what youre saying is black dont crack
MMA,not_removed,that i cannot stand the race or sex card being played constantly
MMA,not_removed,what dude literally no one worth shit defends affirmative action
MMA,not_removed,blokes on this sub have no understanding of this shit cant think beyond hurrdurrr thats no fair with no concept of the advantages they were born with
MMA,not_removed,hmm while i appreciate youre trying to get involved and ride the bandwagon i dont agree with your comment in the slightest as i have said from the start and will continue to believe if he is the right man for the job he should get it people should get what they deserve if he is right for the role by all means give it to him im just saying dont make it about race thats what hinders our civilisation more than anything we are all equal pick whoever is best i seem to be getting portrayed as some racist anti black person here but you genuinely couldnt be further from the truth i honestly believe the sooner we realise we are all the same and everything should be based on merit the better off we would be as a civilisation
MMA,not_removed,the fact you assume using mate means british shows how stupid your theory was
MMA,not_removed,httpstudycomarticlesbecomeasurgicaloncologiststepbystepcareerguidehtml they do all that then their advice and opinions matter on cancer
MMA,not_removed,and
MMA,not_removed,hell no wasnt planning on that
MMA,not_removed,none of what the little article says has a source or any proof to those claims that video is done very well but he isnt getting knocked out lol
MMA,not_removed,they did a very good job of making it look real but i still dont believe jordan actually got knocked out more likely he took a half shot and went limp and down hard right after contact was made
MMA,not_removed,mustnt have included it in the movie cos the knockdowns were fake af
MMA,not_removed,i dont this is like the very first time im hearing this news
MMA,not_removed,i member
MMA,not_removed,dem berries
MMA,not_removed,oh oh i member
MMA,not_removed,you must be one of those guys who gets revolted when you hear a girl has hooked up with other people in the past whats your logic was guy ritchie a father figure or someone who was much more alpha than idris otherwise this fantasy is true thats sort of how people end up cheating by coveting someone elses partner and acting on it sort of what happened here
MMA,not_removed,thats not how vaginas work
MMA,not_removed,if he likes madonna he should go for her shes and not nearly as skeletorscary
MMA,not_removed,in cheesecloth
MMA,not_removed,i know nothing about you but i think you can do better right you know nothing i mean for all you do know they have a healthy relationship and have that kinda sense of humor also never take advice on a relationship from a person on the internet lol
MMA,not_removed,youre very sensitive
MMA,not_removed,mate its a joke i threaten my girlfriend with some scary shit but she knows its a joke and we laugh together
MMA,not_removed,he literally just said it was a joke
MMA,not_removed,youre aware of his previous roles its clear how accomplished of an actor he is and yet you feel the need to question whether hed get the role on merit your pseudo logical cover up of your true feelings isnt fooling anyone
MMA,not_removed,o no how can u say i not be worth shit
MMA,not_removed,yea giving people of color major roles will absolutely help source material is a bullshit excuse for diversity issues when those are unfairly white male dominated as well
MMA,not_removed,youre acting like hes some random actor hes one of the most currently accomplished actors in hollywood with a ton of range has been nominated for multiple awards etc the fact that you havent seen him in anything makes it totally odd that you have such a strong opinion on casting him for james bond anyone who is familiar with his work knows hes more than qualified hes arguably a better actor than roger moore timothy dalton and pierce brosnan
MMA,not_removed,do you realize that we can see your history on reddit you are a brit just admit it and move on it might be embarrassing but be honest youre not smart enough to worm your way out of this no offense
MMA,not_removed,do i have to be a politician to have an opinion on politics do i have to be a producer to have an opinion on westworld most people dont wander through life sticking to their lane with blinders on we have peripheral knowledge
MMA,not_removed,no its true he also agreed to get shot for the wire
MMA,not_removed,if it ever happened i doubt it was a plan i cant see legal signing off on an actor to purposefully receive a brain injury
MMA,not_removed,his member members
MMA,not_removed,i member too
MMA,not_removed,you must be a fucking psyocpath for projecting like that settle the fuck down clearly youre very close to the situation enjoy how it pans out weirdo
MMA,not_removed,a close is a street with a dead end in the uk
MMA,not_removed,close is used instead of tenement sometimes here in glasgow well its meant to be just the opening entrance of the tenement its pronounced as if theres an a in there sort of like cloase i suppose i was implying that madonna has a wide uhm opening and that it would be like throwing a sausage read penis into a wide open area such as a close apparently thats not very funny certainly isnt when you have to explain it lol
MMA,not_removed,shes also not nearly as hot as her mom used to be in fact madonna still looks hitter than her in that picture
MMA,not_removed,i have already commented other than being a british actor i know very little of what hes done nor do i feel his previous jobs are relevant to the discussion if hes that good of an actor and deserves it on merit give it to him as a brit its been well documented and someone else even commented the reason he didnt want the bond gig was because of the media labelling him as the first black james bond so that surely shows that its been mentioned within the media and how ive gained wind of the subject i honestly couldnt give a shit if you think im trying to fool someone and this is the internet you are nothing to me why do i care if endirty a random person somewhere in the world has assumed im x or y im also not questioning whether he should or shouldnt get the role on merit im simply saying he should get the role on merit or not at all
MMA,not_removed,after a quick glance at his imdb i can tell you that the lie detector results are in and you lied i have explained everything youve asked previously i dont have a strong opinion i honestly couldnt care the movies are shit now anyone who is familiar with his work knows hes more than qualified well fuck me if you arent the simplest mother fucker going i have said i dont know anything about him other than the media labeling him as the first black bond and why having a black bond is good
MMA,not_removed,you can have an opinion on it but it wont really matter most people also go through life thinking and acting like they know more than they do
MMA,not_removed,oh shit rip
MMA,not_removed,right and what would it even prove or supply the movie i kinda think that scene was in slow mo so getting actual knocked out would literally provide nothing
MMA,not_removed,lmao and that my friends is what we call an overreaction the passive aggressive remarks the name calling the cussing and to top it off the layer of im too good for this argument probably the most defensive reply ive read in a long while so congrats on that you really proved that youre calm cool and collected about all this
MMA,not_removed,tenement here in glasgow people really didnt like my joke eh aha
MMA,not_removed,canada too but its a looped end here not a dead end
MMA,not_removed,nothing to do with the timing it was just a shite joke
MMA,not_removed,the fact that you felt you needed to bring that up because hes black is the issue here
MMA,not_removed,yes there is the industry isnt run by proportionate people hollywood doesnt make original films much anymore nothing is appropriating about casting a person of color as a white role in the underrepresentative market
MMA,not_removed,ok
MMA,not_removed,oh sheeeeeeeeeeeitt rip
MMA,not_removed,bellew has said about it interviews with ifltv and the guilt afterwards maybe just a bit of promo but it looks genuine to me there is no way im trawling through tony bellew video interviews for proof mind
MMA,not_removed,no worries mate hes basically saying shes used goods and probably has a cavernous gash but im sure youve sussed that now
MMA,not_removed,think you might be right actually looped end it is think ive heard it used for streets with a dead end though too
MMA,not_removed,no worries im always happy to translate the ridiculous glaswegian tongue
MMA,not_removed,its really not an issue to me the issue to me is that whoever is best for the role should get it regardless of race whether that person is white black yellow purple green i wont watch the movie so it really matters so little to me its actually killing me inside everytime i have to reply to peoples comments on the subject because my lack of caring is so small on who actually plays james bond
MMA,not_removed,i highly doubt it was on purpose but its possible jordan took a real shot that hurt him stunt work and fight choreography is dangerous even for the pros
MMA,not_removed,tldr nicks a fisherman nicks a professional athlete and he doesnt do drugs nicks got some friends and hes a triathlon nick didnt eat breakfast this morning so hes a little bit jittery but he didnt take a seat because hes a stander in nick wants to light a joint the interviewers encourage him stating nicks got the fingers nick is a vegetarianvegan on and off but he doesnt do it becausehes an animal lover but its not like he does it because i think we can assume hes trying to say that he doesnt hate people that arent vegetarian nick finds out the interviewers are fans tuffy is the biggest fan i think and he had one jiu jitsu lesson one time in peru nicks rolling a joint and has been for a little bit nick is special nick does marathons and thats a good thing nick makes connections through smoking weed nick my friend matt he smokes that shit and im walking around all fucking sketched like wtf dude quit smoking that type of weed gotta smokesomethattypeofindica interviewers pull out some trick cards nick says its a mental workout he seems hesitant but agrees nick loves dc but are we starting fights here nick flips through the rest of the question cards that have other fighters names on them but hes being a nice guy today and doesnt want to talk about them they smoke some more weed and make small talk the end nick is an acronym for goat
MMA,not_removed,the interviewers make this interview so damn cringe worthy if youre going to have nick on your show especially when youre smashing dabs dont bring up other fightersask for his opinion on them cause its probably the last thing he would want to talk about
MMA,not_removed,to me it would have been more awkward if he had acted any differently
MMA,not_removed,was more about how the interviewers were acting
MMA,not_removed,ahhh i can agree with that for sure
MMA,not_removed,lmao hahahah
MMA,not_removed,enjoy it for the moment it lasts
MMA,not_removed,the real ufc
MMA,not_removed,my wolf tickets are bought
MMA,not_removed,wow this is a lot better than i thought it was going to be no more of this joe rogan screaming overthetop dramatic trailer music this was quiet and intense
MMA,not_removed,httpiimgurcomegptawhjpg
MMA,not_removed,this was very well done
MMA,not_removed,that was really great
MMA,not_removed,halo wars
MMA,not_removed,at this point if they just booked conor vs diaz every months id watch it every fucking time
MMA,not_removed,oh fucking damn it im excited some of the guys making fan promos like brattmamely are great but fucking hell when the ufc gives a shit about making a good promo they god damn do it
MMA,not_removed,da reel tew hunrad forst roun kay oh i predict deese tings
MMA,not_removed,promo is great and im already sold but all i kept thinking was how good is white buffalo
MMA,not_removed,shits dope
MMA,not_removed,bravo for this one ufc bravo
MMA,not_removed,if mcgregor loses again ill be sad
MMA,not_removed,i still like this user created one better
MMA,not_removed,tight tight tight
MMA,not_removed,goosebumps wake me up august
MMA,not_removed,stop my penis can only get so erect
MMA,not_removed,httpgooglufpwke wtf formatting shit anywho this is a little more upbeat johnny cash was made for this stuff
MMA,not_removed,my body is ready for this fight
MMA,not_removed,underwhelming was far better got me super hyped
MMA,not_removed,maybe im simple but i just love what are you gonna do youll do nothin and the way way conor comes out of the shadows to the king is comin
MMA,not_removed,last two ppvs have been kinda mehtbh
MMA,not_removed,conor lost so the promo is somber as fuck lol
MMA,not_removed,that was dope as fuck theatrical as hell
MMA,not_removed,i said i wouldnt get hyped for this stupid rematch but here i am
MMA,not_removed,im very nervous for this fight i feel like something is going to happen at it will be cancelled
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,nothing beats the last seconds of the hbo mayweather vs pacman at last promodocumentary
MMA,not_removed,holy fuck this got me more hype than i thought it would
MMA,not_removed,how do i put money on diaz
MMA,not_removed,nate diaz got this fight in the bag
MMA,not_removed,all aboard the hype train choochoo
MMA,not_removed,want mcgregor to win but the videos im seeing from nates camp are scaring me a bit
MMA,not_removed,haha so much hype for a fight that only matters to mcgregors pride his greatest achievement hasnt been knocking out aldo in seconds but convincing mma fans that this fight makes any sense
MMA,not_removed,ive seen it and heard it a hundred times but the vision of nate on top and battering mcgregor stace and then mcgregor flips over and nate sinks that choke in and rogan is losing his shit man never fails to give me goosebumps
MMA,not_removed,begs the question of did they make this for and just put it on ice
MMA,not_removed,ufc
MMA,not_removed,i was expecting the classic rogan generic comment like conor mcgregor is one of the greatest pound for pound strikers the ufc has ever seen etc
MMA,not_removed,last seconds its time
MMA,not_removed,yeah and because of that this will appeal to a lot of casual fans i think
MMA,not_removed,i like the videos with anthony bourdain doing the narration
MMA,not_removed,got goosebumps when the chieftains hand was gliding over the rocket in slowmotion
MMA,not_removed,best video to describe what an rts is to a nongamer
MMA,not_removed,yeh
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor takes tainted erectile dysfunction pills unable to fight due a to an erection lasting hours
MMA,not_removed,conor gets injured via artems torso
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor gets shot in a drive by
MMA,not_removed,conors knee popping out again
MMA,not_removed,conor acts like a baby at a faceoffpresser again and actually injures his hand swinging at nate
MMA,not_removed,my favorite is the rousey vs holm promo it still makes me tear up
MMA,not_removed,i think i will be sad if either one of them will lose hoping for a draw
MMA,not_removed,he says that because of the the push hes getting so im going to take that and make it mine nate is a fucking smark
MMA,not_removed,that quote from rogan at is so true i cant ever remember a guy from fringe promotions being so well known with people saying he was the brad pitt character from snatch irl then all that went through the roof after he dropped brimage in his ufc debut on the facebook undercard no less two fights later he was headlining his own fight night
MMA,not_removed,i like how it gives context to the first fight its important for the rematch to understand the nature of how the first one came together
MMA,not_removed,gif
MMA,not_removed,johnny cash is just perfect for every situation
MMA,not_removed,looks like a cheap bmovie trailer with the soundtrack and text
MMA,not_removed,ive preferred the prelims over the main cards
MMA,not_removed,lmao found the music for the trilogy fight httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvthivteotlwm
MMA,not_removed,as a mcgregor fan i sadly have to agree that said i got love for nate too will be bittersweet either way
MMA,not_removed,i think so i cant see mcgregor going for points and thats the only way he has a shot imo diaz is very good at rolling with punches and will get a lot of cosmetic damage but wont get kod if conor is smart and out points him he has a chance but i doubt he will and well see a very similar ending like we did before
MMA,not_removed,firstly whos spinning it to make sense as far as rankings and whatnot goes ufc admitted theyre only doing this because conor is a star whos saved major ppv cards when he didnt have to and one of them resulted in a loss he wants to avenge conor admits hes doing this to avenge a loss most fighters would want the same thing but unfortunately they dont have the same power with the big wigs mcgregor does second who cares this is a fun fight to have we get to see fighters who are exciting in the octagon face each other with full prep and training not only that but we get a crazy good card to go with it calm your nips and enjoy the fight man aldo has his belt and hell get his shot at mcgregor if max is good enough i think he is hell get his eventually too enjoy the fights man were living in a time right now where were seeing some really good stuff happen with the sport let it ride man
MMA,not_removed,theres a decent chance they did that with the jonescormier counterpunch segment kept it on ice between and
MMA,not_removed,they made it for then some shenanigans happened between ufc conor and nate and they cancelled it
MMA,not_removed,there needs to be a classic rogan sub reddit with all his sayings in meme form or videos with epic music and his ramblings
MMA,not_removed,would he be wrong though he beat everyone in his weight class in dominant fashion including jose aldo the great
MMA,not_removed,we got ourselves a fightfightfightfight
MMA,not_removed,make diaz take them too round boner joust
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,link
MMA,not_removed,yeah i really think dana and the ufc hate this fight they dont want conor to lose again that clip where dana says he was obsessed with the rematch makes me think they had no choice it was the only fight hed take im no conor fan but i have all the respect in the world for him for doing this for fighting someone two weight classes above where hes the champ no one else does this its a terrible idea but the guy wants to prove himself how can you not admire that
MMA,not_removed,i think nate will win i also hope nate will win that said considering mcgregors kicks i would think leg and body kicks would be his path to victory as long as he can avoid the takedown
MMA,not_removed,ya never know connor might have the plan to damage nates lead leg get him hurting then string together good combos and catch nate off guard with one i still think nate will win though should be a fun fight
MMA,not_removed,i think its a little dumb they had to make an interim belt cuz connor hasnt been fighting in his weight class still a fun fight to watch and enjoy though
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if they can keep it on ice until when jones comes back
MMA,not_removed,you have a a very underrated reddit comment game
MMA,not_removed,you have a very underrated reddit commenting game
MMA,not_removed,hes not criticizing conor hes criticizing the style of promotion
MMA,not_removed,chad mendes wasnt very dominant in my opinion
MMA,not_removed,thanks for massively enhancing my fanfic
MMA,not_removed,thanks for spoiling my fanfic
MMA,not_removed,thanks for spoiling my fanfic
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,nate technically fights at the time he fought elite competition at he landed in suplex city
MMA,not_removed,its kind of dumb but i get it he asked for it and ufc granted it based on him saving ultra cards he didnt have to ufc has always been good to those who are good to them
MMA,not_removed,thats assuming jon doesnt do something stupid in the year ban period to get himself in more trouble if we know anything about jon jones its that given enough time he can find a way to screw up anything
MMA,not_removed,still tooled him on the feet and knocked him out didnt really sustain much damage on the ground either besides that one elbow
MMA,not_removed,the point is that conor went from a fight at to one at in less than days i doubt many if any have ever made a jump like that on this level
MMA,not_removed,tysonesque in his ability to keep fucking up joe also i thought it was year ban because he had banned substances which is even more time for him to fuck up
MMA,not_removed,sure but it wasnt a dominant fight against a short notice replacement i dont see how you can be considered once of the greatest fighter when u have not defended your belt and also convincingly lost to late notice fighter
MMA,not_removed,connor was lined up to fight at when nate stepped in connor was scheduled to fight rda before rda got injured and nate stepped in
MMA,not_removed,i have a hard time believing jones serves a full suspension biggest star and talent still has tons of fans on his side and the only drawing power you had left after connor gets destroyed and nick and nate bow out i say he gets early release like nick did gets a fine and comes back before years calling it now
MMA,not_removed,i mean it was a weight class above suggests your own weight class i dont think mighty mouse would do very well at either and nate diaz isnt a joke even at short notice
MMA,not_removed,well nicks early release happened before usadaera iirc i doubt theyre gonna give jones any lenience after all the crap hes pulled since i think the ufc is also desperate to prove that theyre still in charge with mcgregors money fight mania and now woodley refusing to fight wonderboy just my opinion though
MMA,not_removed,he is the one who wanted to challenge lightweight and conor is a natural lightweight too he wanted to challenge for the title but couldnt beat the ranking dude no one should ever claimed conor is one of the greatest fighter in history its embarassing when he has not defended his belt once
MMA,not_removed,first of all no one fights at their natural weight class so that point literally makes no sense and second of all i didnt fucking say he was the greatest fighter ever i said hes one of the best strikers in the ufc right now
MMA,not_removed,the original comment was conor is one of the greatest in history and you said can you blame him what i meant by natural weight class is that conor frame and height means he belongs naturally in lightweight most people in lw are about his size
MMA,not_removed,that was great i made a little money on camozzi tonight
MMA,not_removed,i kind of hope its jose vs holloway after holloway went out of his way to call jose out so much
MMA,not_removed,jose aldo to face winner of mcgregson and joey diaz in an interim intercontinental cruiserweight hell in a cell next may
MMA,not_removed,what has pettis done to deserve this shot at all max should just straight up be fighting aldo now conor isnt champ
MMA,not_removed,i need to see aldo putting holloway in his place
MMA,not_removed,remember when he was retiring
MMA,not_removed,looking forward to this i want to see jose do what jose does and crush his way back to a rematch with conor
MMA,not_removed,id love to see jose v holloway then assuming jose wins him v mcgreggor ii maybe jose will be the second fighter to hold two belts simultaneously
MMA,not_removed,im just still pissed that pettis is getting a shot at holloway
MMA,not_removed,in other news water is wet
MMA,not_removed,both are tough match ups for aldo hes have his hands full regardless who wins
MMA,not_removed,if aldo does have one foot out the door or even lacks the motivation to fight anymore like he said i a tad worried a hungry young killer like holloway would deserve all respect because you know max will bring it
MMA,not_removed,i feel like is too low for a match vs dondald trump
MMA,not_removed,you know unless conor decides he wants to cut weight
MMA,not_removed,lol when this summer anthony pettis is the champ after all the mcgregoraldo crap we have had to deal with
MMA,not_removed,either fight would be dope cant wait
MMA,not_removed,only reason id rather see holloway vs aldo is cause max seems hungrier than pettis pettis has not shown a great record his last few fights pettis has declined
MMA,not_removed,i lost respect for aldo after seeing how he handled the loss now i dislike him even more for his reaction of getting the belt back
MMA,not_removed,aldos going to throw the fight
MMA,not_removed,i want jose vs holloway and then after that assuming aldo wins a rematch at with the mcgoat where hopefully conor gets another highlight reel ko
MMA,not_removed,and if he survives that conor will have to end his career once and for all
MMA,not_removed,i can see conor never going back down after this the belt and its credibility were the one thing that couldve convinced him imo also if i was aldo id be pretty pissed off that they literally just handed me my belt back and told me to act as if nothing had happened
MMA,not_removed,max will cure his aldos pussyitis with a punch to the face
MMA,not_removed,with tears in his eyes
MMA,not_removed,agreed but at the same time we came so close to pettisaldo already that i want that fight too
MMA,not_removed,i love max but i really want aldo to put him in his place
MMA,not_removed,i think max beats pettis pettiss boxing is nowhere near maxsand though i expect pettiss body to perform better than it did against olivera i still feel is to hard on him and that will be a factor
MMA,not_removed,i found it funny that holloway got mad at aldo even though it was conorufc holding up the fw division does holloway actually expect aldo to defend the fucking interim belt defending the interim belt does nothing for aldo it only puts him in a more risky situation of missing a conor rematch and beating holloway doesnt mean anything for him
MMA,not_removed,imagine if cain gets the fight and stipe wins hed be on track to having the most impressive hw win streak ever with werdum overeem and velasquez back to back
MMA,not_removed,stipe vs velasquez would be ridiculous
MMA,not_removed,i would be more hype for that card than i was for ufc and ufc
MMA,not_removed,throw anderson silva and weidman on that i want to see a fight both guys coming off back to back losses fun fact andersons last two losses were against current champions and he had his moments in those fights as well just sayin
MMA,not_removed,then conor vs aldo if he were to miraculously defeat holloway or pettis but surprisingly to no ones surprise about two weeks before the second time mcgregor presses his restart button aldo will pull out of the fight with an ingrown hair on his vagina or mrsa or whatever other diseases those nasty ass brazilians get the ufc better strip him of the belt immediately and hand it over to conor
MMA,not_removed,mcgregson and joey diaz easy fight for coner mcgregers joey is way lighter than nate
MMA,not_removed,if pettis beats max and aldo to become the new featherweight champ does that mean the whining about conor getting an unfair titleshot vs aldo because he didnt properly climb the ranks to get it stop
MMA,not_removed,cant wait for you to be wrong
MMA,not_removed,i do i also remember when mcgregor was retiring i guess he needed some extra cheese
MMA,not_removed,oh i member
MMA,not_removed,both him and conor heh
MMA,not_removed,guys i think hes serious he said so no way aldo would lie for leverage
MMA,not_removed,what the hell are you smoking angel dust josie doesnt deserve a shot at the belt ii will be at so josie can spit shine the belt and hand it back to conor then he can unceremoniously ride off into the sunset his career over
MMA,not_removed,i agree with you that i would rather see aldohalloway but i think fw is what pettis needed he lost to some killers in lw and the comes down to fw and choked the shit out of olivera i think we are going to see a rejuvenated showtime from here on out pettishalloway is going to be real good
MMA,not_removed,yeah everybody seems to forget this joker said he was going to throw a fight to get out of his contractwhat a bitch move
MMA,not_removed,then cruz vs conor at cruz becomes double champ mcgregor retires from moves up to heavyeight where he belongs knocks out stipe then knocks out mayweather then fights trump in the wwe before retiring from mma so he can be the potus
MMA,not_removed,the fans wont forget anywhere aldo shows up with that belt he will be greeted with a never ending barrage of boos and thats before conor starts calling him something like jose fraudo and encourages it
MMA,not_removed,maxs chicken legs will be bludgeoned
MMA,not_removed,post rda pettis isnt really the same as the jumpingkickoffthefence pettis it would likely be a one sided fight
MMA,not_removed,im the same way i think aldo would end the holloway hype but i wouldnt mind max proving me wrong either
MMA,not_removed,yes i like watching max fight but his trash talk is cringey i hope aldo beats his ass after all that talk
MMA,not_removed,i think hes just trying to take aldos focus off of mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,i think holloway my decision but people need to remember pettis is a damn finisher at random times any kick sprawl on the ground pettis could catch him at any time holloway needs to be careful those kicks can catch you fast
MMA,not_removed,pettis has excellent kickboxing
MMA,not_removed,he also won the jds fight imo the fact that it was so close is also testament to his skills i think
MMA,not_removed,definitely could happen even if verdum wins i expect the matchup sooner or later
MMA,not_removed,this hurt my brain
MMA,not_removed,thats pure heart vs skill right there joe rogan
MMA,not_removed,im not
MMA,not_removed,everyones retiring
MMA,not_removed,he wasnt lying it was a mistranslation
MMA,not_removed,i gotta disagree man i actually think aldo would love the rematch nothing he has said says the opposite must kill him inside knowing it went down the way it did
MMA,not_removed,how would his shot at be any more or any less than what conor got conor was on a fight win streak and had never fought at before jose would at least have another consecutive win under his belt and setting the stage for a sequel fight makes more sense than randomly giving conor a crack at the lightweight belt if conor went down to for the rematch id be fine with that i would be willing to bet we will never see conor at again though
MMA,not_removed,jeez dude who shit in your corn flakes
MMA,not_removed,on his way to the whitehouse a coked up bones jones runs conor over then goes to jail forever
MMA,not_removed,exactly the downvoters are just in denial
MMA,not_removed,i think aldo finishes both pettis and holloway those leg kicks will be there all night
MMA,not_removed,hes lost a bit of his aggressiveness probably getting his orbital broken did that luckily he didnt get knocked out for his trouble im hoping he can get his head right and show his potential hes still young and downright scary when hes at the top of his game
MMA,not_removed,you spelled usada wrong
MMA,not_removed,i agree pettis can gets up high fast and his body kick is nasty he can very well catch max especially since max is a thin guybut after the round i dont see it being much of a threat
MMA,not_removed,yes he has excellent kickboxing im talking about boxing two very different things pettis uses his hands to set his kicks up max with pure hands exchanges is way better if max presses it will shutdown pettiss kick game you cant setup or kick while moving backwards and staying in the pocket with max pettis will get picked apart this efffect will amplify as the fight goes on as pettis will get tired faster from the cut
MMA,not_removed,i thought he won that one too hope he gets to run it back
MMA,not_removed,but surprisingly to no ones surprise my favourite line
MMA,not_removed,i totally read that in his voice
MMA,not_removed,see you in the flair bet
MMA,not_removed,you better get yo life you mustve sustained some head trauma yourself if you cant remember the past months all that conor has done conor was a two title holder before coming to the ufc he is probably close to being the pound for pound in the world after he killed aldo dead with one punch conor was supposed to fight another bitch brazilian for the strap months ago but he hurted his footsie thats why conor was diverted from defending the same outcome wouldve happened to dos anjos that happen to aldo once that will end his career at round two once and for all anything conor says hell do hell do he just fought times in months he asked for a break until his kid is born and then the ufc pulled this shit aldo has fought six times in the last four years i guarantee conor will make and smash aldo once more if aldo is even willing to take that fight but the more likely route that puss getting hurt again about two weeks before the fight
MMA,not_removed,if pettis couldnt get pass barboza i cant see him offering aldo anything
MMA,not_removed,i agree but i think aldoholloway is much closer and much much more interesting
MMA,not_removed,i mean the two skillsets are related kickboxing isnt just kicks it is boxing as well dont get me wrong i think holloway could very well win but i wouldnt say that either has a clear advantage in terms of striking
MMA,not_removed,if holloway beats pettis and youre kind enough to teach me how that works im game
MMA,not_removed,wait you think him playing it safe during his fights translates into how he picks his opponents do you actually know anything about aldos path before ufc he has faced killers his entire career
MMA,not_removed,playing it safe for years ok im done taking you seriously now
MMA,not_removed,lol dont forget your boner buddy mcgregor lost to mr nate diaz a guy who wasnt even in the top of his weight class and who has double digit losses on his record
MMA,not_removed,id like to see that kicking contest though
MMA,not_removed,aldo also has a takedown game which was absent with barboza
MMA,not_removed,there is a difference between kickboxing and boxing and it is very clear the key is range there is kickboxing range and their is boxing range pettis hands alone are nothing special maxs are pettis doesnt do much damage with his hands they are primarily to setup his kicks hollaway is not gona hang on the outside where he can be kicked all day a kicking specialist can not setup when he his moving backwards or when his opponent steps in deep max will have to implement a game plan where he is in pettises face and press him backward which removes a lot of anthonys options and forces him to fight maxs fight rewatch hollaway vs conor and evaluate maxs hands watch any of pettiss fights you will not see that level exchanging but you will constantly see him setting up his kicks my personal favorite is vs louzon max has a clear advantage with his hands and pettis with his kicks take the cut into effect especially for a round fight i can see max only getting stronger as pettis slows
MMA,not_removed,fridays before ufcs they have flair betting threads where you pick a fighter and a flair for your opponent the person who picks the losing fighter gets the flair their opponent picks
MMA,not_removed,i dont think its a stretch to say aldo has played it safe its kind of similar to how gsp lost his killer instinct over time after the serra loss he had a couple finishes but at the end it was a safe domination
MMA,not_removed,aldo do not take risk and go for the finish anymore the last fight where he actually pushed to kill was against mendes
MMA,not_removed,no denying he lost to nate he fought pounds over his championship weight and that was a terrible match up for mcgregor he had everything to lose and he still showed up and he took that fight with nate on days who else has done that name me three championship caliber fighters who take fights like that not named donald cerrone ill wait tim kennedy hasnt fought since the ufcreebok deal but says hell fight anyone at any weight above and i believe him there i gave you one waiting for two more dos anjos lost to alvarez anderson silvia lost ronda lost matt hughes lost gsp got killed his last fight and shitbag judges gave him the decision and aldo got rebooted everyone loses
MMA,not_removed,this is a neat analysis cheers for the writeup i look forward to watching the match i take it you have holloway winning
MMA,not_removed,yeah tough fight to call mcgregor used a lot of kicks against holloway after recently rewatching that fight pettis is dangerous when he pressures and has the best body and high kick in the game hands down but if holloway pressures him its gonna be a long night i think it goes rounds either way both guys are too good
MMA,not_removed,im not saying that aldo is going to campaign and bend himself backwards to fight conor but do you really think he wouldnt do it if the opportunity presented itself he did want to become a double champion too you know saying all he wanted wants to do is to cry fluke and duck conor is a real disservice to his career so far and thats why i took that tone with you
MMA,not_removed,thanks yes i have max winning with a huge focus on the cut for anthony and it being a fight if his body can perform at like it did at then anything can happen im just not convined of that
MMA,not_removed,i feel like we are talking about different things now on your original comment you made it sound like aldo was terrified of conor and now youre giving me reasons why the rematch wont happen to the point where i agree with everything you said but the third point im not sure that the only thing fueling aldo is belt money the reasons he gave for not taking risks at lightweight so far were mostly about him not wanting to vacate and interrupts his at the time potentially recordbreaking reign at this point in time aldo is already a millionaire and if he is that desperate to cash in mcgregor is the fight to aim for if he really doesnt want this fight i think its more likely that its because he is enamored with the fw belt than that he is afraid of losing to conor again i mean what does he have to lose hardcore fans and his peers already respect him and a sizeable ammount irregular fans either dont know him or think he is a chump its not like losing to mcg again would kill his legacy
MMA,not_removed,losing to mcgregor again would absolutely kill his legacy though right now hes still getting by with the i got caught it wasnt really a fight defense if he gets picked apart like eddie that excuse is over ill say this though aldo would love to get the fight at if he comes up short he can say hes just not a lightweight that the size difference was too much watch him avoid the fight at at all costs
MMA,not_removed,i feel like you are picking and choosing bits to make a pretty ugly analysis of aldos personality and goals out of all that happened with the interim belt fiasco i dont think the loss is what made him sour you say his bitterness was unprecedented but thats only fitting seeing as how the mistreatment of him and his division were also unprecedented and he has always been outspoken about this sort of thing honestly its impossible to know if you are right all i can say is that i find your understanding of aldos motivations to be pretty unfounded
MMA,not_removed,should have touched gloves
MMA,not_removed,it looks like she got fatter after taking the beating lol what the hell
MMA,not_removed,they did
MMA,not_removed,damn she had a mom bod
MMA,not_removed,you know after a trip to chechnya this gsp guy called me up and asked for fighting advice he said you must teach me master and so i did i taught him my patented seagal punch which he then renamed the superman punch it was disrespectful to me as a pure martial artist so then i said to him i said fight me bro and he refused so i stabbed him in the neck sensei
MMA,not_removed,well there goes our chances seeing gsp return
MMA,not_removed,fuck sake i really wanted to see gsp diaz
MMA,not_removed,one championship made soccer kicks illegal starting with their last event i do not know if they still allow grounded knees to the head rizin and deep seem to be the only major promotions with the full japanese rule set one championships christian and angela lee both come from a traditional martial arts background it may be taekwondo instead of karate dejdamrong sor amnuaysirichoke copied and pasted that name was a high level muay thai fighter before coming to one and was their first champion deep has katsunori kikuno fighting on their cards after his ufc release currently he is the most karate based fighter in mma and has a great highlight reel rizins kizaemon saiga is also karate based and he just made his transition from kickboxing to mma his forth fight is september
MMA,not_removed,i think you would enjoy rey docyogen hasnt fought since but was very fun fought at one fc and im pretty sure
MMA,not_removed,loyotas brother chinzo just fought in bellator not as skilled but same style
MMA,not_removed,well damn of course i start watching now thanks for the info edit kizaemon saigas style is fucking beautiful and so is he lol looking forward to staying up really late for the next rizin
MMA,not_removed,bah cod this loyota
MMA,not_removed,i dont know what youre saying im assuming its something to do with the misspelling of lyoto
MMA,not_removed,im more worried about girlrilla
MMA,not_removed,i was going to ask what country she was from assuming it was mistranslated but then it said usa now i kinda want to know that story
MMA,not_removed,sounds like a name used in anime
MMA,not_removed,im more upset with her friends and the fact that they would allow her to choose this horrid nickname
MMA,not_removed,not as bad as didnt land aelbow queen
MMA,not_removed,somebodys bored
MMA,not_removed,haha so funny xd
MMA,not_removed,lol thats hilarious
MMA,not_removed,not the original cameraman
MMA,not_removed,nick looks huge compared to eddie
MMA,not_removed,holy shit that size difference is crazy
MMA,not_removed,used to train at a gym nick coached at and hes a pretty cool guy a true veteran of the sport and had some cool stories to tell i remember him telling me once in class that his jab was his best punch and that he knocked out eddie alvarez with it tbh at the time i didnt even know he fought alvarez went home later and looked it up
MMA,not_removed,that guy looks like he put on and inches after weighins quality rehydration
MMA,not_removed,eddie is tough dude with alot of heart but hard to seeing him beating rda when he has looked like a monster recently
MMA,not_removed,fun fact nick quit fighting to be a lawyer
MMA,not_removed,the true goat
MMA,not_removed,gotta love bodog fights a guy with a shit ton of money decides he wants an mma promotion and makes it happen
MMA,not_removed,wow nick is huge compared to eddie this is a fight were you can really see the lack of weight classes in mma and how it can play a big factor on the regional circuit as eddie being a small lw and thompson a former middleweight
MMA,not_removed,thompson look like in the fight
MMA,not_removed,fun fact nick got drunk as a skunk on the flight home and mocked alvarezs kid on the way home pulled a tony ferguson
MMA,not_removed,i watched this fight on ppv and i remember being really suprised that eddie got dominated like that weight classes are real
MMA,not_removed,am i the only one who doesnt want to see this guy as champ
MMA,not_removed,thats cause he is huge compared to eddie
MMA,not_removed,its just the angle
MMA,not_removed,that was a good fight never seen it before this thanks for posting
MMA,not_removed,i dont wanna see nick thompson as champ either
MMA,not_removed,if he earns it why not this isnt wwe
MMA,not_removed,i really dont care if he earned it and wins it doesnt matter
MMA,not_removed,why
MMA,not_removed,why tho at least he aint some roid monkey like that other guy from diazs team
MMA,not_removed,gsp mike pyle gym megan olivi youtube account
MMA,not_removed,lol sorry i didnt clarify i meant eddie alvarez im sure u knew that tho haha
MMA,not_removed,im just not a fan i didnt say he cant i just like rda better i like khabib cerron diaz would even rather see ferguson dont really know why it got downvoted just not a fan of him or his style
MMA,not_removed,but youd lose your shit if the lights went dark and the first thing you see is anthony pettis running across the cage and he showtime kicks rda and alvarez and exits the arena then right before hes gone turns to face the audience and throws up double fingers theme song tbd
MMA,not_removed,trany you are without a doubt the owner of that olivi youtube account
MMA,not_removed,lol hahaha
MMA,not_removed,do you like his preufc fights or the cerrine one
MMA,not_removed,i wish just a uuge fan nam phan
MMA,not_removed,cerrone
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,itll be cody i guarantee it actually i dont but its just my hunch with how shit has been workin lately
MMA,not_removed,would be nice if tjs fans were large enough to spam danas social media aside from aldo tj is getting hosed the worst in terms of deserved shitletots
MMA,not_removed,it should be dillashaw
MMA,not_removed,plot twist its actually mighty mouse
MMA,not_removed,dana lies so much i dont even believe this at this point
MMA,not_removed,what should happen imo is cruzdillashaw ii with garbrandtcaraway on the same card to sort out the pecking order definitively with that being said its probably going to cody
MMA,not_removed,i honestly wouldnt mind dillashaw vs garbrandt at for the title shot if nothing comes of the next cruz fight soon
MMA,not_removed,better be dillashaw they cant regularly pump out bispinghenderson and conoralvarez fights they need to put on a semblance of respecting the contender and ranking system dont go full circus
MMA,not_removed,tj deserves it
MMA,not_removed,should be tj i dont like him but he is second best guy cody has to beat a top guy first mizugaki and almeida shouldnt earn you a titleshot when tj just beat beat assuncao
MMA,not_removed,cody even getting a shot is more evidence that rankings dont matter and never have or will
MMA,not_removed,it should be tj
MMA,not_removed,he needs to put a poll up on twitter and whoever gets the most votes is the one who fights cruz since he wants to do what the fans want and fuck contenders lol
MMA,not_removed,dana is starting to look more and more like homer simpson these days
MMA,not_removed,i still want to see cody fight someone else before he fights cruz the winner of linkere vs dodson for a title elimination fight or a fight agaisnt rivera would better imo
MMA,not_removed,well we knew that much
MMA,not_removed,is there a good fight for cody if dillashaw gets cruz or would he just be in limbo
MMA,not_removed,well yes
MMA,not_removed,can someone find me a way to download that thumbnail
MMA,not_removed,he also told us water is wet
MMA,not_removed,imo if i was tj id prefer cody gets the shot if cruz wins then tj is next in line but if cody wins i think cody vs tj is a bigger fight and worth even more money new champ defending the belt against former team mate etc plus if cody kos cruz he could be a pretty big draw
MMA,not_removed,personally id like to see garbrandt vs dillashaw then the winner gets to fight cruz
MMA,not_removed,what more does tj have to do after beats like i love cody but i dont feel comfortable skipping tj
MMA,not_removed,dillashaw deserves the fight but galbrant has been built up so i think hell get the shot put tj faber on the under card which uriah still has some value as an opponent
MMA,not_removed,obviously dana tell us something we dont know you fuckin goooof
MMA,not_removed,dammit id rather see the snake vs the tattoo
MMA,not_removed,was anyone thinking anything other than those
MMA,not_removed,merit vs money i think we all know who wins in todays ufc
MMA,not_removed,so one of these thanks for the clarification thought it was gonna be mizugaki or faber to be honest
MMA,not_removed,cruz vs tj garbrandt vs winner of linekerdodson
MMA,not_removed,we knew this
MMA,not_removed,garbrandt should fight dodson
MMA,not_removed,does no one else want tj v mighty mouse for the flyweight title
MMA,not_removed,if cody wins ufc should give faber a title shot for the lulz of it
MMA,not_removed,who would have thought
MMA,not_removed,tj deserves it but doesnt sell well and has a really good chance of beating cruz garbrandt sells better does not really deserve it as much as tj and really only has a punchers chance
MMA,not_removed,okay so neither dillashaw or garbrandt are fighting cruz next confirmed you know since everything dana says as of late is opposite of true
MMA,not_removed,garbrandt would be my choice
MMA,not_removed,with the way things are goingitll be garbrandt hell be able to sell the fight much better than tj they really should just do tjfaber in the mean timedoes it make sense no either does hendersonbisping
MMA,not_removed,i think tj can finish both of them and if he doesnt get the shot now he absolutely will get the next one
MMA,not_removed,tj deserves his shot let cody fight guy first caraway or assuncao
MMA,not_removed,it will be dodson
MMA,not_removed,which means that neither will and cruz will fight cyborg in the first intergender title fight
MMA,not_removed,why even do this to tj it seems cruel he is one of a few excellent fighters without a star level fan base that gets used as nothing more than a negotiating tactic for who the fight is actually going to take what is on the table dont make me give this fight to the person who deserves it
MMA,not_removed,at croke park
MMA,not_removed,yeah and then conor will refuse to defend it and retain that title along with the hw lhw mw ww lw fw bw and flyweight titles while the ufc makes the interim belt for those titles the only achievable belt for other fighters
MMA,not_removed,as much as i respect mcgregor the best thing that came out of him losing to nate diaz was people stop talking about how he could possibly be the welterweight champ it really was getting out of hand at one point so im glad to see that its been reduced to fw and lw
MMA,not_removed,dans
MMA,not_removed,that didnt help khabib get the title shot
MMA,not_removed,it should be but i would love to watch cody no love get embarrassed out of the division by cruz then go rematch tj
MMA,not_removed,cruz beat him
MMA,not_removed,cant wait for linekercruz
MMA,not_removed,the last lie i ever believed from dana was that ufc was gonna be awesome sidenote how did nobody pull the ordered steak got a salad on twatter like the fagtitas did
MMA,not_removed,i hope its cody and then dillashaw
MMA,not_removed,i dont understand why more people arent saying this if you have contenders make them fight for the shot the problem solves itself
MMA,not_removed,ya never go full circus
MMA,not_removed,that ship already sailed
MMA,not_removed,when did deserving it guarantee anything
MMA,not_removed,cruz beat him
MMA,not_removed,thank you the ufc trivialized fighter rankings years ago by changing them suddely to make an underdog seem like a contender
MMA,not_removed,thats not half as bad as it sounds guarantee im the minority here dana tj the fans have spoken you dont matter
MMA,not_removed,is there really a bad fight for cody anywhere in the rankings
MMA,not_removed,stupid clumsy euphemisms
MMA,not_removed,watch uriah win a udsd and fuck up those plans lol
MMA,not_removed,the winner of liniker dodson maybe
MMA,not_removed,well tj most recently beat the ranked fighter in the division so i would say he has merit
MMA,not_removed,the ufc has always chosen money theyre all about that short buck
MMA,not_removed,i still dont see how cody is a money fight i feel like the average mma fan still doesnt even really know who he is tj is probably more well known because hes been around the ufc longer and was champion before
MMA,not_removed,lets compare a garbrandt title shot to a hendo title shot hendo is a legendary mma fighter with the best resume of wins in the sport and is the only man to win belts in two weight classes at the same time while cody has had fights and his best win is an old mizugaki its hard to compare them
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,she naturally ends up becoming the first person to find cruz chin
MMA,not_removed,so they have headlines when tj goes off on secondratewtfsportzcom
MMA,not_removed,they dont give shit about fighters
MMA,not_removed,i dont understand why we hear more of tj complaining than we hear of tj taking fights he could make a case for a title shot and earn money by fighting and winning against contenders garbrandt has the same number of ufc wins as tj when he got his first title shot and arguably garbrandt did it against tougher competition and has looked more impressive
MMA,not_removed,with sinead oconnor as referee
MMA,not_removed,you forgot the womens belts
MMA,not_removed,love that
MMA,not_removed,lets see if lack of trt turns the hbomb into a hparty popper
MMA,not_removed,if a superfight between conor dom was on the books i wouldnt mind putting cody and tj on the backburner champ vs champ superfights should take precedence over all jon jones vs stipe jbj vs rumble
MMA,not_removed,khabib doesnt deserve a titleshot though
MMA,not_removed,wouldnt mind dillashaw getting his shot and then cody beating someone actually in the top or so first a one way titleeliminator of sorts probably wont happen though theyll give cody his shot if he loses they can fall back on tj and still give cody his chance at a second shot by building him up and saying he wasnt ready the first time around
MMA,not_removed,im more curious to see how cruz can fare with dillashaw a second time around cruz is actually one of the favorite fighters and his intensity is on another level but if he can beat him a second time ill be so impressed
MMA,not_removed,a choice i believe is perfect is cruz vs tj with tj winning then tj vs cody tj vs cody is a better fight than cruz vs cody imo
MMA,not_removed,it was so so close though i think tj is the number one contendor so thats why
MMA,not_removed,so dillashaw shouldnt get a rematch because he lost you didnt really give much of a reason was the fight too recent do you think dillashaw needs more time etc
MMA,not_removed,in fairness ufc wouldve been much more memorable had jon jones not done a jon jones
MMA,not_removed,he said he deserves a title shot no he does not lol
MMA,not_removed,honestly me too im not saying cody is rumble but hes closer to that than tj is so hes got dat punchers chance sadly the rankings have already been bastardized a long time ago by the ufc by artificially raising fighter ranks before fights to make it seem more interesting
MMA,not_removed,i think why people arent saying this is because tj just beat assuncao who was while garbrandt beat mizugaki who was or something garbrandt is still ranked so while frankie vs aldo makes sense as a title eliminator because they are tj vs cody doesnt make sense because cody isnt any more of a contender than the five guys ranked above him its not shitting on cody thats just the logic that being said he has some hype behind him and if they want to give him a shot regardless of rank they will but a tj vs cody now would just fuck with future fights by adding a loss to one of their records and eliminating their ability to ask for the title next
MMA,not_removed,because it will take way too long a cruz title defense now is better than later especially with his injury history
MMA,not_removed,its because tj already beat the closest contender in assuncao cody havent beaten any top guy
MMA,not_removed,well i think some people myself included dont consider garbrandt a legitimate contender yet
MMA,not_removed,other than chael conor and bisping nothing else too egregious imo but i think theyre on the brink right now and if they matched tj with cruz that would send the ufc over the edge they need to show that conor et al are anomalies and not the norm
MMA,not_removed,nate beat conor why the hell did conor get a rematch
MMA,not_removed,why do you keep posting this response im not really a fan of dillashaw but just saying cruz beat him over and over doesnt make your point valid
MMA,not_removed,i guess in your world rematches shouldnt exist
MMA,not_removed,barely
MMA,not_removed,nah for years the ufc was mostly good about matching up fights based on merit things have changed since the era of chael and mcgregor the belt doesnt mean what it used to just or years ago
MMA,not_removed,tj is the contender cody is much lower ranked yet has a string of kos good mma press and self promotion it should be obvious that tj is next in line but something is moving cody to the front of the line that something is a potential money
MMA,not_removed,if cruz and cody fight i would really like to see tj against someone else in the division in the meantime if he gets passed over that sucks but he needs to keep active until theres no other choice to make except him make them have to pick you
MMA,not_removed,tj just beat the ranked bw very decisively in all honesty who else poses a challenge to him besides cruz
MMA,not_removed,there is the issue of tjs shitty nontitle contract he wont make much money taking other fights
MMA,not_removed,and big sam in mcgregors corner
MMA,not_removed,lack of trt and his age will put him in the same spot bisping was in against rockhold albeit better odds than my instincts told me to bet on bisping and it worked out so im trusting my gut and going with henderson via slightly less impressive ko than expected in round
MMA,not_removed,a rematch with tj is his most competitive fight at would be impressive if he won a time i think hes gotten even better since the first time they fought
MMA,not_removed,i would like to see cruz fight garbrant before dillishaw dillishaw may be the number contender but we just saw that fight and in my mind cruz only has a limited time on his career left for that reason id like to see him against as many people as we can but if you wanna know whos really the best youd have to run it back with tj
MMA,not_removed,its the new conor fans that showed up that think shit like this he said aldo doesnt deserve a shot so now everyone thinks that people who lose dont deserve rematches even though theyve only been around for like conor fights and was a rematch
MMA,not_removed,and you dont want contenders to keep knocking eachother off the ladder either
MMA,not_removed,yeah but he can ko people so the sheeple have voted he is the new black tj can ko people too of course but cody has more flare therefor he matters more hateth thou player not thy game dana white
MMA,not_removed,artificially raising fighters rankings to make fights more plausible remember siver got that sudden boost pre conor that happens a lot the ufc themselves turned fighter rank into a scam years ago i wish it didnt play out that way but they did it for the short money
MMA,not_removed,because tj isnt worth as much sad but true lets not suddenly pretend ufc rankings mean something theyre the ones who made them worthless
MMA,not_removed,money
MMA,not_removed,butcruz beat him
MMA,not_removed,thats exactly it if you dont move the needle for the ufc financially you beat people until there is nobody left but the title holder winning gets you a title shot just not necessarily on your preferred schedule
MMA,not_removed,we dont know because hes only fought barao who hasnt looked good since soto who and assuncao who spent nearly full years out on an ankle injury that kept him out of training if cruz fights tj next well still have no idea where either ranks against actual active rising contenders in the division because neither cruz nor tj will have fought one in or for that matter neither will the other fighters theyve fought in defenses
MMA,not_removed,your instincts said bet against the grain son clearly bisping by in round
MMA,not_removed,he fought once since then against a rapidly declining faber it maybe a bit soon for all that
MMA,not_removed,definitely agree hes been pushing it more and he may not like it but hes shaken off some of that ferric oxide i think he may more convincingly beat tj the second time he just has to remember to be smart and not catch a desperate haymaker from tj if cruz stays in the pocket too long hes also gotta watch the leg kicks big time
MMA,not_removed,interestingly enough i checked his profile and you were right hes a big conor fan and hasnt been watching mma for very long at all it appears
MMA,not_removed,how would they knock each other off winner gets the title shot
MMA,not_removed,why are you typing that
MMA,not_removed,so tj just going to follow faber tactics thenonce again tj under fabers wing fighting randoms till they give him a shot again
MMA,not_removed,the leg kicks were the worst a few more of those from tj and hed still be the champion the fight wad that close
MMA,not_removed,man i keep saying it conor fans like that really make all of us look bad
MMA,not_removed,i was talking about it as a general thing if you have strong contenders climbing the ladder it is usually better to keep them on separate paths to the title shot to have more interesting options for the champ to defend against
MMA,not_removed,i mean if tj is a full time fighter why wouldnt he take fights he only gets paid when he fights and all top level fighters have a competitive fire he should want to test himself against other fighters in the division tj got his first title shot after wins and losses in the ufc at bw he hadnt beaten a top fighter in the division or any other division when he got his title shot now he demands a title shot after one win in the meantime you have rivera on a fight ufc win streak and looking impressive lineker on a fight ufc win streak over solid competition garbrandt on a fight ufc win streak and undefeated dodsons only lost in the past years to dj and gave the king his toughest challenge and smashed tj lets see tj fight some of these active contenders and lets see the active contenders fight each other
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah cruzs leg couldnt take much more of that foot i think this time cruz will be more careful and potentially more dominant if theres one thing about cruz even his haters can admit its that he comes smart hes as methodical as a serial killer when it comes to movement if tj happens to drop his guard after kicking with his lead leg cruz will try and create that scenario so he can land his shot
MMA,not_removed,melvin guillard really changed since i last saw him
MMA,not_removed,common were better than this
MMA,not_removed,dumbest shit ive ever read lol
MMA,not_removed,thats not melvin guillard and i wouldnt call james toney a mma personality
MMA,not_removed,yeah their probably just jerks to person who wrote this bullshit article
MMA,not_removed,conor is like half the size woodley is pls never come back
MMA,not_removed,if my aunt had a dick shed be my uncle
MMA,not_removed,conors left is arguably harder than woodleys right are you kidding conors left is like a rock hitting your face woodleys right is like a lunchbox full of rocks hitting you in the face
MMA,not_removed,lawler doesnt have to worry about conors wrestling
MMA,not_removed,oh boyhere we go
MMA,not_removed,please never post here again
MMA,not_removed,first of all connors left is definitely not stronger than woodley right
MMA,not_removed,come on mcgregors got heavy hands for a fw but dont fucking compare him to woodley
MMA,not_removed,you cant be serious
MMA,not_removed,why dont mods ban people like this the sub is ruined with them but no just a deleted comment and thats it
MMA,not_removed,go think about it some more the truthll settle in
MMA,not_removed,obvious troll is obvious
MMA,not_removed,sry dude woodley is a different type of athlete and he is propably just as quick as conor so chill out
MMA,not_removed,tremendous shitpost also no spoiler tag so enjoy getting taken down in tminus
MMA,not_removed,conor is with a inch reach same as woodley
MMA,not_removed,woodley hits like a wrecking ball
MMA,not_removed,you knew it was comin
MMA,not_removed,every welterweight has harder punching power than mcgregor nonetheless the power punchers
MMA,not_removed,you do realize woodley is also like pounds heavier right
MMA,not_removed,conor doesnt cut much weight if any at all woodley cuts is my guess
MMA,not_removed,you know size is more than height and reach right
MMA,not_removed,im not making that argumentof course all welterweights hit harder than someone pounds smaller
MMA,not_removed,oh im agreeing with you my response was more building on what you said directed at op
MMA,not_removed,gotcha its ridicolous the confidence some people have in mcgregor weight classes are there for a reason
MMA,not_removed,i mean when ya think about it just look what bisping did to rockhold if his pillowhands can put him down imagine what mcgregor would do
MMA,not_removed,exactly some people are just delusional i remember comments in this sub talking about mcgregor fighting for the mw belt after beating rda and then lawler unbelievable
MMA,not_removed,sure you are punching into his gloves constantly almost like you are treating him like a pad holder break that habit you seem to be focused on volume rather than shot selection timing or footwork pick up on his patterns sparring should be mostly mental training where you get to experiment with tactics if someone balls up like that when you throw a punch that opens up an opportunity for a combo that starts with a punch and ends with anything you want to their body because they are not prepared to block it then finish with a jab as you back up because from the looks of it he will undoubtedly try to retaliate with power be ready to check a kick it seems like he is pretty much letting you punch into his gloves and then he is throwing a hard attack after you are done your balance is often off because you are reaching for shots rather than using proper footwork to move your body toward the target bend your knees more so you can move more easily reset your stance to neutral more quickly when your balance gets better you will get better at offbalancing him that makes him less dangerous and more vulnerable some of your head movement is good i liked the question mark kick we always called it a changeup kick you could land that if you use it in a combination or set it up kick to his body a few times until he starts to react by dropping his hands or reaching for your kick to catch it then change up the next kick to his head try to change your angle of attack more often attack then step off to the side and attack again then push him and back up before he tries to thunder hulk you
MMA,not_removed,sweep the leg johnny
MMA,not_removed,body shots and leg kicks are wide open when he shells up and drops his weight
MMA,not_removed,this guy youre sparring is a douchebag hes throwing at least while youre clearly doing on your shots dont spar with douchebags rule clowns like this hurt people my biggest advice though is fighting trained fighters is a tactical chess match the whole point is pattern recognition and identifying weaknesses throw feints and see which way he leans how he covers up if he has good defensive boxing like he does either go to the body of counter punch with this guy specifically i would counter fight him no point throwing if all youre gonna hit is arm and glove get his timing down and counter him youre more athletically skilled youd fucking clown this guy if you counter fought him
MMA,not_removed,theres already alot of info posted in here but in addition your partner looks like hes throwing some punches at whereas you look like youre throwing more towards if even dont be afraid to hit a little harder and in turn to ask him to tone it down with some of his shots whatever youre comfortable with
MMA,not_removed,simple on from me your right hand doesnt travel back to your chin in a straight line you have a tendency to throw it out and bring it back in a low loop try and snap it back faster than you send it so you arent open to a big counter left hook
MMA,not_removed,the guy you were sparring with is an asshole theres no other way to look at it youre intentionally hitting gloves at power and obviously new to sparring and in general it looks like you are new to full contact anything outside of learning some techniques to not die out there hes going full power audible grunting and not trying to give you looks hes trying to knock you out this is pathetic to see from a training partner you all are there to better each other enhance skills etc you are not there to get hospitalized this is one of the biggest recipes of disaster injury ive ever seen i saw it happen in wrestling a lot over the years and thats not something involving getting hit in the head please either find someone new to spar with a new gym have a conversation with the guy or your coach maybe but stop doing what youre doing i know you want to beat his ass but sparring at this level will seriously hurt you bad edit last seconds or so he wasnt going so hard probably lack of cardio more than getting a clue i still stand by what i said
MMA,not_removed,you should hire a movement coach
MMA,not_removed,focus more on controlling distance youre standing so close to him when youre just punching his guard he is able to catch you with hooks to the body teeps front kicks and side kicks will be youre best friend focus on using a stick and move strategy especially with guys who like to turtle and throw bombs which he seems to stick to you do this more towards the end and those are youre best moments nice question mark kick btw but yeah control distance get in and out quicker and kick the shit outta him good luck dude
MMA,not_removed,question mark kick at the end there was nice homey
MMA,not_removed,youre scared of hurting him because he will probably try to knock you out if you do thats why youre punching into his gloves should probably spar with someone not trying to ko you
MMA,not_removed,wheres edmund when we need him uedmundtarverdyan
MMA,not_removed,move cut an angle when you are ending a flurry circle better yet get him to turtle up with a few light shots circle away from his power and hit him while he turns to face you again you can also stand to vary it up a bit more
MMA,not_removed,kick to the legs and body when he covers up since youre going light hes gonna try to catch your foot hit him with a same side hook and then clinch
MMA,not_removed,use your jab more measure the distance and set up shots go highlow lowhigh and viceversa move around more
MMA,not_removed,since theres already some pretty good offense advice i thought id focus on defense pivot when your getting backed up against the wall to avoid getting bombed on circle away from his power hand this way you can potentially catch your opponent while there turning to face you use your kicks to dictate range after watching your other video it seems like you already know how to do this i guess you werent thinking straight after catching a couple of those right hooks finally these are some good things i saw head movement just do more of it footwork not bad but keep at it hand speed sea level cain potential youve got an interesting style hope you keep posting videos
MMA,not_removed,three things will improve your game massively patience calmness enjoy it take your time throw what feels right dont think about what youre going to throw next punch from the hip kick from the shoulder keep on toes otherwise youre doing ok keep it up dont get discouraged never put yourself down
MMA,not_removed,hands and feet you couldve ended your hand combinations with a nice kick to the body leg or even the head if you so desired as your opponent was just keeping his guard up from your punches if hes doing that often like he is in the video you can program him if he balls up every time you go in for a chain fake your punch angle out then strike attack from angles that allow you to hit open targets also like some other guys have said here dont be afraid to hit harder your opponent was throwing some heavy shots and you were going around or less
MMA,not_removed,to me it just looks like you both agree to fucking stand and bang and not try to dodgeevade any shots put more head movement in there for christs sakes dart in and out change your patterns cause people can catch on
MMA,not_removed,where are you
MMA,not_removed,leg kicks inside outside teep switch kick round house try different combos isnt going to work times in a row
MMA,not_removed,i dont train so ill just ask a question is there a reason that you sometimes close distance and then elect not to fire shots isnt that just walking you into a potential clinchsweep
MMA,not_removed,i know who you are mister get back to streaming rust coconut
MMA,not_removed,saw some good combos in there and that kick at the end was clean keep it up
MMA,not_removed,wow didnt expect all of this awesome feedback thank you so much guys
MMA,not_removed,unless you guys agreed on going hard i suggest finding a different sparring partner eventually he will knock you out and youll be concussed for absolutely no reason youre pretty young so you shouldnt put yourself in that kind of danger while your brain is still developing
MMA,not_removed,stop hitting his gloves try to hurt him
MMA,not_removed,yeah wear headgear if somebody is going to go that hard
MMA,not_removed,after you finish punching in to his gloves you seem to stand there and let him hit you back while you cover up make him miss with footwork instead of trying to absorb the shots with your arms and gloves
MMA,not_removed,you literally stand in front of him and let him wind up and hit you while you stand there two steps back to steps left or right as soon as your done throwing feed him bait jabs to get his hands up and punt the inside leg and repeat when he covers up throw and uppercut through the middle to split his hands when he swings at you get out of the way you stand there and holds pads in front of your face throw singles and doubles and headkicks you literally repeat the same slow af boxersize stuff
MMA,not_removed,fake jab then hook to the body maybe you throw like to his head in a row all while his hands are up hook the body and give him a reason to block low to open up his head the basic combo is body body head or head body head mix it up the kick at the end was beautiful though source i got boxed up a lot
MMA,not_removed,when he puts his high guard up dont waste energy throwing hard shots at his gloves you can tap his gloves with light punches and finish off with hard shots to the body but make sure your head is off centre when you throw hooks to the body to open up your hips and generate more power but most importantly to avoid his counters easier said than done a lot of people who have never sparred before will give advice but in reality they themselves wouldnt be able to implement it you are doing good man keep up the hard work
MMA,not_removed,okay first off u are doing great i can see that u really wanna improve and u have the balls to post your sparring here which of the internet trolls whouldnt second your sparringpartner is a douchebag he is obviously going at with his punches sometimes many guysgirls already said some good things i think u could use your reach better extend your jab more and get a better distance control with your jab and frontside kicks try to start your combos with some punches to the head then finish with a body shot or a kick to the body he will most likely keep his guard very high when u go for punches to the head so his body will be open and try to jab a little bit more often so u keep him busy and it wont coast u much power u will improve every time so just keep up the good work
MMA,not_removed,find new guys in the gym and tell them you only want to spar very lightly then absolutely beat the shit out of them when someone steps in tell them it was just a prank bro
MMA,not_removed,months of sprawl training and youd be a beast
MMA,not_removed,straight up find a new gym and stop sparring your no where near advanced enough for contact sparring without a headgear protect your brain this is going to be hard to hear but you dont have a killer instinct i call it the i have a great life good job or hes a nice guy mentality you dont want to hurt the other guy or want to be hurt because in the back of your head everything is ok ill go home and life is simple your training throwing punches and low power shots to train the other guy is throwing to hit you need to find a good gym with a trainer that isnt afraid to tell you not to spar secondly someone who isnt afraid to say hey douchnozzel stop hitting the new guy so hard your training partner was not helping you in any way he is the heavy handed ass who is not helping you by dropping heavy shots on you
MMA,not_removed,pro tip dont get your ass kicked
MMA,not_removed,this guy basically sums up everything but to put it into a concise idea be dynamic and respond to your opponent hes covering up as soon as it looks like youre throwing a shot sometimes before you even do it when you see that respond take advantage and aim for his open spots front kick to the body cut an angle to the left and body shot him throw a feint and follow up with a body shot when he turtles then attack the head when he reacts to the body shot dont mimic your opponent you guarded up seconds before he did anything and he took advantage respond to his attacks respond to his defence fighting isnt i throw punch a you use block b its a dance with rhythm and motion and you win by catching your opponent offbeat as for movement here is a good video by marvin cook explaining hitting while moving and positioning yourself for attacks use your defence movement to set up your offence
MMA,not_removed,great points id also add that his opponent is loading up on shots while op is just standing around after his combination is done if a guy is looking for the big counter the best response is to not be there move after the combination is over and not in a predictable fashion
MMA,not_removed,exactly once op launches his partner turtles and waits to counter op needs to learn head body head and the good old slip n rip or just be a devil to the abdomen his partner didnt seem to mind serving up ribs
MMA,not_removed,great point also work on pivoting and attacking from more angles you seem to just move forwards and backwards this isnt fencing throw a light flurry or fake jabs at his face to make him cover up or obstruct his vision and pivot to the side of him and you could hurt him throw more feints too y that question mark kick would have worked the guy reacts straight away to where he thinks youll throw good luck
MMA,not_removed,i cant agree more the guy was audible grunting to try to get extra power into his shots in sparring typical gym bully and needs his head teed off on if hes going to act like a prick
MMA,not_removed,i have come across guys who spare too hard they were a terror when i was first starting out everyone says just call for a break but lets be real no one likes to seem like a pussy ill say try to avoid those hard hitters most of the time but spar with them occasionally and learn to deal w them asap once you have went afew rounds with a guy more experienced than you that is trying to knock your head off but you survive it will take your game to a new level i dont advocate routine hard sparring but honestly if you wanna get any good you might just have to take some shots while you are learning know when to say no though if the guy is a douche and is way bigger than you
MMA,not_removed,there were some shots that were definitely power the guy was even grunting when throwing i agree that it looks like op is going rough thats a recipe for injury if ive ever seen one
MMA,not_removed,i came here to say this every time you throw get used to having your opposite hand glued to your face while you throw as dannytsg said make sure your hand is coming straight back to your chin after you have punched too
MMA,not_removed,get nice and flowy
MMA,not_removed,after all the comments you need to confirm you are black guy right
MMA,not_removed,i think thats probably why he is asking for tips asshole
MMA,not_removed,nah for real though you waste a lot of effort trying to break his shell youre not going to punch through his gloves youre fast on your feet jab jab when he covers up boop right down the centre with an uppercut and stop backing away with your hands down near your chest either put a frame out or cover up
MMA,not_removed,cut an angle to his right plant a right hand on his left ear or body shot and keep moving behind him dont cut an angle left youll be moving into his right hand can also get an uppercut inbetween those arms
MMA,not_removed,yeah i do agree with you was being kind and there were definitely moments of what looked like him pulling the trigger full throttle sad to see in such an environment and a coach would do well to pull him aside and have a word
MMA,not_removed,be first
MMA,not_removed,also youve clearly done some tkd or something before sidekicks are your friend same with teeps to the body
MMA,not_removed,this is lorenz hes verified with me have fun rmma and special thanks to ugoinghamandcheese for getting him on here edit thanks again for stopping by lorenz

MMA,not_removed,lorenz thoughts on potentially linking back up with scott under the strikeforce banner they really saw a real talent in you and pushed you well for sure at the time the merger took place alot of fans were salivating at the match ups possible coming into the ufc
MMA,not_removed,are you glad your virtual ea counterpart was buffed
MMA,not_removed,who designs your hair you or your barber or is it more of a collaborative effort
MMA,not_removed,lorenz mofuckin larkin you are an inspiring man to watch fight what is your regimen like on a weekly basis
MMA,not_removed,get paid dude
MMA,not_removed,hey lorenz how did you feel in your first fight at against john howard
MMA,not_removed,i know youre not supposed to talk about what happens in the gym but having bisping as a sparring partner must be intense and demanding how do those training sessions go and who gets the better of the exchanges i know he has cardio for days and is technically very proficient but i feel like youre technically on another level with your stand up was it like a wanderleiwerdum situation where he faced a steep learning curve with you and has caught up or vice versa also huge fan thanks for doing this ama
MMA,not_removed,good luck with your negotiations as a fan i hope youre able to work it out with the ufc youre a top level talent who deserves to fight top level competition in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,whats up lorenz who is your favorite fighter to watch and whats your favourite performance by said fighter

MMA,not_removed,yo whats up
MMA,not_removed,hi lorenz who is the scariest fighter on the ufc roster any weightclass not including conor or full size nate diaz
MMA,not_removed,congrats on the last fight definitely deserve that new contract thats coming for you
MMA,not_removed,just a singular fans perspective right here i do want you sign with the place that will offer you the most money ive been watching your fights since strikeforce challengers instead of signing with just bellator i would like to see you sign a joint deal with bellatorrizin you with soccer kicks and fighting in a ring would create very exciting fights
MMA,not_removed,if you transition out of the ufc as a fan id like to see you in bellator against the likes of rory mcdonald douglas lima andrey koreshkov and ben henderson if you were to choose somewhere else like wsof or rizin i could see less appealing fights with jake shields jon fitch or ben askren
MMA,not_removed,if the ufc doesnt give you big money and a title shot its bull shit
MMA,not_removed,your dismantling of magny was incredible whod you like to face first if your negotiations with bellator do pull through also if you watched woodleythompson whod you have winning
MMA,not_removed,favourite event youve watched

MMA,not_removed,big fan mate your performance against magny was incredible how do you feel physically at compared to is it a tough cut and how do you feel about water weight cutting in the ufc compared to one championship for example where dehydration cutting is banned

MMA,not_removed,love watching you fight man hope you get huge success wherever you go or if you remain in the ufc that magny performance was amazing
MMA,not_removed,man i really feel like you are being underappreciated by the ufc youre a well spoken smart guy and definitely an exciting and skilled fighter and it kind of seems like the ufc figured they could walk all over you its good that youve taken a step back and are weighing your options even if you go back to the ufc at least youve shown other fighters that you guys dont have to be afraid to stand up for yourselves good to see that you recognize your worth it seems like some fighters dont big fan lorenz hope everything works out for you and we see you fighting soon

MMA,not_removed,lorenz doing this ama on mobile confirmed
MMA,not_removed,damn he dodged that pornstar question like the matrix
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,it wasnt anything scandalous it was just some webseries where pornstars learn to do stuff i was just messing with him
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,meth or heroin
MMA,not_removed,you a wavy dude
MMA,not_removed,finally someone else who puts the greatest on while working
MMA,not_removed,its clear as day from the responses here youre a fan favorite and for some reason you were kinda held back in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,you will shine over there man theyve turned a corner this year some big signings especially in the ww division you vs mvp is a real tasty fight
MMA,not_removed,when you were added to the roster your striking was worse than it is now
MMA,not_removed,i would be honored d
MMA,not_removed,and lorenz can actually make weight
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah post your slip then
MMA,not_removed,hair
MMA,not_removed,madnessthis is larkin
MMA,not_removed,fight night thing

MMA,not_removed,any social media organizations youre looking at signing with at the moment how are negotiations going
MMA,not_removed,danaa please
MMA,not_removed,obsessed
MMA,not_removed,i let out a girly scream when i saw his comment ðððâ
MMA,not_removed,who owns sherdogs wife
MMA,not_removed,he just said he fucks
MMA,not_removed,what else ya got lorenz
MMA,not_removed,the late great andy hug was the first guy ive ever seen do it he won the grand prix championship when he kod mike bernardo with a spinning low kick to the thigh
MMA,not_removed,this might be my favorite ama ever though these brutally short honest answers are killing me
MMA,not_removed,for me it was just getting all the dead skin from the bottom of my feet removed fight week so i can have grip on the mat fight week then just start getting them painted
MMA,not_removed,your nails especially toenails get to looking ugly as shit during training
MMA,not_removed,chuck said he used to do it as a distraction as for larkin not so sure why
MMA,not_removed,why does a guy have to justify it im a straight married father i paint my toenails men can appreciate color fashion too plus im a beach volleyball player
MMA,not_removed,neo
MMA,not_removed,why pick one
MMA,not_removed,no disrespect but it could be reaaaally ugly for page
MMA,not_removed,so you get the riverside bell carved in no matter what city youre in or does one of your people that travel with you do it
MMA,not_removed,that aint real ninja shit
MMA,not_removed,dc bod
MMA,not_removed,shit this is like when you go on someones facebook and go back to their profile pics from this might even be the case for this photo too
MMA,not_removed,why they have a fat cormier pic there
MMA,not_removed,goddamnit
MMA,not_removed,logical progression
MMA,not_removed,yess sir
MMA,not_removed,not really depends on the person and their style of training
MMA,not_removed,dont steal my thunder karma with a one word reply lorenz i know you dont wanna catch these hands
MMA,not_removed,how long until jarred pulls out
MMA,not_removed,jarred had a fight scheduled on that he pulled out of due to injury according to tapology weird
MMA,not_removed,seery v pickett at catchweight please
MMA,not_removed,and jarred brooks misses weight
MMA,not_removed,getianmcallafight
MMA,not_removed,alright so whats this about ian mccalls gang past again
MMA,not_removed,jarred brooks weighs in at lbs
MMA,not_removed,news just in jarred brooks hit by bus on way to sign contract
MMA,not_removed,glad the ufc is getting mccall a fight that man deserves a fight after so many pull outs and fight cancellations
MMA,not_removed,brooks is ready
MMA,not_removed,say what you will about his persona and how he comes off but the guy is just trying to be a good influence for his daughter and hes trying to earn money to pay back rent that he owes his parents the guy is a world class flyweight and would be champion in any other organization ufc doesnt necessarily need ian mccall but they dont not need him
MMA,not_removed,counting down the hours before he is struck by lightening
MMA,not_removed,at this point why would you even sign to fight mccall you might as well book a surgery at the same time
MMA,not_removed,what that makes no sense at all
MMA,not_removed,the fight was announced in december so he pulled out of the fight early he seems to be ready to fight now
MMA,not_removed,he fought at in his last fight so hopefully he is good
MMA,not_removed,he won one round against mighty mouse who gassed because of a bad weight cut and then lost the rematch convincingly he was also dominated by joseph benavidez
MMA,not_removed,you think he would be hes lost every high profile fight in his career
MMA,not_removed,hes in the ufc against guys who arent mighty mouse in wecufc total he would almost certainly not be champion
MMA,not_removed,hes basically the defense against the dark arts position of mma
MMA,not_removed,the cain strategy
MMA,not_removed,people drop out of fights all the time on regional shows injury could mean he wasnt interested anymore thought he could get a better dealfight elsewhere or thought the promoter didnt know what he was doing my guess anyway
MMA,not_removed,simply speaking potential and skill level the dude is right up there watch his fights with mm or any of his fights really dude has had a lot of bad life choices and luck happen to him in all sorts of ways some guys just never get to reach their full potential no excuse of course but his absence in the division is noticeable
MMA,not_removed,jumping in very cold water can be somewhat of an out of body experience
MMA,not_removed,hahaha i know that feelingit just strikes me as odd that he casually fights with enormous people and risks brain injury for a livingbut the ice bath was difficult
MMA,not_removed,rmmaww
MMA,not_removed,this is the funniest thing ive seen in a while
MMA,not_removed,jesus christhe is juiced to the gills atm lol
MMA,not_removed,is just slav
MMA,not_removed,stop cro cop is a legend he cant be on steroids you deserve to be banished for your treason
MMA,not_removed,looks natty to me
MMA,not_removed,this was before the gonzaga fight iirc so no he likely wasnt because of usada and all that
MMA,not_removed,oh believe me im not saying hes a wussjust that fighting gigantic men seems like itd be way harder
MMA,not_removed,that fight was pre usada
MMA,not_removed,fight or flight he has skills to deal with big guys theres no skill here his body is turning on every alarm to get him out hes just telling it no and chilling
MMA,not_removed,i stand corrected you are right they fought in april and usada came in june
MMA,not_removed,i honesty had forgotten they fought a time
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan you just made the list
MMA,not_removed,if she hates rogan she must hate everyone with even a passing interest in mma he literally couldnt be a bigger fan
MMA,not_removed,sounds pretty par for the course these days with ronda always reminds me of the infamous story of her blowing up on pvz because she congratulated holly after her win
MMA,not_removed,fairweather fake human optimization bitch
MMA,not_removed,joe is in rondas head
MMA,not_removed,not surprising for better or worse this is who ronda is
MMA,not_removed,rogan on suicide watch as we speak
MMA,not_removed,ronda is the sorest loser and people who used to be in her judo camp said the same thing like if you look at her response to losing in the olympics and only getting bronze was to quit judo entirely she could have easily come back for the next olympics instead she fucked off to venice beach and became a bartender before doing mma anyone has ever said a bad thing about her is basically blacklisted and her mother isnt much different
MMA,not_removed,ronda is mentally unstable emotionally underdeveloped and on the low end of the intelligence stick this is not surprising at all
MMA,not_removed,ronda is the worst sore loser in the history of humanity
MMA,not_removed,she is about to get ktfo i think her head is fucked
MMA,not_removed,well if that pvz story is true this wouldnt be surprising if it came out as true aswell i dont know how mad she actually is though so who knows
MMA,not_removed,thought it might add another perspective to the walkingoffthestage thing
MMA,not_removed,heres a youtube link linking itunes you fucking momo
MMA,not_removed,this wouldnt be the first time for ronda to be acting that way reminds me of the time she cussed pvz out for congratulating holly on her victory
MMA,not_removed,she hardly expects industry analysts to ignore one of the biggest names in the sport losing for the first time in spectacular fashion petulant child
MMA,not_removed,it will be interesting to see if she wins how she will deal with the interview
MMA,not_removed,fake ass podcasting alpha brain humility bitch
MMA,not_removed,ronda isnt emotionally stable enough to compete after her loss like shes lashing out at everyone she needs a good psychologist not to get her dome dinged again
MMA,not_removed,brandon schaub had some interesting insights after dating her i think she is bi polar she has serious issues batshit crazy travis bowne can have her
MMA,not_removed,so she hates everyone who criticized her glad she has the right mentality heading into her fight after a year lay off lol
MMA,not_removed,jerichoesque in her use of a list joe
MMA,not_removed,rogan crying into his rousey body pillow right now
MMA,not_removed,shes probably furious with me for some reason
MMA,not_removed,damn says a lot about rondas ego
MMA,not_removed,ladies and gents this is the second biggest star in our sport embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,does anyone actually give a fuck about honda still go have traviss babies ya dnb
MMA,not_removed,number of fucks joe gives
MMA,not_removed,and to think he once said she was once in human history and had elite striking
MMA,not_removed,meisha tate pvz apples joe rogan
MMA,not_removed,does she see a sports psychologist all pro athletes should imo but especially ronda
MMA,not_removed,explains why she walked off
MMA,not_removed,shes a do nothing sore loser
MMA,not_removed,why is ronda mad at joe rogan again
MMA,not_removed,i dont listen to joey often but that last line i could have read it anywhere and i would have known it was him
MMA,not_removed,i think she hates everyone in mma judging by her lack of cooperation with mma media it still doesnt feel like shes about to fight in a month
MMA,not_removed,that chick is hella crazy
MMA,not_removed,i really like ronda but she seems like a college student that needs a safe space
MMA,not_removed,once in a lifetime doesnt apply to ronda rousey its once ever in human history joe rogan she really is working to earn her themesong though what a bitch
MMA,not_removed,i guess ronda made her own list of jericho
MMA,not_removed,i hope nunes beats her she really needs to be more humble look at how conor treated his loss
MMA,not_removed,im not surprised at all that ronda have a personal blacklist
MMA,not_removed,how about instead of getting ass chapped and taking a year and a half to come back she gets back on the high horse and proves people wrong butthurt rhonda is butthurt
MMA,not_removed,imagine how weird it must be between her and her mom after all the coach shit lol
MMA,not_removed,she really needs to take a step back from fighting for her mental well being obviouslyno joke in all seriousness the fight game does not suit her whatsoeverwhere can i get odds on her pulling from the nunes fight
MMA,not_removed,the balloon that never stops inflating even after popping
MMA,not_removed,i miss ronda i really do but it seems her persona of being a huge bitch is more than just a persona and it makes me really not want to like her nobody is ever allowed to say negative things about her thats bullshit
MMA,not_removed,as far as i heard joe rogan has always bern respectful if this is true all this small stories about ronda being mad at paige and all this she still is in a really bad place and broken mentally and should not fight never seen someone take a loss this bad i feel bad for her so much anger for nothing
MMA,not_removed,what joe said where her mom said i love rhondas judo was really nice to see that in the womens division really beautiful but her standup needs some real fuckin work
MMA,not_removed,we know she was furious at pvz just for saying congratulations to holly holm ronda is a fucking sociopathic bitch of the highest order and nunes will destroy her in the first round rondas not fighting cans anymore
MMA,not_removed,how emotionally immature is rousey that the slightest criticism from a person who talks about mma is automatically an enemy like how are you that emotionally undeveloped that you dont have any sense of perspective to see that relations with others tend to have some nuance or complexity to them
MMA,not_removed,really starting to hope nunes punches her into absolute obscurity
MMA,not_removed,i saw ronda rousey at a grocery store in los angeles yesterday i told her how cool it was to meet her in person but i didnt want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything she said oh like youre doing now i was taken aback and all i could say was huh but she kept cutting me off and going huh huh huh and closing her hand shut in front of my face i walked away and continued with my shopping and i heard her chuckle as i walked off when i came to pay for my stuff up front i saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen milky ways in her hands without paying the girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like maam you need to pay for those first at first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter when she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times she stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me i dont even think thats a word after she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price she kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly
MMA,not_removed,lol shes mad cuz joe finally calmed down on the love for her its hard not to dislike ronda at times
MMA,not_removed,whats hilarious is that rogan was accused of being frankly enamoured with ronda and sung her praises like she was the greatest athlete ever anyone remember his infamous debate with donald cerrone on her striking but he simply points out that she made a mistake against holly and romda goes nuclear i think ronda needs serious help either therapy or religion at this point everything ive heard of her behaviour points to her being an unstable maladjusted person with a hair trigger temper
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan would beat rondas ass
MMA,not_removed,ronda is such an immature bitch honestly
MMA,not_removed,yea shes an unstable crazy bitch pretty sure we got that one figured out
MMA,not_removed,well at least shes in a good mindset going in to a fight
MMA,not_removed,it isnt going to end well when ronda has to fight nunesronda really needs to see a sports psychologist
MMA,not_removed,she is so fucking triggered by everything
MMA,not_removed,looks like she is never gonna learn to deal with an l
MMA,not_removed,i like ronda but ugh anyone she isnt furious with
MMA,not_removed,its interesting to me that within the same year the two biggest stars in the sport both had their first ufc losses and how they handled that loss and how they acted towards the media is so opposite of each other there will probably in the next years be a for or a documentary like that on conor and on ronda but id love another one on the parallels and comparisons of their careers during the same time period because its such a unique contrast
MMA,not_removed,damn is ronda okay because she doesnt seem to be
MMA,not_removed,i said this in other post months ago when rogan suddenly started to talk shit about ronda and overall about edmond well deserved but yea rogan yesterday was the first fan of her today is a hater and tomorrow who the fucks know maybe if mcgregor losses he start to talk shit too instead of so much dicksucking
MMA,not_removed,i dont recall joe saying anything negative about her just that she shouldnt have rushed in against holly he was overly complimentary towards her before that so she needs to lighten the fuck up psycho chick
MMA,not_removed,bitch is crazy psycho clinger stage real tho shes got some problems
MMA,not_removed,jesus christ tim kennedy and ronda should have babies biblical pillars of salt and shit
MMA,not_removed,i went to this place and ran into this guy who said this zero credit to this story
MMA,not_removed,all of a sudden she thinks shes steve buscemi from billy madison
MMA,not_removed,she pissed at megan olivi too wondering whos gonna talk to her for the prefight press
MMA,not_removed,what ronda doesnt realise is if she keeps burning these bridges now then shes going to have nowhere to go in a few years time especially when hollywood is much more fickle then mma ever will be
MMA,not_removed,ronda is a certifiable head case i take no pleasure in the realization of that i hope she doesnt get starched by an and then commit suicide shes not right in the head and her movies are on hold because shes not good at acting hopefully she can keep it all in perspective and live a good life with the money shes earned i could see this all going horribly wrong
MMA,not_removed,ronda needs to grow up
MMA,not_removed,shes going full cersei
MMA,not_removed,like if ronda wrote a book all the characters would just be angry assholes who think the world is out to get them and that she has to vanquish anyone who stands in her way because thats the singular way she seems to see the world we can make fun of her striking or her dumb coach but first thing she has to do is see a damn psychiatrist because her all or nothing black or white thinking is fucking insane
MMA,not_removed,honestly im crazy and i relate to her short of saying something racist or killing someone id still be a fan lmao and even then theyd probably deserve it
MMA,not_removed,i mean hate and negativity seems to be the only way she can motivate herself in competition shes not the only fighter who finds a way to rationalize everyone as their enemy shes just extra annoying and inyourface about it
MMA,not_removed,thats third hand at least unsubstantiated info if the telephone game has caught me anything its that reports like this should be taken with a mountain of salt
MMA,not_removed,someone posted httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrifgwgefdw here its hilarious props to the op i couldnt find it again edit found it props to udsrii d thanks
MMA,not_removed,turns out being told how awesome you are for years while young turns your personality to shit
MMA,not_removed,i kinda like ronda when she is normal but something is just seriously wrong with her cant take any critique
MMA,not_removed,httpsyoutubeakmlptxbndq
MMA,not_removed,if this fuels darth honda to come back with a literal vengeance and dominate the way she did beforethen awesome
MMA,not_removed,well shes got to get her shit straight and focus on her fight because amanda might just rip her head off
MMA,not_removed,so basically some dude whos a big mma dude said it to joey who told us so it must be true then again ronda has always seemed very mercurial
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,shes the worst loser ever theres no competition
MMA,not_removed,lol shes crazy i hope she gets kod again but nunes isnt some elite fighter so shell have a chance
MMA,not_removed,man i cant fucking wait if she loses gonna be some great stuff
MMA,not_removed,shes such a headcase
MMA,not_removed,ronda is a fucking joke
MMA,not_removed,aint that a kick in the head
MMA,not_removed,and that is why ronda rousey will never improve right there the attitude that she should be free from criticism
MMA,not_removed,yep and according to rogan shed easily take out any male fighter in the rogan is a lot heavier but id bet hes scared either that or he was just talking bs
MMA,not_removed,shes got the hillary clinton disease lol
MMA,not_removed,such a brat she has the mentality of a grade bully
MMA,not_removed,i believe this and commented the same at the time it was clear when dana clearly grabbed her arm then went around saying how not mad she was she is a good fighter but seriously damaged as a person to think everyone is always out to get her
MMA,not_removed,this sounds eerily like the us president elect
MMA,not_removed,because of the podcast on the plane the next day she must wanna rip danas balls off shove them down his throat and watch him simultaneously choke and bleed to death kinda explains them errproduction error my guys fucked up again rondas totally not mad at anyone i swear
MMA,not_removed,i wanna be hated by ronda too how can i get on the list
MMA,not_removed,shes still believing her own hype i see
MMA,not_removed,fucking ronda what a wingnut
MMA,not_removed,jesus is there anyone ronda isnt angry at
MMA,not_removed,ronda is so constantly sour im surprised travis brownes dick hasnt melted off
MMA,not_removed,poor ronda she is that bratty kid that got whatever she wanted until aunt holly came over for the holidays and slapped the shit out of her then after aunt holly left she went back to being the same old brat
MMA,not_removed,thank you brotha stay black cuz thats the most important thing
MMA,not_removed,video link
MMA,not_removed,i guess thats why she didnt want to be interviewed at the weigh ins
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan is heartbroken right now
MMA,not_removed,does anyone remember conor had same onslaught after the loss people and fighters celebrating he used it to fuel himself and prove doubters ronda forgot the business she was in for every person who cheers for you there is another wanting to see you lose but they all show up on fight night
MMA,not_removed,im not shocked seemed like they use to be really close but after she was knocked out joe never really gave us any direct updates about whats going on with her so i already guessed she cut contact with him because she most likely thinks he back stabbed her somehow
MMA,not_removed,i can see why tbh joe rogan did a on ronda as soon as she got kod joe rogan went from flawless striking to shes always had holes in her game overnight
MMA,not_removed,ronda not taking criticism well stop the presses
MMA,not_removed,shes probably mad at justin wren and sage northcutt too
MMA,not_removed,you just made the list
MMA,not_removed,did joe really say anything negative
MMA,not_removed,glad to see she hasnt changed
MMA,not_removed,uh oh guys sounds like rmma is off her christmas card list
MMA,not_removed,this does not surprise me
MMA,not_removed,shes furious with everyone
MMA,not_removed,great now joeys on the list
MMA,not_removed,whos shocked
MMA,not_removed,you just made the list ronda rousey is the real life chris jericho
MMA,not_removed,here is the link to the youtube video
MMA,not_removed,i cant remember anything that bad joe ever said about her
MMA,not_removed,this just in ronda rousey is and always has been completely fucking nuts
MMA,not_removed,big if true
MMA,not_removed,i hope ronda isnt actually this crazy maybe the guy is full of shit and joey is just high as fuck
MMA,not_removed,joey diaz friend of joe rogan and comedy extraordinaire this is the first time anyone has ever called joey diaz extraordinaire
MMA,not_removed,thats hilarious
MMA,not_removed,this doesnt sound right to me ronda acting like a childhmmidk about that
MMA,not_removed,heres the clip
MMA,not_removed,so she gonna fight him
MMA,not_removed,i have a feeling that anyone rhonda knows gets on her list eventually she obviously has issues its possible the same thing that makes her a great fighter
MMA,not_removed,she likes or needs to hate to be who she is
MMA,not_removed,she has worldclass hate onceinalifetime hate
MMA,not_removed,mad at joe meanwhile her fucking coach doesnt believe in kicks thats e contributing factor to that ko her shitty coach
MMA,not_removed,i bet ronda would have some dank material for rthepack mfers
MMA,not_removed,fuck ronda her striking coach is a joke and she clearly has some emotional development issues i think shell lose and retire
MMA,not_removed,so this is why she stormed off after the face off dana lied again d
MMA,not_removed,i knew when he had miesha on the podcast that ronda was going to be piiissed
MMA,not_removed,oh boy looks like most of us are on that list too then
MMA,not_removed,i figured thats why she walked off stage all pissed off looking during that face off with nunes she didnt wanna talk with rogan
MMA,not_removed,she sets herself up to make losses more brutal im not on the conor bandwagon but everyone has to admit he handled the diaz loss pretty well by seeking revenge rather than curl up in a ball go into acting horribly and contemplate suicide
MMA,not_removed,who would win in a fight rousey or rogan
MMA,not_removed,as much as people love to witness greatness rise to inspire them they double down on the enthusiasm when that greatness falls so that they can continue justifying their meager existence it doesnt matter that ronda was the face of womens mma for years and made every opponent she faced appear to be second or third rate while undefeated her behavior was that of a champion now that she has been defeated the inferior can pick and choose which behavior to analyze to make themselves out to be the better person ignoring the fact that they have accomplished nothing it doesnt matter that ronda will take yet another chance to prove her greatness or that she has millions of dollars in the bank because of her greatness they now hold a fictitious victory over her which makes them feel better about themselves she has reaped the rewards of her greatness and will seek further opportunities to prove herself they will go back to their miserable existences with boosted egos who is the real loser
MMA,not_removed,serious question have you ever seen anyone be a worse loser i know i cant
MMA,not_removed,fucking god we really gonna do this kind of shit now are we entertainment tonight
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan violated her safe space
MMA,not_removed,this all sounds extremely anecdotal slow news day
MMA,not_removed,ronda is the definition for a girl that has daddy issues beings what happened with her dad i actually get it
MMA,not_removed,i hope this isnt true but it probably is damn ronda i still root for you why you gotta be so crazy sensitive there is no logical reason for her to be pissed at joe unless something really sketch happened behind the scenes joe has sung rondas praises harder than anyone theres no good reason for her to blacklist him i still like rousey for whatever reason but this is the kind of shit that i cant stand in people i meet if someone is so incapable of handling feedback that isnt gushing praise without taking it as an attack then they force everyone else to decide to either a walk on eggshells around that person forever to stay on their good side or b say fuck it you dont deserve my time and then a good influence is out of that persons life just because they cant handle constructive criticism
MMA,not_removed,man it hurts me to see what kind of person she seems to be she should be thanking him instead i just remembered recently that rondas first time on rogans podcast was actually what made me aware of her i had seen stumbled over mma clips on youtube occasionally over the years but never really followed it when she was on jre they talked a lot about how shes dominating everyone so i looked up her fights and god damn that was dominant indeed i kept looking her up on the net every few months after being undefeated and still as dominant for a few more fights i started putting reminders in my calender for her next fights when holly knocked her out it shook up my world i did not expect that at all and i was blown away that was probably the point that got me hooked on mma for good and ive been buying several ppvs since have been to an event in my country and i also have a fight pass subscription now so basically she made me an mma fan if you will these last months ive been hoping for her comeback and was really happy when was announced i never thought that id ever root against her but after reading this im kinda considering putting money on nunes this is not a mindset that wins fights
MMA,not_removed,ronda as a trainwreck of a human being is way more entertaining than her fights ever were
MMA,not_removed,rmma is a trip youre all in a tizzy because joey diaz heard from some big time mma guy that ronda rousey was mad at joe rogan this is like fourth hand information you guys are worse than people magazine
MMA,not_removed,what a narcissist shes upset with joe speaking the truth well boooo hoooo thats life honey you are not a special or unique snowflake
MMA,not_removed,ronda is such a child she loses and expects everyone to kiss her ass hope she gets ktfod again by nunes this time and retires for good
MMA,not_removed,oh boy im keen for the meltdown post her next fight
MMA,not_removed,this thread is what i would call a gathering of cunts
MMA,not_removed,this sounds like the very definition of honda to a tee
MMA,not_removed,im not surprised mothafuckas in all seriousness she seemed like she would go after everyone after i heard that she hated ariel then paige and now joe rogan doesnt seem too far out there
MMA,not_removed,ronda is insane and has serious issues this is no surprise
MMA,not_removed,lol if this is true i hope she gets blasted by nunes get the fuck over yourself
MMA,not_removed,ronda is legit so fucking weird man
MMA,not_removed,that girl is nuts yo seriously has to be the sorest loser ive seen in a looong time so much so that now im rooting against hershes got such a wooden personality
MMA,not_removed,have people not figured out that this is how she pumps herself up for a fight she makes up enemies in her mind to destroy
MMA,not_removed,fake stoner ass fake cheap supplements fake crying bastard once in human history my ass i see right through you joe rogan
MMA,not_removed,this makes me hate her even more what is joe suppose to say she looked great in that fight her boxing is world class fuck out of here grow up and take your loss like an adult learn from it and move on
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan is going to be heart broken hearing this news the way he was worshipping her it sounds like ronda has a lot of personal issues going into this fight bet the house on michael jackson
MMA,not_removed,god she is such a child rogan is her biggest cheerleader and she even finds a way to be pissed at him one loss and she goes off the rails getting mad at everyone and refusing to do any media outside of softball questions on talk shows shes got issues
MMA,not_removed,is anyone surprised by this the thing where she tried to bully paige for congratulating holly says it all this is who she is youre either behind her or her enemy and the latter is much bigger than the former now and growing
MMA,not_removed,but but ronda loves pokÃ©mon and pikachu shes a good person s
MMA,not_removed,it appears all the good list and emotionally unbalanced jokes have been taken you guys are good
MMA,not_removed,it sounds fucking exhausting trying to be someone that has to navigate rhondas moods im certain joe is not losing any sleep over it but i cant say the same for travis
MMA,not_removed,oh noesthe honda is mad
MMA,not_removed,i know everyone finds him funny but i find him rather boring and i dont believe half of what he says
MMA,not_removed,i really hope she takes another ass whooping puts on like lbs then jumps off a bridge shes just a shitty fake person shes a terrible role model and a poor sport
MMA,not_removed,you stupid idiot
MMA,not_removed,you know what happens when you criticize ronda rousey huh you know what happens when you say something negative huh do you you just made list
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrifgwgefdw
MMA,not_removed,cersei lannister the hound joe rogan
MMA,not_removed,drink it in maaaaaaaaan
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i can see joe getting nancy kerrigand in the near future by edmond or travis
MMA,not_removed,im marking out
MMA,not_removed,so happy this is the second highest comment
MMA,not_removed,ronda stark
MMA,not_removed,he got put in the penalty box
MMA,not_removed,made me think of dads army
MMA,not_removed,you just made me very happy
MMA,not_removed,you guys have no fucking idea the satisfaction i get coming into an rmma thread imagining what the top upvoted wrestling comment would be and then seeing it yea i probably need some friends
MMA,not_removed,ronda in taken i have particular skills and making lists is one of them you dont want to be on my list
MMA,not_removed,you know who didnt make the list sage
MMA,not_removed,just wait till she hears about the shadow box memes
MMA,not_removed,joes exaggerated hype of her helped her reach that level fame ronda got plenty of first round finishes but joe amplified her media presence
MMA,not_removed,hes definitely toned it down quite a bit hes gone from thinking she could beat men to doubting she can get past nunes which was a more realistic opinion from him in the podcast with schaub the other day this was after schaub said ronda will destroy her too
MMA,not_removed,she was never my friend
MMA,not_removed,its basically mean girls with ass kickings
MMA,not_removed,pound fairweather bitch
MMA,not_removed,greatness comes in different shapes and sizes but often the greats do seem to be some level of cray cray
MMA,not_removed,ronda is gonna get smoked by amanda then shell probably apologize
MMA,not_removed,the nunesrousey staredown makes more sense if this is true she hates rogan so much that she couldnt be bothered with answering any questions from him to promote the fight
MMA,not_removed,fake cheap shotting fake onnit thats fake onnit ass bitch
MMA,not_removed,fake human optimization bitch to be fair he does sell fake human optimization pills
MMA,not_removed,rent free
MMA,not_removed,balls deep
MMA,not_removed,i think youd be surprised
MMA,not_removed,it is and people never think about why people will get downvoted over and over again for contributing to the discussion but just putting it out there her dad broke his back and became paralyzed then killed himself when she was her mom is clearly batshit insane and contributed towards ronda having a onetrack mind now obviously circumstances are one thing how you react is another but around here people act like she chose to be unstable while i dont agree with the way she handled everything the utter hatred that came out when she lost was crazy as hell you have an unstable person with a shitty childhood at a low point and everyone comes out of the woodworks to kick them when theyre down is anyone surprised suicide crossed her mind and maybe not even necessarily due to the loss by itself
MMA,not_removed,thats exactly why i never understood rmmas old obsession with her she grew up in an unstable household and lived out of her car for a long time then hit overnight fame while under the watch of an exploitative sleazy mma coach whos being investigated for tax evasion now everyones all surprised to hear how fucked in the head she really is she also looks like a grumpy ugly petulant child when shes meanmugging hate that shit
MMA,not_removed,rogan will probably end up sitting down with her to hash it out like he did with rampage
MMA,not_removed,probably not hes moved on it seems
MMA,not_removed,i actually found out about ronda a long time ago because of her moms blog i do not know how i stumbled in her moms blog at the timei was reading about startups so that might be itthing isher mom seems very smart and not as sensitive to criticism as her so i do not understand why you say that her mom isnt much different
MMA,not_removed,congratulations you just made her list
MMA,not_removed,you are now banned from rrondarousey
MMA,not_removed,i would say emotionally underdeveloped it a great way to describe her she just hasnt grown up i wouldnt say she isnt intelligent though
MMA,not_removed,ronda should be thanking joe rogan for hyping her up all these year ronda isnt even closer to half the trash talker that conor is but she still pulled huge ppvs joe was doing all the promotion for her
MMA,not_removed,she does look like she has some kind of retardation
MMA,not_removed,i think its a bit more simple than that she is trailer trash
MMA,not_removed,thats a bit much isnt it lets not start playing armchair psychologist
MMA,not_removed,would you say once ever
MMA,not_removed,jim harbaugh is up there
MMA,not_removed,after tonya harding
MMA,not_removed,yeah a oneyear layoff staying at edmonds camp and a shitty attitude while being thrown into a title fight against nunes points to ronda getting slept again
MMA,not_removed,her head has always been fucked and its never really hurt her in the cage shes still by far the best fighter at amanda plays right into rondas strengths shes going to come straight in and rondas going to clinch and take her down amanda is really getting overrated just because people dislike ronda so much she got ragdolled by cat holly and valentina are still the only fighters with the striking and footwork to beat her thats also why i still think she beats cyborg cyborg walks straight in and gets clinched by low level regional fighters if she does that against ronda shell be on the mat
MMA,not_removed,what pvz story edit uwejaeger linked it below
MMA,not_removed,heres the youtube link
MMA,not_removed,but didnt the bald one say nothing went wrong there i believed him
MMA,not_removed,it may i kind of think she wants to wait until she is champ again to talk to the mma people coming from a position of power again like mcgregor didnt want to do media after he lost to diaz its probably a lot easier to wait let your performance speak for itself and then talk after youve righted the wrong
MMA,not_removed,ronda needs an heroic dose of mushrooms
MMA,not_removed,funny thing is she does
MMA,not_removed,dont make me root for her in that fight
MMA,not_removed,they had to be the most annoying couple to be around
MMA,not_removed,he also dated her and then said his new girl made her look like oscar the grouch with tits seemed like he might have a bit of resentment
MMA,not_removed,its broken
MMA,not_removed,sad was glad to see that rr lost her championship fight last night was soundly beaten not a nice person trump
MMA,not_removed,why blue cheese why not orange cheese or green cheese
MMA,not_removed,she did go on his podcast with her trainer when she was still one of the most famous people on the planet he was eating it up like everyone else was and it was literally something hed never seen before
MMA,not_removed,sports psychologist ronda i think it would be best if it was just me and you in these meetings edmund can wait outside
MMA,not_removed,she needs a regular psychologist
MMA,not_removed,because reasons
MMA,not_removed,she is angry at anyone that said anything about her defeat basically pretty worrying stuff is not grounded in reality
MMA,not_removed,rogan you stupid idiot
MMA,not_removed,while rousey was playing pokemon
MMA,not_removed,how dare you talk about me that way
MMA,not_removed,a lifelong con job like christian bale in the prestige
MMA,not_removed,a guntouting crossdresser
MMA,not_removed,classic siege mentality
MMA,not_removed,i dont think the fact that he was unable to deny the royal ass kicking that was occurring right in front of him was an indicator of joe jumping ship in fact he sounded hilariously distressed watching his bae get battered and then layed out like a roll of turf
MMA,not_removed,he was absolutely talking bs or believed her hype any male would destroy ronda
MMA,not_removed,who by the way thinks ronda is a not very nice person
MMA,not_removed,edmond
MMA,not_removed,he did it midfight
MMA,not_removed,well he probably had to play the game for ufc brass or was blinded by her insane judo that decimated anyone who got in the octagon with her or hes full of shit for such a smart guy rogan is full of shit more often than id like him to be
MMA,not_removed,saying something like she got outclassed is probably enough for her to write your name down
MMA,not_removed,meager existence lol
MMA,not_removed,there are sore losers out there but ronda is a sore winner look at her on tuf winning a coaches challenge and after the meisha fight she wouldnt even shake her hand
MMA,not_removed,joe warren
MMA,not_removed,get off your high horse this isnt the production room of
MMA,not_removed,youre changing you opinion of someone based on gossip seriously
MMA,not_removed,no surprise she has always acted like a petulant child
MMA,not_removed,i lost a ton of respect for him for that
MMA,not_removed,take it easy man you sound like a shittier person than her when you say that kind of shit
MMA,not_removed,hey fuck you there are so many worse people in mma and none of them deserve to have death wished on them because you dont like them the damage of your comment is minimal but the damage that does occur will happen to you no happy successful nice worthwhile person gets on the internet and wishes an athlete would murder themselves take a long hard look in the mirror you piece of shit
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,hahahahhaha thanks for the laugh love ya
MMA,not_removed,i feel like edmond would fuck it up and injure his own knee
MMA,not_removed,could either of them reach low enough to hit him in the knee
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,rsquaredcircle didnt come here to take part were here to take over
MMA,not_removed,rsquaredcircle is leaking
MMA,not_removed,shadow box meme care to share im not aware of those
MMA,not_removed,really mean girls coming summer to a theater near you
MMA,not_removed,hood girls
MMA,not_removed,face kickings
MMA,not_removed,yep that crazy unhinged grudge holding energy is the same thing that pushes you through all the endless garbagedramaboring and grinding periods that most people get tripped up on michael jordan is also like this and is basically a fucking crazy person in his personal life its the same thing that made him great and you cant just walk off the court and flip a switch off
MMA,not_removed,name one genius that aint crazy
MMA,not_removed,amanda is the perfect opponent for ronda her only real shot is if ronda just doesnt train
MMA,not_removed,use the phrase fake ass bitch and receive any and all supplements
MMA,not_removed,they post the fake ass supplement recipes on the website
MMA,not_removed,for sure
MMA,not_removed,bottom line youre judged by how you treat others the circumstances can ameliorate that to an extent but does it really matter if shes shitting on people due to ego fragility or just because of narcissism i feel for her but i also think she should be held accountable for her eccentricities although the maliciousness directed at her i agree is childish and lacking in a reasonable amount of empathy
MMA,not_removed,isnt it possible to justify everyone who acts terribly by saying its a result of their life experiences thats everyone in the world she didnt choose to be unstable that completely absolves her from a lot of her actions shes a grown adult and she absolutely is choosing to be mad at rogan who is one of her biggest fans its her choice to feel that way
MMA,not_removed,definitely agree with you but didnt she black out media after the loss yet still contemplated suicide i feel like that part wasnt on the backlash just her own emotional immaturityfuckedupedness
MMA,not_removed,i think its also what gives her that incredible drive that made her so much better than everyone else for so long her entire life is a grudge
MMA,not_removed,its rickdiculous that she thought im nothing after losing her fight what the fuck she has more money than any of us will ever make she can do anything she wants and never has to worry about getting a boring soul crushing job
MMA,not_removed,her mom is clearly batshit insane i think thats going a bit far shes blunt and unconventional and super typea but thats not a dealbreaker and if nothing else shes shrewd enough to realize that edmond is a knownothing toolbag whos bad for her daughter
MMA,not_removed,while i think you make a great point about her possibly being mentally unstable its been a full year if you can realize yeah i was being crazy i was in a really bad place then you need serious help and should not be fighting
MMA,not_removed,shes an adult now you can only blame your parents so far at some point its up to you to sit down think about your childhood think about yourself and your personality and think about how you should behave also she should have known that a loss fall if you cant handle the heat dont get in the kitchen
MMA,not_removed,she has siblings and they are apparently not like her her mum didnt push them to excel in martial arts because its not what they wanted they went and did other things they didnt have the mentality that she has i think youre pushing the family background angle a bit too hard
MMA,not_removed,dude you look fuckin high bruce buffer
MMA,not_removed,never seen this thanks rogan will always have this impact though his commentary style is so confident for new fans who are still learning theyll take his words as gospel its not that hes wrong its just good to encourage new fans to have a healthy scepticism with everything they hear and try watching an event with the sound off
MMA,not_removed,brought a tear to my eye
MMA,not_removed,i forgot how bad that metal intro theme was that was an interesting watch i had never seen it either thanks for posting it
MMA,not_removed,whose nuts is rogan on nowadays
MMA,not_removed,her mom is a very cold and harsh personality from almost everything ive seen im not saying shes always wrong right or whatever or that she is even a bad person just that shes massive on unconditional loyalty and that seems to be something ronda inherented you cannot say a negative word or question their logic and yeah i know annmaria de mars has a phd and was a world judo gold medialist but that doesnt make a person impervious to criticism
MMA,not_removed,she herself tweeted or had a blog post about having list of all the people who passed on investing on her video game and how theyd regret it that and the video of her hating on edmund she sounded completely unhinged but because it was about edmund every thought it was hilarious
MMA,not_removed,yeah theres never any hyperbole
MMA,not_removed,fake ass cheap shotting emotionally developed fake high end of the intelligence stick bitch
MMA,not_removed,rrondaslist
MMA,not_removed,the gift of ronda drink it in man
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,ive always believed in her
MMA,not_removed,i like this meme
MMA,not_removed,she actually does have a learning disability she didnt speak till she was because the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck
MMA,not_removed,she was on the tit til she was
MMA,not_removed,she posted a video that claimed sandy hook was a false flag along with the caption interesting this doesnt mean she believes itas for the claims i havent heard about that all this is not to say that she isnt emotionally stunted and not very smart
MMA,not_removed,at the very least we werent told everything about i doubt george bush ordered those planes into the towers though
MMA,not_removed,really
MMA,not_removed,not really armchair psychology mental instability and lack of emotional development have been proven by how she has and continues to handled her loss the low intelligence level is clearly evident via her coach choice
MMA,not_removed,that girl needs therapy
MMA,not_removed,nunes
MMA,not_removed,cyborg usually wants to be in the clinch though it was shown that a jab can put ronda in la la land now imagine the shots that hit lansburg hitting ronda
MMA,not_removed,wmma has moved on nunes kills her
MMA,not_removed,that she likes protoss over zerg blasphemous i tell you
MMA,not_removed,he said something went wrong joe wasent supposed to interview them allegedly
MMA,not_removed,also the sexiest after sage
MMA,not_removed,her ego is so damn fragile she might not make it out the other side intact
MMA,not_removed,aye its a compliment to her potential right now shes the equivalent of the greatest racing boat ever but without her mind right its a racing boat with a drunk captain thats not gonna win any races
MMA,not_removed,how bad can she be when schaub found her irritating he said that she treated him like a doormat did you wash my clothes why isnt dinner ready but he did say that the sex was crazy wild
MMA,not_removed,yes sir
MMA,not_removed,that seems crazy now given what has transpired ronda even has beef with the president of the united states
MMA,not_removed,pick a funky smell and attach it go for it
MMA,not_removed,im just imagining that sports psychologist hiring werdum to stand by the door constantly kicking edmund away as he persistently runs at the door
MMA,not_removed,the list of rousey rogan pvz the ex she beat the shit out of schaub miesha floyd mayweather holly the girl she lost to in the olympics edit cant get the formatting right
MMA,not_removed,armbar
MMA,not_removed,theres no highhorse this is elementary school shit
MMA,not_removed,huh good point i really just skimmed the text and thought yeah kinda sounds like ronda i didnt pay enough attention to the context either way its not even that ive instantly done a on her after reading this headline its rather the more stuff like this turns up the harder it gets to root for her i mean theres also the instagram post before the holly fight the pvz thing afterwards the entire way she took the loss etc i really wish shed turn things around but stuff like this makes me doubt it more and more
MMA,not_removed,youve never seen him as the leader of the new nexus
MMA,not_removed,im not a public figure so the damage should be minimal
MMA,not_removed,i didnt wish death upon her also tough internet guy im sorry your feelings got hurt because i said something about your crush
MMA,not_removed,watch what
MMA,not_removed,or nail mike goldberg
MMA,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomfamiliarglamorousfulmar
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgkmrcakivym
MMA,not_removed,its a gif of her shadowboxing but with terrible form on sherdog they even added it in the mma smiley category so people post it a lot in ronda threads
MMA,not_removed,she looks kinda better but i guess she doesnt know her meme on shadow boxing
MMA,not_removed,report really mean girls movie set to be scrapped due to studios concerns that ronda cant act
MMA,not_removed,trey parker
MMA,not_removed,mike perry
MMA,not_removed,warren buffett bill gates yo yo ma jim carmack neil degrasse tyson steve wozniak et al we could go on for years about this
MMA,not_removed,seth mcfarlane
MMA,not_removed,pablo thanks for coming
MMA,not_removed,terence tao shit someone already made a list im out of jokes to edit this
MMA,not_removed,seriously how do you think that i think amanda is a horrid opponent for ronda first of all shes going to blast her and finish her in the first round probably early even but lets say she doesnt rondas only hope is to tap her right isnt amanda a black belt on the ground maybe im off my rocker but i dont think i would put money on ronda vs hardly anyone right now but especially not amanda nunes
MMA,not_removed,can we really call what edmund does training
MMA,not_removed,can someone explain pls
MMA,not_removed,its just something people need to keep in mind as most tend to black and white everything after that your judgments are your own
MMA,not_removed,yup see hitler its that art academys fault that he killed millions he just wanted to be a painter
MMA,not_removed,she definitely deserves a fair amount of the blame but ive met far too many unfortunate people in my city to blame any one of them too much for the things that happened to them and where they ended up
MMA,not_removed,that sounds awfully like like blaming a depressed person for being depressed and telling them to walk it off and fact is whatever she is it has worked for her pretty great so far as far as accomplishments go
MMA,not_removed,spoken like someone whos never had or never dealt with anyone who has had a mental illness your sentiment is exactly whats wrong with the perception of mental health as a whole its not something you get over
MMA,not_removed,i dont think youre wrong but its pretty easy to say that as a normal human being ronda is obscenely successful and surrounded by people who no doubt just tell her what she wants to hear reality does not provide her many incentives to sort her attitude out in fact it pretty much does the opposite
MMA,not_removed,and she got rocked by holly can you spell brain damage
MMA,not_removed,good point i heard the same though id imagine she heard about some of it regardless
MMA,not_removed,definitely theres a whole lot of people who achieved greatness while being accused of being psychotic assholes etc
MMA,not_removed,corn nuts corn to the core waitthat might be goldie
MMA,not_removed,he seems to at least have a half chub when talking about khabib but idk
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse and mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,deez nuts
MMA,not_removed,cam hanes
MMA,not_removed,her mom lobbied for her to leave edmund though
MMA,not_removed,lol nicely done
MMA,not_removed,rondaslist
MMA,not_removed,ronda preparing for joining wwe her unstable personality will fit right in as part of character so no one will even notice
MMA,not_removed,most of these stupid idiots didnt even get the reference
MMA,not_removed,is that gary oldman
MMA,not_removed,replace with pol and its accurate
MMA,not_removed,you would think it wouldve take them a little sooner than years to realise there was an umbilical cord wrapped around her neck
MMA,not_removed,does that mean she has a natural boosted immunity to strangleholds
MMA,not_removed,shouldve tapped sooner imo
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,thats what people say when they believe a conspiracy theory but dont want to have to defend it httpwwwgeoengineeringwatchorgchemtrailshatemichigantoday and now the water is polluted interesting
MMA,not_removed,private lessons with edgy brah will do that
MMA,not_removed,i cant remember what she said exactly but i remember seeing a few articles saying that ronda believes was an inside job and she tweeted out some conspiracy sandy hook video with the comment interesting or something along those lines
MMA,not_removed,she re tweeted something so maybe
MMA,not_removed,the low intelligence level is clearly evident via her coach choice httpiimgurcomvqlgjolgif
MMA,not_removed,hmm smart people sometimes do a lot of stupid stuff mainly because of the mental instability
MMA,not_removed,i think its pretty clear that she is smart not just witty
MMA,not_removed,the low intelligence level is clearly evident via her coach choice hahahahah
MMA,not_removed,nunes seems to be a lot badder than pena too
MMA,not_removed,you really cant fuck with the colossus as zerg
MMA,not_removed,also said she had manly shoulders when fucking her from behind
MMA,not_removed,she also said that lube was for lazy guys im guessing she doesnt take it up the bottom then
MMA,not_removed,those two have a beef with everyone
MMA,not_removed,cyborg didnt make the list or did the fortune cookie she sent ronda remove her from it
MMA,not_removed,i still cant believe people thought ronda could fight mayweather lmao
MMA,not_removed,her one that got away brendan schuab
MMA,not_removed,the girl she lost to in the olympics edith bosch
MMA,not_removed,yeah we just have to wait and see after the fight how she is
MMA,not_removed,fair but encouraging suicide is a shitty thing to do regardless of your standing in society
MMA,not_removed,you said you hope she jumps off of a bridge you didnt hurt my feelings i dont like rhonda rousey but i like people who come on this sub spewing hateful bullshit even less
MMA,not_removed,it
MMA,not_removed,i laugh everytime
MMA,not_removed,didnt cyborg recently say about ronda i bet she doesnt shadow box because the shadow would probably win
MMA,not_removed,i have an irrational hatred for that second guy surely hes doing a bit
MMA,not_removed,holy shit thats gold
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,at one point she moves her hips in the opposite direction shes punching fucking hell
MMA,not_removed,its because theyre arm punches that theyre so bad right
MMA,not_removed,oh god ohgod thats the worst one ive seen yet by far everything from her arms to her handsnice little flick at the end of every punch to her movement to whatever she was doing with her head
MMA,not_removed,most infectious laugh in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,i love this one makes me laugh every time
MMA,not_removed,i heard from a guy who knows a guy that ronda is furious with leclassman for questioning her acting abilities
MMA,not_removed,you just made the list buddeh
MMA,not_removed,not even tina feys writing can make ronda tolerable
MMA,not_removed,neal degrasse tyson lol
MMA,not_removed,no need to go out of ufc gsp one of the nicest guys in mma wonderboy mighty mouse demian maia all fucking geniuses being a nice person or an awful person is a choice
MMA,not_removed,he said name one you lose
MMA,not_removed,in think the general feeling is amanda will come in hard and that is perfect for rousey
MMA,not_removed,i think ronda is much much better on the ground watch nunes vs cat not even mins in cat has her locked in a tight armbar if that was ronda the fight would be over cat had no trouble controlling her on the ground for the entire round too and landed some great ground and pound and then she easily got her down again in the and finished her amanda does have great power for the division so i could see a scenario where she catches ronda early and drops her sure
MMA,not_removed,okay well lets have a look at actual match up by looking at actual tendencies of fighters rousey charges forward and is ideally looking to clinch up with her opponents throw and finish every fight is pretty much the same she s going in guns blazing every time aiming to end up in that clinch holly had the skill to neutralise this by playing the matador snapping off tight crisp shots to honda until she was just a broken shell of a champ amanda is one who is very happy to throw hands a little recklessly and ends up in the clinch a lot its not like rousey is going to get kod instantly so more than likely amanda is going to end up in the clinch with ronda anyone who stays in the clinch with ronday is getting thrown and then youve got an olympian judoka pinning you punching you and ultimately finishing you its a pretty shocking match up for rousey but i hope to make good money on betting on her
MMA,not_removed,being aggressive has never and will never work against ronda the only times opponents have had any sort of success against her is when they make ronda be the aggressor being aggressive against a judo player let alone ronda fn rousey is a bad idea
MMA,not_removed,nunes is a bjj black belt and is a brown belt in judo
MMA,not_removed,joe owns a stake in onnit thats onnit they sell kettle bells shaped like primates and maybe some other shit i dont know and plugs it all the time on his podcast hes also been wearing some of their shirts at ufc weigh ins and things
MMA,not_removed,these are jokes at rondas expense because during the staredown with holly she was all agro and managed to punch herself in the face with hollys fist the whole time holly being unfazed and collected so then she went on instagram and ranted about holly being a fake ass bitch ass whatever somebody will have a link for you im sure
MMA,not_removed,exactly everyone is deserving of empathy not necessarily forgivenessacceptance its a happier world when people cut each other some slack when its appropriate
MMA,not_removed,black and white like when you said she had a bad childhood and blamed her mom ronda wasnt just unstable she was an asshole to those she beat and those who never did anything to her
MMA,not_removed,at the end of the day we are ultimately responsible for our actions caveat not the legally insane bad backgroundsrough upbringings give you an understanding as to how someone got to be where they are and should mitigate punishment but that individual eventually bad a choice no one else
MMA,not_removed,but for me and a lot of people out there i think its less about her instability and more about lack of maturity and bitchiness
MMA,not_removed,it would be different if she was unfortunate although her upbringing may not be what we would think of as nice she has been silver spooned as an adult she has the money to get help if she wants she can afford lavish food and shelter it is on her
MMA,not_removed,who doesnt though
MMA,not_removed,he liked wearing the khabib hat
MMA,not_removed,got em
MMA,not_removed,well yeah but so did the entire mma community
MMA,not_removed,she would be a disaster on wwe programming unless heyman did all the taking while she mean mugged
MMA,not_removed,broken ronda
MMA,not_removed,hondas mom used it to teach her not to tap to chokes
MMA,not_removed,httpiimgurcomugokdgif
MMA,not_removed,mr f
MMA,not_removed,or they just saw it havent thought it over and want to talk about it
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i thought that part of his training was you were suppose to believe the earth was flat
MMA,not_removed,you called
MMA,not_removed,i feel like the number of people that believe is an inside job is surprisingly high i remember that whole thing that went down with wikileaks and the state party or whatever in that thread was a whole bunch of people speculating they must have gotten a hold of information proving bush was behind
MMA,not_removed,all i could find was like infowars articles they reference jre episode but i couldnt find her talking about it edit timestamp she mentions it once briefly but doesnt go into it
MMA,not_removed,ive watched this loop like a thousand times its perfect
MMA,not_removed,i mean if youre smart but so mentally unstable you do a lot of really dumb stuff anyway is there really any difference
MMA,not_removed,shes a badass and if she figures out the cardio issue she will be a dominant force
MMA,not_removed,girl cant even throw a jab correctly
MMA,not_removed,ð
MMA,not_removed,yeah she used an ali quote
MMA,not_removed,to be fair carey has a pretty stiff doublejab there keeping his right hand up to protect the face the right cross needs a little work but a few months with edmond should straighten him right out
MMA,not_removed,horrible technique basically when shadow boxing your arms should be loose
MMA,not_removed,sounds pretty par for the course these days with ronda
MMA,not_removed,it manifests in different ways though gsp may be lovely but he himself admits that he is not a how do we say neuronormative person
MMA,not_removed,the question was crazy not mean gsp isor was all kinds of crazy he just seems able to channel it
MMA,not_removed,ronda beats up tate but tate beat holm its not a simple equation
MMA,not_removed,they sell shit like brain enhancement pills lol
MMA,not_removed,i understand that but i didnt understand why someone said fake onnit
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwinstagramcompdmacahesqhlen there ya go
MMA,not_removed,how do you know she hasnt been on medshasnt been to therapy etc youre just assuming that or coming to that conclusion because she hasnt publicly admitted it or denied it and even if she denied it thats a hell of a thing to admit to as a megafamous professional fighter if i was on meds as someone in that position id probably keep it to myself nobodys fucking business but mine and id rather avoid the endless ridicule and harassment from a bunch of keyboard warriors who have never spent a nanosecond in their lives feeling an ounce of sympathy for anybody with mental health
MMA,not_removed,youre assuming she hasnt attempted to find help given her past and her mothers background i feel she likely has not all problems are easily resolved just because of your age years in therapy also being a world class athlete for years leaves little room for mental selfimprovement so even if she is getting help its likely not on par with someone who lives a more normal life i believe not sure by any means so i apologize if im wrong but i believe ronda has some form of aspergers her mother has said that she couldnt speak until almost and given the other things we know of her this makes sense
MMA,not_removed,hes a legit fighter for sure but the way people talk about him they make it seem like he will never be beat i favor mcgregor and tony ferguson beating him
MMA,not_removed,i know i was just saying that in reference to your mention of unconditional loyalty its likely that her moms own teaching is what keeps ronda from listening to her now
MMA,not_removed,her mum was saying very clearly that being coached by edmond was bad for her before her loss to holly very different then if shed piped up afterwards
MMA,not_removed,armbar city bitch
MMA,not_removed,well shes good at that
MMA,not_removed,yeah charlotte flair is a better actor than her
MMA,not_removed,should have taught her to block kicks instead
MMA,not_removed,why do you feel it is surprisingly high its not like the united states government hasnt tried to do something like before httpsenwikipediaorgwikioperationnorthwoods
MMA,not_removed,she tweeted some stuff
MMA,not_removed,to the public no to the individual yes
MMA,not_removed,thats my biggest fear about this fight it gets to the round and both are going full
MMA,not_removed,ali ruined boxing with his wwe shit s
MMA,not_removed,report mean furious movie set to be scrapped due to studios concerns that ronda cant act
MMA,not_removed,memes shes furious
MMA,not_removed,direct to dvd maybe
MMA,not_removed,nootropics are not brain enhancement pills lol
MMA,not_removed,ronda httpswwwinstagramcompdmacahesqhlen holly on ig after the ufc weighin and it became a meme
MMA,not_removed,you wont find fully qualified psychologistspsychiatrists in rmma my friend one thing ive learned as i grow up is that we all do it at different ages be it etc its not an easy thing to do and it cant be forced on anyone all these steps of seeking help and all that all come with growing up and life experience unfortunately i dont think rondas there but i hope she gets there its a horrible thing to be trapped in your own skin like her and id only assume shes surrounded by like minded people edmund its like a festering pot at that stage if youre going to take anything away from reading this nonsense or witnessing rondas open up expose yourself to the opposite of what you think and empathize with it were all people and wed all choose to be loved and to love without fear if we could
MMA,not_removed,i thought he was going to maul mcgregor until and seeing both of their fights i still think he beats ferguson though
MMA,not_removed,the proposals were rejected by the kennedy administration
MMA,not_removed,theyre not im seriously asking this is what wikipedia says about them nootropics âalso called smart drugs or cognitive enhancersâare drugs supplements or other substances that improve cognitive function particularly executive functions memory creativity or motivation
MMA,not_removed,onnit markets their insanely over priced nootropics literally as brain enhancement pills they are selling magic beans their clinical trials dont support a fiftieth of what joe rogan casually says during the podcast they arent even somewhat competitively priced i mean dont take my word for it just buy some on the odd chance they seem worth it to you research it and buy a generic version on amazon and then try to convince yourself its worth the price difference
MMA,not_removed,bullshit pills would be a better term
MMA,not_removed,well some nootropics do enhance brain functionality
MMA,not_removed,cat fight
MMA,not_removed,dude youre assuming she hasnt attempted to get help before or hasnt been in therapyon meds thats what your words are leading me to assume im saying she very well might have repeatedly and just doesnt want to disclose it publicly if shes willing to admit publicly that shes depressed and has been suicidal recently that makes it even more likely and just because she seems like shes backsliding or not stable right now doesnt mean she hasnt gotten help in the past thats the nature of mental illness its a constant fight you dont just step into a therapy office pop a pill and walk off into the sunset thats not how reality works unfortunately
MMA,not_removed,im a couple hundered hours away from my mft credentials does that count
MMA,not_removed,yeah but besides that
MMA,not_removed,without making any implications on gulf of tonkin was a thing
MMA,not_removed,multivitamins for your brain
MMA,not_removed,honestly its hard to not describe them as brain enhancersjoe said before that its like food for the brain which makes it sound like brain enhancers
MMA,not_removed,fake ass cheap shotting fake respect fake humility bitch ucockblockbyjesus my ass i see through your fake sweet act now youre getting your ass kicked tomorrow and im really going to enjoy the beating i give you andstill
MMA,not_removed,this might be the only footage of mayhem that i have seen that makes me say poor mayhem
MMA,not_removed,looking at all the old videos of mayhem having fun and being a cool charismatic guy makes me say poor mayhem i think fighting and winning was his sort of support that kept him stable
MMA,not_removed,that press tour was amazing i probably watched the series about times
MMA,not_removed,easily the most anticipated fight ever the nerves and tension leading into this fight were the craziest id ever experienced as an mma fan
MMA,not_removed,crazy time to be a fan
MMA,not_removed,this moment is so perfect mcgregor put up his feet baited jose to do it then grabbed the belt fucking slick af
MMA,not_removed,conor mcgregor is a special human being
MMA,not_removed,i hope someday we get another world tour that was as exciting as this
MMA,not_removed,i was there weirdest loudest craziest presser ive been at sadly there were quite a few unsavoury irish fans
MMA,not_removed,i remember being so salty as a huge aldo fan but this was bananas live
MMA,not_removed,ah man i was there for this was nuts the who are ya chant that starts when jose enters still makes me laugh
MMA,not_removed,yeah i thought i was gonna die of a heart attack during the walkouts i was telling everyone around me how aldo was going to win
MMA,not_removed,combat sports mate ive been to small and large events all over the world combat sports fans are easily categorized the purists who will dress up for even the worst occasions the casuals who are there to start their night out and bullys who like to identify themselves with the winners and often hurl abuse at the losers
MMA,not_removed,i love the conors gonna get ye chant
MMA,not_removed,me too there were guys in front of me who were kind of displeased with how the crowd were treating aldo being that hes such a legend of the sport most people were just relentlessly abusing him but when conor grabbed the belt those same guys were all aboard with the mob screaming youre a dead man aldo beautiful stuff
MMA,not_removed,aww man that had to have been rough im a conor fan but im not heartless all i wanted was conor not to get embarrassed when the fight was over i didnt feel elation i felt relief if conor had lost in that way to jose the fallout would have sucked people would have been all over mcgregor i feel for ya
MMA,not_removed,and then it went silent so young nate the great could ask some questions it was surreal i went up and asked aldo about going up to lw and was telling the lad behind me to fuck off so i could finish my question
MMA,not_removed,if you ever do feel bad about the crowd take solace that the shit that happens with brazilian crowds is a million times worse
MMA,not_removed,can percent relate this is the easily the hardest thing about being a mcgregor fan he builds up the stakes so high you just dont want him to embarrass himself ð done well so far anyway the guy has nerves of steel in the octagon
MMA,not_removed,after posting this i realised that is his documentary notorious he done with irish broadcaster rtÃ© just renamed
MMA,not_removed,that aint his real youtube channel either his is themaclife
MMA,not_removed,i was thinking that it couldnt be due to the lack of subscribers ive seen a few mma news outlets actually say this is his official channel though i think ive been goofed
MMA,not_removed,naturally people will think that because its verified for some odd reason but then his actual legit one isnt youtube is just a fuckery all together
MMA,not_removed,is this just you sharing articles other people wrote to spark a discussion that format will never work
MMA,not_removed,i vomited just looking at that page
MMA,not_removed,good luck lol
MMA,not_removed,any support is appreciated
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,i still find it crazy how the the first fw champ who was undefeated for years did not get an instant rematch
MMA,not_removed,itt nothing new
MMA,not_removed,as long as aldos head is not ringing from that knock out i dont think this fight is going to be even close he really wants that rematch
MMA,not_removed,yet conor deserves a rematch for a pointless fight not a huge aldo fan but wtf
MMA,not_removed,deserved a rematch yes but we all know how works around here like jose though we should all just move forward
MMA,not_removed,champions mentality war aldo
MMA,not_removed,a step as a rematch a step down for a rematch with cub frankie is taking this one
MMA,not_removed,seems like everyone is already counting aldo out people forget how good of a fighter he is
MMA,not_removed,conor will never fight at again this fight is for the championship
MMA,not_removed,connor is never never going to defend the belt he wont be able to cut back to he might say he will and a fight will get announced but he wont make the weight
MMA,not_removed,and conor burried him heeeyoo
MMA,not_removed,with all the ped suspicions and soreness in losing im not sure how i feel about this guy anymore hes certainly one of the greatest fighters in the history of the sport but not a man i necessarily like
MMA,not_removed,technically years if you count his wec days
MMA,not_removed,they did two world tours since aldo got injured before the first scheduled bout my guess was they didnt want to rehash the whole thing again
MMA,not_removed,they shouldnt do any rematches at all to be honest they only did the previous ones because they were cash grabs by aldo is not popular diaz v mcgregor would still sell more
MMA,not_removed,wasnt he offered a rematch after rda pulled out he didnt take it and the fight was offered to diaz iirc
MMA,not_removed,the reason there was not a rematch was because conor pursued becoming a two division champion holding two belts at the same time it was history in the making and much more money for the ufc
MMA,not_removed,money mcgregor brings it
MMA,not_removed,its not the money fight thats really all that matters
MMA,not_removed,being a dominant champ is not virtue enough by itself to deserve an instant rematch
MMA,not_removed,if a match is close to a draw with a dominant champion losing that is the only case where a rematch should be given other times that make sense is if there are no other contenders at that time but no reason to tie up a division for rematches when they arent earned
MMA,not_removed,a fresh aldo was beating edgar to the punch every time last fight i think aldo can decisively take rounds again
MMA,not_removed,i think frankie is going to stop him
MMA,not_removed,yeah cause frankie brings nothing to the table its not like their first fight ended in a close decision edgar will destroy him
MMA,not_removed,this is mma its not about merit its about money
MMA,not_removed,yeah but conors obsessed s
MMA,not_removed,yeah but the fight will sell huge and their fight lasted more than seconds and was a close and interesting fight aldo also pulled out of their first fight and almost fucked up the card and then went out there and lost in near record time the second time around so ufc had world tours for seconds of fighting thanks to aldo fuckin up connor is also looking to move up to anyway and its hard to sell an rda vs connor fight when connor just lost to a guy that rda demolished so its important that he shows the loss was a fluke or its hard to sell him moving up and he seems to have alot of trouble making so he probably needs to i think he probably should have given up the title tho after the nate loss i dont think its a pointless rematch i think people here just like to be anti casual mma fan opinion to show theyre hardcore or something retarded
MMA,not_removed,took him and a half months
MMA,not_removed,if conor loses to nate again i dont see him going anywhere else but back to unless he starts from the bottom of the ladder a rematch with poirier doesnt sound too bad
MMA,not_removed,i somehow doubt that im pretty sure he could get down to that weight hes done it before why cant he do it again sure its hard but he can do it if he actually wants to go back down is another question
MMA,not_removed,ped suspicions
MMA,not_removed,as long as you dislike conor too it makes sense
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor gets the rematch because he saved the companies ass twice in a row while being the face of the sport and did them countless favours aldo doesnt because theres a significant chance of not making it too fights not being able to sell said fight and above all because he shit on the ufc for years until it was time to ask for a favour its actually not unbelievable at all in fact its very believable
MMA,not_removed,aldo said he would only accept a second fight with mcgregor for his next fight and nothing else and that he would fight him anywhere any time aldo was then offered the rematch when rda pulled out and he declined and then accepted a fight with frankie diaz stepped in to save the card and because diaz had been on vacation the fight was made at instead of the it would have been against rda simple facts aldo had his opportunity for a rematch with mcgregor for his next fight back and he turned the offer down
MMA,not_removed,damn that is impressive
MMA,not_removed,hasnt been beat since he was a teenager
MMA,not_removed,that and the whole seconds outcome i like aldo but its difficult to sell that rematch especially since aldo is not as popular in america most instant rematches at least go a couple of rounds
MMA,not_removed,aldo is pretty damn popular one of best known fighters in mma and a legend
MMA,not_removed,diaz v mcgregor fify
MMA,not_removed,they offered it to a bunch of guys from what i heard and aldo was out of shape since he was koed and couldnt really train and was out of shape is how i interpreted
MMA,not_removed,he just finished his medical suspension so could not fight it
MMA,not_removed,this is basically it lesser deserving former champs were given instant rematches
MMA,not_removed,years a champ is outlier dominant loss deserves a rematch
MMA,not_removed,so when anderson the for years lost to weidman by ko that didnt warrant a rematch should rondas first fight back not be for the title if jon jones loses to dc will that not warrant a rematch for fucks sake conor got an instant rematch after getting his ass handed to him by nate this sport has outliers and superstarsits built on that that factor special treatment rightfully happens especially if youve earned that right through years of work its why a guy is even being considered for a championship fight at middleweight if youre michael bisping or luke rockhold and youve lost the belt without defending it then obviously you dont deserve an instant rematch but if youre one of the goats of your division have literally been the only champion in your weight class have multiple ufc records and havent lost in yearsyeah i think you have to give that an instant rematch especially with the precedent they set with anderson mcgregor barao and the one theyre setting with rondas first fight back
MMA,not_removed,but realistically that is what the ufc has done for nearly every champ even champs that dont move the needle per se eg barao
MMA,not_removed,why do people keep saying this their first fight didnt end in a close decision it was aldo
MMA,not_removed,ended in a close decision what fight did you watch rounds to aldo
MMA,not_removed,make ene
MMA,not_removed,even if conor iswas obsessed it doesnt take away the title defences aldo had in the ufc plus the two in wec
MMA,not_removed,i strongly believe that if you get beaten by a man who didnt have a traning camp in the second round via rnc you should not get an instant rematch when conor fought nate nate beat him everywhere conor had nothing else to offer conor was gassed out and was about to be kod the aldo conor fight ended within seconds so that alone should be enough to justify a rematch after seeing conor lose to nate i was expecting to see nate get a title shot at and conor facing aldo in a rematchthen if conor beats aldo he wouldve got another go at the title which conor has a much higher chance in winning when compared to the nate rematch i think theres a real high chance of conor being kod in the nate rematch lets not act as if conor didnt save himself by shooting for the takedown he shot for that sloppy takedown for a reason every fight is different but i do not see conor beating diaz conor said that he felt diaz was almost done after a left hand but why didnt conor finish him
MMA,not_removed,are you suggesting he should have came back sooner after being knocked out cold because thats ridiculous
MMA,not_removed,yeah i would watch that rematch
MMA,not_removed,poirier is hardly the bottom of the ladder
MMA,not_removed,because he is putting on more weight to fight a bigger person im willing to bet you nate had to cut some weight to make the catch weight last time im willing to put money conner does not defend the belt
MMA,not_removed,im not making shit up here
MMA,not_removed,since the new regulations last year many brazilian fighters havent looked as goodwith exception so some people are putting together and speculating that they are all on peds since brazil didnt have as strict relations as the us
MMA,not_removed,why
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor gets the rematch because he saved the companies ass twice in a row while being the face of the sport and did them countless favours and when ufc balked and rewarded him his little rematch he decided to show his appreciation by flat out reneging on his obligations to merely participate in prefight promotions and events in the biggest cardevent in the history of the company and probably to the point of whining about retirement wasting all of the resources ufc has already pour into market ufc so far at that point
MMA,not_removed,wasnt he injured when the mcgregorrda fight fell through
MMA,not_removed,i feel like the second outcome is even more of a reason to run it again rematches should be made for bad decisions frankiebj close decisions frankiemaynard and legendary fighters who got caught andersonweidman just what i think should qualify rematches a better example could probably be found
MMA,not_removed,he has one of the lowest ppv buyrates of champions even in brazil hes barely above demetrious johnson
MMA,not_removed,in a niche circle ask the layman and most wont know him and from the ones that do hell be the guy that irish fighter kod in seconds
MMA,not_removed,also wasnt a champ for years
MMA,not_removed,weak division that is why faber just got another crack at cruz
MMA,not_removed,barao didnt get an immediate rematch though he had one fight inbetween which is the same treatment aldo is getting
MMA,not_removed,although theres an argument to be made for too to be honest it wasnt particularly close as aldo dominated for the first three rounds when he began to fade edgar began scoring a lot more as he has endless cardio if someone finishes stronger as edgar did it can leave a more lasting impression on people i suppose it was definitely aldos toughest fight excluding aldomendes
MMA,not_removed,probably love for one hatred for the other similar to jones and dc dc by no means got his ass kicked but it was and not as competitive as people make it out to be
MMA,not_removed,this is why the sig strikes were close and in the last edgar landed more
MMA,not_removed,their first fight was close not a close decision because of the silly scoring system used in mma
MMA,not_removed,nope suggesting that he shouldnt have been crying for months on end saying it wasnt a fight perhaps you should look at the comment i am replying to and not the topic
MMA,not_removed,have it in a real country too fuck ireland
MMA,not_removed,but then again they wouldnt make conor fight the actual bottom of the ladder
MMA,not_removed,neither have american fighters weidman looked like a damn welterweight against rockhold
MMA,not_removed,because hes showed equal amounts of ped suspiciousness and soreness in losing
MMA,not_removed,nate nates coaches aldo and tate were saying the iceland thing was because he couldnt get tested there
MMA,not_removed,and when ufc balked and rewarded him his little rematch his rematch is anything but little mate it could be bigger than ufc it could be the highest selling ufc ppv in history very poor choice of words there and irrespective of what happened after the announcement the facts are still the facts on why he was given the rematch
MMA,not_removed,facts your opinion my opinion of conor or your opinion of aldo have little to do with the reality of the situation thats transpired and why it happened that way edit and your inability to separate your personal feelings from the facts to attack me for pointing them out is hilarious equally so all the people in here who agree with you get over yourselves
MMA,not_removed,no that was frankie aldo specifically said anytime anywhere and that will be training for mcgregor in case rda polls out
MMA,not_removed,he wasnt injured but conor would never had been able or willing to cut for so a title shot would have been impossible aldo might have been asked if he wanted to fight at but why the fuck would he want to anyone who thinks he ducked conor is a moron
MMA,not_removed,well it was too soon i think after getting his brain rattled by conor and even mcgregor said the same that he should take more time to recover before coming back getting kod like that is no joke it isnt wise for any fighter to come back too soon after a ko so that brings up the fw title defense that everyone complains about really frankie should have got the fight with mcgrogor for the fw title but the ufc wanted to give him the shot at the lw belt because of the money aside from frankie there wasnt much for him at fw until everyone had time i guess you could argue for a holloway rematch though so as conor stays active and the ufc wants to milk him for as much money as they can they made a fight he lost that fight and because of everything hes done for the company they gave him another shot at diaz and the turn around has been pretty fast so its kind of disengenous to make out like mcgregor has been away a long long time holding up the division not willing to defend his belt etc aldo only defended about once a year with no other fights inbetween
MMA,not_removed,you are so unbelievably right but in all honesty most people cant get past the thirteen seconds from a selling perspective many look at it as the shorter the fight the more clear cut it was that mcgregor was the better fighter
MMA,not_removed,i agree at the very least the pettisrda dillashawbarao cainwerdum are those that do not warrant an immediate rematch
MMA,not_removed,you mean frankie v maynard that was the close one they fought times frankie vs bj penn should probably get lumped under close fights and not bad decisions other than that cheers just to name some other close controversial ones machida v shogun gus v jones gsp v hendricks both hendricks v lawyer fights shogun hendo
MMA,not_removed,i dont think he disagrees with you i think he just feels that its unsellable to a public that doesnt know aldos history rda made more sense and then the cluster fuck with diaz happened and now the public wants that fight
MMA,not_removed,ok but he is well known
MMA,not_removed,i think he is a lot better known than what you are implying he is pretty well known
MMA,not_removed,he hadnt lost a single fight in years since he won the wec belt hes been on an fight win streak try to think about that for a second the wec had the best in the world and when it merged with the ufc the ufc had the best in the world and when youre champ you realistically have to fight a top guy every single fight not only did aldo win all of those fights he dominated them dominating a top guy in your division for straight fights is one of the rarest things you could do in this sport the names belong in that group anderson silva jon jones gsp the goats of this sport you seem to not find aldo or his accolades very impressive but aldo is on that list
MMA,not_removed,shows how much they buy into bullshit
MMA,not_removed,that is people counting the wec title run
MMA,not_removed,check yo facts
MMA,not_removed,that wasnt the reason they gave the instant rematch they gave it because barao was the long reigning champion and considered one of the pound for pound best and the division isnt that weak also there is a laundry list of champs that got instant rematches weidman cain hendricks
MMA,not_removed,he did get an immediate rematch he passed out before weigh ins and couldnt make the fight tj had to fight a last minute replacement it was ufc
MMA,not_removed,heres a guy who actually remembers how the fight went down score wouldnt have been an outrage either but youre right about the championship rounds leaving a lasting impression on people also i think people are riding high on edgar right now and low on aldo anything can happen in a rematch of course but saying their first fight was close is simply not true and i keep seeing it everywhere
MMA,not_removed,it was aldos fight no doubt i scored it myself i believe but i dont think that means edgar cant win the rematch personally im taking frankie this time i can see why aldo is many peoples pick but personally im sticking with edgar this time around ive thought hed take jose in a rematch since he fought cub swanson
MMA,not_removed,no thats a copout mma is the worst sport to use stats for there are too many x factors watching the fight tells a completely different story aldo clearly won the first rounds clearly lost the and won the in a very close round that you can easily argue for frankie but thats really all there is to it the fight itself wasnt very close at all it really comes down to whether frankie won one round or two
MMA,not_removed,yea totally who needs to watch the fight just read the metrics and youll tell who won facepalm
MMA,not_removed,not really there were no imo and if there were they were for aldo frankie won round and you can maybe argue he won round but neither were super dominant rounds before the championship rounds frankie was getting worked i think is the right call
MMA,not_removed,it was a mistranslation iirc
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,mendes also looked smaller against edgar
MMA,not_removed,which is absolute rubbish its factually wrong the testing centre is a minute drive from the gym
MMA,not_removed,ah yes the anti conor brigade have been resigned to argue with you via insults and downvotes as is tradition
MMA,not_removed,yeah but the fight would be in lightweight why would aldo accept a lw rematch there is no point in that
MMA,not_removed,aldo defended twice in twice in and twice in i know its a common misconception that aldo didnt fight that often but aldo was a pretty active champion even with his injuries
MMA,not_removed,a lot of downvotes you guys really disagree that frankie should have got the shot at fw against conor i thought that was a popular opinion around here frankie has been screwed over by the ufc for a while now just because he isnt a big draw or a shit talker
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats such a weird logic like we havent even seen if mcgregor can win a round against aldo obviously wasnt a fluke victory but not a this fighter is for sure better victory
MMA,not_removed,and sadly in two of your three examples an instant rematch was made
MMA,not_removed,thanks those are all great corrections and examples my keyboard warrior iq isnt what it use to be
MMA,not_removed,aldo is a beast im not denying it but factually speaking he wasnt a champ for years
MMA,not_removed,thats still less than years as a champ
MMA,not_removed,he won the wec title in he lost the ufc title in thats years not even close to
MMA,not_removed,the division iswas that weak at the top they did give the others rematches but the reason for barao was the weak division
MMA,not_removed,ahhh i wasnt aware of that fair enough
MMA,not_removed,so in terms of rounds isnt close to you he also took aldo down twice threw a shit ton of leg kicks dude i watched the fight it wasnt an easy one for aldo and edgar is doing pretty good right now its so stupid to say easy win for aldo you dont even know what his chin is like right now its frankies fight to win aldos fight to prove hes still there
MMA,not_removed,yes according to the current silly scoring system in which theres no difference between the score for a round of circling engagements and no significant strikes versus a back and forth where one opponent clearly lands more strikes but doesnt get a knockdown to one where a beatdown takes place like rockholdweidman and the judges still dont think is warranted as it was only the final minute of the round hence silly scoring system
MMA,not_removed,and mendes popped recently
MMA,not_removed,his physique has changed way more than aldos and in short periods of time theres not much to explain months is barely even time and he made big leaps physically hes doing cardio for multiple hours a day
MMA,not_removed,i told you exactly why he was given the rematch irrespective of its validity compared to why aldo was not given the rematch again irrespective of its validity instead of seeing past your personal bias you attacked me for stating the reality of the situation
MMA,not_removed,i think they would both prefer it as they have similar weight cuts especially if it was short notice
MMA,not_removed,how many seconds must a fight go for it to tell you a fighter is better is rda definitely better than cowboy is stipe definitely better than werdum is ronda definitely better than bethe
MMA,not_removed,i think a lot of people want to believe that the bout was a fluke because of how incredible the victory was and who it was against if the result was the same in reverse no one would be looking for a rematch no one looked for a rematch for cub against josÃ© and that was the definition of getting caught cold the problem was how the ko came if aldo and conor were in a wild exchange and conor caught him with wild shot say like how hendo caught lombard then the rematch could be sold but aldo was walled onto a counter punch in the opening secs he didnt look like he was unlucky in the exchange he just looked he was set up by conor and out skilled its just a really hard sell you know all the public remembers is that sequence which doesnt sell aldos brand very well
MMA,not_removed,aldo threw a combo weve seen from him before only difference is connor had the tool set to punish it clearly the better fighter
MMA,not_removed,he probably meant undefeated for years which is the fact that gets thrown around with aldo
MMA,not_removed,well people are stupid because that was what i saw on here
MMA,not_removed,ok fine undefeated for years out of being champ
MMA,not_removed,it isntwasnt as weak as any other division in the ufc outside of that it is completely subjective what a weak strong division is the ufc has had a long running stance of giving longmid reigning champs instant rematch especially to those that were taken out due to flash knockouts aldo is the one outlier to that situation
MMA,not_removed,yeah it was a weird set of circumstances i dont think i have ever seen anything like that before or since
MMA,not_removed,hold up i never said this is an easy win for aldo im very much of the opinion that this rematch is the most important fight of his career thus far youre confusing me with op all i was saying was that their first fight really wasnt close in terms of rounds might sound close but thats being generous in reality the judges scored it for aldo and i didnt think it was a close fight there was no question or doubt in my mind when it went to a decision that aldo would win
MMA,not_removed,ignore scoring systems altogether forget about the score watch aldofrankie again and youre telling me thats a close fight its really not and if there was a scoring system that scores that fight close or for frankie then that would be a truly silly scoring system
MMA,not_removed,lol show me a picture of his massive transformation
MMA,not_removed,you just explained how he made the transformation hours of cardio a day
MMA,not_removed,nuthugger confirmed lol what how the hell are you going to argue that as fact and not an assumption im looking forward to this
MMA,not_removed,but no belt in line aldo wants his belt back
MMA,not_removed,mma isnt an exact science but there are definitely situations where we can gather more evidence to make an argument aldo has been at the top for so long that we can safely say he is one of the most skilled fighters ever mcgregor has also proven himself as an extremely skilled fighter i just dont think the seconds of their fight tell nearly the story about how they compare to each other all the fights you mentioned we have much more evidence to make a case than this one well aside from werdum stipe bc heavyweight tends to defy logic again it was a well deserved victory by mcgregor just not a very informative one
MMA,not_removed,come on man rda beat cowboy twice and miocic werdum went like half a round atleast
MMA,not_removed,not sure of the exact number but it usually goes beyond one punch lol especially when you know the caliber of the person who got knocked out in that one punch
MMA,not_removed,yeah i dont think an immediate rematch was necessarily warranted just a more general comment on what those kinds of fights mean i get equally bothered when people call it a fluke victory because there was nothing really abnormal about the finish
MMA,not_removed,yeah except bandwagoners who havent so much as read his wikipedia page contort that into a year championship reign
MMA,not_removed,who cares maybe you should check your own facts before you start spouting bandwagon bullshit
MMA,not_removed,one judge it but it is a moot point i dont think edgar got robbed but it was close and in mma weve seen some wacky decisions im just surprised that op not you sorry seems to be counting edgar out
MMA,not_removed,ive not seen it since a rewatch a month after it happened so will yield on this
MMA,not_removed,lol im not gonna bother just go on his instagram
MMA,not_removed,he was doing hours of cardio while bulking up too
MMA,not_removed,actually with some reading comprehension on your part i said because he saved the companies ass twice in a row which is an indisputable fact your failure to grasp this has shown massive ignorance on your part
MMA,not_removed,i agree with you that the difference between the fighters was not captured in that bout but how do you sell it to the general public there was one sequence be sides probing shots from mcgregor and it just showed a massive gulf in ability not saying there is a massive gulf in ability just that the general public who watched mma for the first time that night will think there is
MMA,not_removed,okay what about ronda vs zingano and ronda vs davis how are we supposed to tell that ronda is better than them if she finished them in and seconds respectively
MMA,not_removed,wow angry much
MMA,not_removed,yea i dont have to bc there was no transformation your just dumb
MMA,not_removed,he ate three desserts the day before his fight you realize its possible to gain weight while doing cardio right
MMA,not_removed,i wasnt talking about your comment you spanner cant you read what i said hughied ah yes the anti conor brigade have been resigned to argue with you via insults and downvotes as is tradition i was referring to your retort strantron nutthuger confirmed i never once made a comment about your original post you plank i only made a comment about your brain dead response you know how the comment cascade model of reddit works right you know which comment im replying to because it appears immediately underneath it clearly i was referring to snarky remark and not youre original comment if you cant figure it out then you shouldnt be on here
MMA,not_removed,great example i am still curious how zingano couldve faired if she didnt charge her like a dingus to me that fight didnt tell the whole story again this is not an exact science there is no formula for any of this speculation and opinion is what we do here
MMA,not_removed,sure it is unlikely to make noticeable changes in months to an already trained guy and im not saying hes on peds simply that both have reasons to suspect them
MMA,not_removed,conor mcgregor accepted two short notice fights last minute on two events that were entirely about him both events ended up being massive ppvs totalling million ppv purchases if you honestly fail to grasp how that fact grants him favour with the ufc you are the only delusional person here and are realling showing your absolute ignorance or blind hatred of mcgregor whatever you prefer i cant be surprised though youve barely been on reddit months so i imagine you are new to the sport and only following all the other comments that you read
MMA,not_removed,youre lack of concise and accurate counterargument speaks far more than any votes lmfao tagged as a true moron
MMA,not_removed,it would seem you should enjoy the downvotes yourself as luke thomas would say you are a truly spectacular donk donkerson and maybe in the future you can appreciate exactly how dense you were in this thread the inability to separate your personal feelings from a rational discussion will do you no good in life
MMA,not_removed,nuts
MMA,not_removed,big bens pretty lucky to get this after getting absolutely dominated by jds
MMA,not_removed,ugh mcgregor vs diaz johnson vs teixeria story vs cerrone garbrandt vs mizugaki magny vs larkin is a card
MMA,not_removed,dude looks like amanda nunes
MMA,not_removed,a fitting prelim mainevent for the true ufc
MMA,not_removed,dope
MMA,not_removed,im really glad the ufc has really been pushing fight pass before any live fights were just seen as extra content couldnt take but over the last few months fight pass has been consistently getting great fights like these
MMA,not_removed,sick fight love watching both of these guys compete gotta pull for magny though
MMA,not_removed,my subscription expires in a few days and im too broke to renew it fuck
MMA,not_removed,sweet larkin vs magny
MMA,not_removed,wow thats a great fucking fight
MMA,not_removed,now thats a fucking fight
MMA,not_removed,i love this fight its gonna be a good one i think that magny will be the winner because the man always find a way he has been really active and gained a lot experience lately
MMA,not_removed,lorenz will win by dec glovier texeira will win by sub donald cerrone will win by tko garbant will win by dec conor will win by dec mark my words
MMA,not_removed,this fight is so good wonder how magny doesnt get mauled on the feet though
MMA,not_removed,yeah i have a feeling this is gonna be the event of the year so many exciting fighters
MMA,not_removed,and artem
MMA,not_removed,would have been unreal if they didnt move condit vs maia although it was a good decision
MMA,not_removed,i got magny by kotko garbrandt by kotko story by sub johnson by kotko diaz by being bigger and tougher and why the fuck did conor fight him again at the same weight after hes had a full camp and what the fuck man what the fuck
MMA,not_removed,take ur rose colored glasses off its a solid
MMA,not_removed,no way no title fight in a year where has become the norm good card entertaining for sure but it could have used a title fight or something more for bucks the whole conor thing wears thin once they dull down cards knowing his presence will be enough to smash records
MMA,not_removed,like nunes and carlton banks had a youngin
MMA,not_removed,god damn it i knew larkin looked like someone now ill forever see him as nunes
MMA,not_removed,cant unsee
MMA,not_removed,use a new email and do the free for the fight
MMA,not_removed,crazy that larkin isnt even ranked
MMA,not_removed,shame the main event will be finished within the first minute
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,event so good it has a designated mins for us to relax and laugh our asses off
MMA,not_removed,i think magny will get a decision its just rounds
MMA,not_removed,because imagine if conor wins i dont give a shit about who deserves to win i want back on the ridiculous hype train
MMA,not_removed,what
MMA,not_removed,what card has been better this year
MMA,not_removed,you cant use the same credit card twice can you
MMA,not_removed,ill bet you absolutely nothing at all that it will go longer
MMA,not_removed,youre on steroids
MMA,not_removed,sweet jeezus this sub is going to turn into a circus for the next days
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt count as a whole one
MMA,not_removed,if conor wins he gets brock next
MMA,not_removed,and for starters is debatable but at the very least in its original scheduling it was better the only knock was that it was headlined by an immediate rematch that some didnt want to see also looking stacked with a championship fight happening and to compare it to a real on pen and paper it holds absolutely nothing over the scheduled fights on or two other very good mcgregor cards very good fights but just because its great doesnt mean it has nearly no room to be improved upon someone like cruz dj or such would be a great realistic way to have given this card a little more without loading up on too much star power and blowing it on one card rather than spreading it out evenly over the year
MMA,not_removed,thats what they use to reduce abuse so thats no use
MMA,not_removed,dont know worth a shot thought use your atm
MMA,not_removed,i see your bet and raise you double diaz pops him inside the first minute diaz will be close to pounds mcgregor will be tops
MMA,not_removed,i tink it doesnt matta if hes on steriods
MMA,not_removed,was the only one in contention for it hasnt happened yet it could be the best night of fights weve ever seen
MMA,not_removed,the fight is and hes right now
MMA,not_removed,he walks around at and weighed in at last time goofball
MMA,not_removed,haha skinny ass diaz lbs sure
MMA,not_removed,let him roid up tell him to get comfortable
MMA,not_removed,the same could be said for potentially any card but on pen and paper it very much has room for improvement
MMA,not_removed,what are u talking about nate walks around at lbs
MMA,not_removed,bet you mcgregor comes in around
MMA,not_removed,ive come to learn that mma fans have absolutely no clue about heights weights or body fat percentages its embarrassing some times
MMA,not_removed,how do i do a remind me someone do it please lol
MMA,not_removed,lucky youre not betting real money otherwise youll be broke fast
MMA,not_removed,yoel fanboying out lol
MMA,not_removed,for those like me who were feeling disappointed at their lack of exposure during the press conference heres yoel and kelvin spending some time with new yorks soccer team during their stay there
MMA,not_removed,glad they got to speak to someone
MMA,not_removed,when kelvin is doing the selfie video in the beginning he says here with yoel the chosen one thats woodleys nickname i think he got them confused
MMA,not_removed,what are the chances we could get patrick vieira vs roy keane in the octagon at
MMA,not_removed,yoel seems like the nicest guy in the universe
MMA,not_removed,yoels such a cutie pie
MMA,not_removed,i like the chris but man yoel is so genuinely excited to meet his idols how would i not root for him go yoel
MMA,not_removed,my namesake
MMA,not_removed,yoel marking out for villa pirlo and viera haha even trying to hunt down lampard
MMA,not_removed,crazy to see yoel and viera in the same video was a big fan of viera and that arsenal team
MMA,not_removed,yoel is supper personable never knew
MMA,not_removed,i was wondering why yoel was such a fan since i thought cuba and baseball but then he said germany and i was oh yeah he trained there
MMA,not_removed,anyone else think yoel romero could be a model
MMA,not_removed,haha nice to see yoel fanboying out would be cool to see villa at the msg too
MMA,not_removed,nice to see what yoel is like as a normal human being seems like a decent guy in his cage post fight interviews hes fucking weird and unlikable
MMA,not_removed,vieras a big guyhow is he doing so far with the team
MMA,not_removed,asmr for days
MMA,not_removed,surrrrrrrrrr guuurrrrrrrrddd pirlo just wanted to train and vieira is massive holy shit
MMA,not_removed,yoel is as big as ever hope he beats the chris
MMA,not_removed,love yoel how can you not
MMA,not_removed,yoel is so dope not many cuban fighters in the game so im stoked to see him fight at
MMA,not_removed,yoel the god
MMA,not_removed,i dont know if anyone caught that but yoel said at it is an elimination for the title shot this obviously could mean nothing but it could mean winner of rockhold vs souza vs winner of weidman vs romero for the mw title shot
MMA,not_removed,vieira is a giant he looked huge even next to yoel
MMA,not_removed,i cant believe patrick vieira is still playing
MMA,not_removed,who gives a crud
MMA,not_removed,adorable
MMA,not_removed,for anyone who doesnt know andrea pirlo is one of the most legendary italian midfielders ever lampard is one of the most legendary english attacking midfielders and david villa was once one of the best spanish forwards in the world so anyone who is both a football and mma fan this is a pretty awesome video
MMA,not_removed,i honestly didnt like yoel that much until this video but wow hes so personable when he actually gets a chance i think ill be rooting for him against weidman
MMA,not_removed,i dont think theyd want to deal with having to clean the canvas after vieira shits himself at the prospect
MMA,not_removed,ive met him he was super nice to me
MMA,not_removed,his reaction to viera was gold haha
MMA,not_removed,even trying to hunt down lampard should have checked the cafeteria
MMA,not_removed,i miss those days
MMA,not_removed,i think you just came out the closet
MMA,not_removed,nycfc fan here in the east for a long stretch best away record in mls already clinched a playoff spot this is for a team that is only in its second year and was absolute garbage last season and is playing in an awkward small yankee stadium
MMA,not_removed,good clinched play offs and tied for in the east currently
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyxfcscoxqc
MMA,not_removed,yoel is god
MMA,not_removed,essentially people have kind of been seeing mw in this light since the fights were announced a sort of mini tournament
MMA,not_removed,hes the manager of nycfc retired quite a while ago
MMA,not_removed,for those who dont get itdownvoted
MMA,not_removed,is that you sage
MMA,not_removed,does the club have a lot of money or why would they play in the us
MMA,not_removed,super frank
MMA,not_removed,my brother walked into a gym where joel was training at here in miami small gym with a few guys he was talking to an older guy that seemed to be the manager of the place or maybe a trainer they were discussing prices to train and stuff and the guy was like id put you to spar with these guys and pointed and some young cats my brother says i want to fight him and points at joel my brother is one of those guys that jokes around but keeps a real straight face he tells me that the place got real quiet all of a sudden and joel got real fucking serious he came up to my brother and was like you want to fight me are you sure and my brother then was like na i was just fucking around and told him he was a big fan after that weirdness my brother says joel was very nice
MMA,not_removed,doesnt look to bad for us so far this season though walcott has been on fire the passed few games
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,oh im sorry
MMA,not_removed,yeah theyre all at the end of their careers the mls has been seen as a retirement league for big names for a while nycfc is owned by the same financial group as man city so i expect theyve got a fair bit of cash behind them
MMA,not_removed,conors a bigger sport than some people let on gained a bit more respect for him than i already hugely have also liked his honesty about how he needed the extra time when his diaz rematch was postponed
MMA,not_removed,i wish hed invite ronda to sbg goooood that would be epic
MMA,not_removed,people were making that interview out like he was just saying fuck everybody but that obviously isnt the case
MMA,not_removed,thats because hes gonna use it himself next time he negotiates a fight
MMA,not_removed,it would definitely be interesting to see ronda with roddy but ronda with any top striking coach would be good to see
MMA,not_removed,why they dont really produce great strikers conor is an anomaly that by all accounts brought his skills with him maybe crumlin boxing club is where she needs to be edit any downvoters care to explain im happy to change my mind
MMA,not_removed,well he put up a post to promote the interview that basically said fuck everyone so conors kinda responsible for that result
MMA,not_removed,yup connor is going to demand the ufc pay him for every media daypress conference he is forced to attend
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised
MMA,not_removed,you realize that if they get extra points per ppv buy it also hurts them to not do media
MMA,not_removed,who says she needs to learn how to strike like conor i think she needs to learn how to move her head and set up the clinch in a more modern way the sport evolved so much in the year that she was gone and its obvious that she didnt keep up also no matter who you are you cant say that conor was born with his skills that shit takes years to learn more to master he didnt just start doing those capoeira kicks when he was years old every part of his game has taken literally decades to progress and most of that time was spent in sbg so yeah they do produce good strikers
MMA,not_removed,every bit of media he does will be on ppv
MMA,not_removed,they do its part of his contract
MMA,not_removed,mother fuckers
MMA,not_removed,for someone like conor it really doesnt though same with rousey
MMA,not_removed,decade didnt he start boxingmma after quitting his role as an apprentice plumber around you cant deny that he was born with something special to have incredible timing precision and spatial awareness that most do not have conor is probably the best striker in the ufc roster at present
MMA,not_removed,well thats still an improvement over commenting after just reading the title on reddit
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i dont care how old he gets or how many shots he eats i reckon if i had a choice of any ufc fighter to help out in a bar brawl sanchez is up there
MMA,not_removed,hes a goofy character but ill miss him when he retires dying breed probably for the best
MMA,not_removed,rinstavidsthatendedtoosoon
MMA,not_removed,diego sanchez is the weirdest lad probably great to have around the gym
MMA,not_removed,he was about to go ham
MMA,not_removed,i dont see chris jericho here
MMA,not_removed,i fucking love diego sanchez
MMA,not_removed,you cant pick your own nickname donot call him by it
MMA,not_removed,jj is more of a rat
MMA,not_removed,god i want to make that my flair somehow
MMA,not_removed,rgifsthatendtoosoon
MMA,not_removed,when you nut and she keeps sucking
MMA,not_removed,id help him until he did something diego like taking a bite out of a beer bottle while yelling yes
MMA,not_removed,dude has no quit in him thats for damn sure as far as brawl buddies go though i gotta pick jds or hunt nigh impossible to ko with dynamite in their hands
MMA,not_removed,while i do love the technicality of the sport now i am gonna miss the crazy scrappy fucks that are there out of sheer toughness
MMA,not_removed,its real to me damnit
MMA,not_removed,youre weird
MMA,not_removed,diego sanchezyou just made the list
MMA,not_removed,do you know what happens when you call yourself the lion heart do you know what happens
MMA,not_removed,hell i would yell yes with him
MMA,not_removed,then koscheck comes out of nowhere and makes it worse by whispering diegothe aliens are coming
MMA,not_removed,dude are you kidding that would win you the fight right there people would just back away slowly
MMA,not_removed,rondaesque in his striking joe
MMA,not_removed,king
MMA,not_removed,i havent made my debut
MMA,not_removed,thats how i punch in my dreams and probably real life as well
MMA,not_removed,this really isnt thaaat bad watch some amateur womens mma some wear yoga leggings flail harder than this guy and turn their backs and crumble upon first impact this guy kept going and never gave up honestly all you can ask for when completely outclassed and underskilled
MMA,not_removed,it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat â theodore roosevelt
MMA,not_removed,im going to swing my arms like this and if i hit you its not my fault
MMA,not_removed,jesus vs punk is the fight that needs to be made
MMA,not_removed,looked like an episode of bully beatdown
MMA,not_removed,gomez vs avila please
MMA,not_removed,sounds like a bad lamb of god cover band
MMA,not_removed,he made flaily mcflailerson there look like mayweather
MMA,not_removed,jesus gonzales ate a ton of shots hes incredibly tough lol
MMA,not_removed,i see your jesus gomez and raise you one jose canseco
MMA,not_removed,jeremy bullock checking in
MMA,not_removed,holy shit his defense was equally as bad as his striking he was sticking his chin straight up in the air after being punched
MMA,not_removed,closed eyes looking up and slap punching wildly holy shitballs
MMA,not_removed,stopped watching after the first seconds
MMA,not_removed,what sort of weight is this guy i think i like him as cm punks next opponent
MMA,not_removed,greg the ranger stott
MMA,not_removed,did they pick this guy up from a bar when there was a ufc event on this is how i imagine one of those guys shit talking fighters would fare in any sort of combat
MMA,not_removed,on par with francisco trinaldo edit meant francisco trevino lol i like the argonian my bad
MMA,not_removed,he might need a straw for the beer though
MMA,not_removed,his next bout helen keller vs jesus gomez helen keller is a heavy favorite to win by ko
MMA,not_removed,or the infamous soccer mom mma fight
MMA,not_removed,well im going to kick my legs out like this and if i hit you its not my fault
MMA,not_removed,maybe if hed had a bat it would have been more even
MMA,not_removed,huge weight diff there
MMA,not_removed,if there was a match between bullock and jesus gomez id put every penny i had on gomez
MMA,not_removed,helen keller was pounds when she fought jesus
MMA,not_removed,soccer mom mma fight
MMA,not_removed,rnocontext
MMA,not_removed,thanks for linking it i was too lazy to go digging but i appreciate another chance to watch it such a travesty of a fight
MMA,not_removed,the goat and the greatest womens mma striker of all time
MMA,not_removed,should be imo hes platinum the goat
MMA,not_removed,platinum and esparza
MMA,not_removed,i dont understand why carla esparza is a staple on the joke lists
MMA,not_removed,why is carla a joke
MMA,not_removed,i wish we had olympic gold medalist henry cejudo
MMA,not_removed,mike perry and the first womens ufc straw weight champion carla esparza
MMA,not_removed,gods gift
MMA,not_removed,poofter perry is
MMA,not_removed,backflips
MMA,not_removed,whats the story behind that guy
MMA,not_removed,doesnt gods gift transcend beyond the mere title of goat
MMA,not_removed,no one does just like why does shields have a water bottle when the joke was he was throwing starbucks and tried to get a macbook
MMA,not_removed,probably cuz she was crowned champ after tuf beating fan favorite rose and being proclaimed the best strawweight in the world only to be utterly destroyed by joanna in humiliating fashion whether it was a conscious decision or not a lot of people probably lost respect for her also shes besties with felice another fighter a lot of people like to hate
MMA,not_removed,ha right like i guess i get it angela magana wouldve been better though
MMA,not_removed,check out the mma hour interview mike perry the dude is kind of a nut case and he casually defended his cornermens racist comment towards his opponent tldr hes kinda a douche
MMA,not_removed,how about gggoat as in gods greatest gift
MMA,not_removed,why would people lose respect for her because she lost that makes no sense
MMA,not_removed,people generally like winners and her loss to joanna was really really bad just a theory but i have observed it amongst people i know who supported her throughout invicta and tuf now dont care two shits about her
MMA,not_removed,it really showed her lack of skills and it was kind of funny she was ever a champ
MMA,not_removed,i love chris lytle always rooted for the dude whenever he was up
MMA,not_removed,holy shit gets rocked and instantly claps this is gold thanks for the share
MMA,not_removed,when you both accidentally hit the taunt button at the same time in ufc
MMA,not_removed,this might be the greatest thing ive ever seen a clean punch to the face made robbie hulk up lmao
MMA,not_removed,robbie is a fucking savage this is the face of a man who truly enjoys what hes doing
MMA,not_removed,robbie lawler is the most obviously masochistic person ive ever seen he legitimately enjoys being hurt
MMA,not_removed,ruthless
MMA,not_removed,is there any more appropriate nick name in combat sports history than ruthless robbie lawler dude is a complete savage scarier than most heavyweights
MMA,not_removed,everyone should check out this fight its a real war despite the slow round which seemed like both of them chose to rest round and are amazingly gifworthy young lawler with a durable lytle from ufc
MMA,not_removed,i like this new influx of nick diaz and robbie lawler gifs
MMA,not_removed,it might just be the lack of hair but robbies head sure looks bigger now
MMA,not_removed,every time i see lytle i think of his fight with beaver beaver beaver if anyone knows anything about that fight please let me know
MMA,not_removed,iirc robbie held off from gnping lytle because he was confused by the clapping after he dropped him goldberg had a gem during this fight chris lytle was quoted as saying he would like a boxing match wtf
MMA,not_removed,what an absolute beast
MMA,not_removed,lytle could bang
MMA,not_removed,this is why i mentioned this fight in the fight pass thread fuckin nuts
MMA,not_removed,back to back days where ive seen bald guys when they had hair first rory tooling on bj penn and now a young lawler lol
MMA,not_removed,how is rogan not bro enough to see lawler was celebrating taking a knockout shot and lytle is semi sarcastically applauding the same thing
MMA,not_removed,alpha male shit
MMA,not_removed,did robbie jump in his guard or what
MMA,not_removed,i want lawler holding the belt again
MMA,not_removed,chris lytle is a beast i always enjoyed his fights they where either wars or bbj shows great all rounder
MMA,not_removed,chris lytle was one of my favorite fighters
MMA,not_removed,looved chris lytle
MMA,not_removed,two sickos
MMA,not_removed,i miss robbie
MMA,not_removed,stuff like this is what makes me love the sport robbie is such a savage and i love that lytle retired off a win and a stretch to close his career out
MMA,not_removed,robbie just bleed lawler
MMA,not_removed,thats the most peculiar response and it happened times in the video the hulk up the clap and the clap after massive knock down what the fuck this is pro mma right there ive lost my real sportsmanship virginity
MMA,not_removed,miss lytle didnt he get fight of the night like nearly every fight he was in
MMA,not_removed,chris lytles fight with koscheck is probably the bloodiest fight i have ever seen
MMA,not_removed,in all his fights he was never knocked out or submitted only times he was technically stopped were from a doctors stoppage and a cut pretty impressive
MMA,not_removed,savages absolute savages
MMA,not_removed,this is amazing he just fucking loves every second of it
MMA,not_removed,gdamm i love lawler cant wait for his next fight
MMA,not_removed,both are crazy lol robbie smiles and stuff when he gets hit chris here was clapping when he got dropped
MMA,not_removed,yeah lawler is a bit nutty like that
MMA,not_removed,america clapping everywhere
MMA,not_removed,those two are tru mma legends fr tho
MMA,not_removed,mirror
MMA,not_removed,lawler on one
MMA,not_removed,this just proves that americans will clap to everything movie ends clap your food arrives clap punch someone clap almost get knocked out clap
MMA,not_removed,he was lucky the ref did not stop the fight thinking he tapped out on the knockdown
MMA,not_removed,same here was such a class act too
MMA,not_removed,i seriously miss that guy in the cage first dude i saw slap subs on the same guy at the same time
MMA,not_removed,both of them good god
MMA,not_removed,accidentally online its just a taunt fest lol
MMA,not_removed,i just hope he comes back with more hulk in him his last fights didnt add any brain cells
MMA,not_removed,i still have hair yeeeeaaaaaahhhhhh
MMA,not_removed,this is exactly the vibe i get from robbie like he was the spirit for fighting for man anyone else jeez i dont know why but he kind of scared me here
MMA,not_removed,if any gif needed the super saiyan treatment its this one
MMA,not_removed,matched only by rory mcdonald
MMA,not_removed,whats funny is no one called robbie that dana just picked it dana white called me one day and told me i needed a nickname and suggested ruthless so i said yeah whatever pick what you want so it wasnt a big deal to me it was more of a ufc marketing thing it could have been anything good choice by dana it is very fitting
MMA,not_removed,i also wouldve accepted robbie bloodmask lawler
MMA,not_removed,also be sure to check out the tannerbaroni fight from the same show despite the slightly controversial finish the ref misinterprets one of the fighters its a wild one round fight
MMA,not_removed,pharma grade hgh teste injects years of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwolffslaw in action
MMA,not_removed,it was a dam good fight
MMA,not_removed,tree piece beeva
MMA,not_removed,what is so especially weird about wanting a boxing match
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,no he said the clapping confused him probably made it feel like hed be falling for a trap this bout is on fight pass and worth a watch
MMA,not_removed,me too if it never happens again i think people will remember the amazing wars he had in his reign
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,yeah this one guy the only guy ive ever seen clap after getting knocked down definitely proves americans clap to everything without a doubt
MMA,not_removed,dodged a bullet lol
MMA,not_removed,i was really happy he went out with a w too won out of his last fights think he picked a good time to hang them up
MMA,not_removed,its like a gazelle appreciating the beautiful form of the lion that took him down as hes getting eaten alive he whispers to the lion that was smooth af bro
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtvqvipbavpk
MMA,not_removed,match made in heaven
MMA,not_removed,perfect choice by dana robbie definitely seems like the type to not give a flying shit about nicknames
MMA,not_removed,thats awesome not surprising that the guy not giving a shit about his entrance music and the guy not giving a shit about his nickname put up one of the best fights of all time not giving a shit about your health goes a long way
MMA,not_removed,reckless robbie lawler might be more accurate but ruthless obviously sounds way more badass
MMA,not_removed,thats because phil baroni can last only one round
MMA,not_removed,it took a lot out of both fighters though im sure they wood not do it again
MMA,not_removed,so good it was banned from fightpass
MMA,not_removed,it was him describing how he wanted the fight with robbie to go which sounds pretty crazy yeah you know id like to stand and trade with lawler sounds like a nice evening
MMA,not_removed,it was a vapid comment during a fight that was really typical of early goldberg ufc commentary did he really say i would like a boxing match was there no nuance to it is he a fucking robot
MMA,not_removed,wow
MMA,not_removed,that is one of the corniest thing ive ever seen faber is kind of a cheeky guy they must have known how lameawesome this group photo was side note it seems like short guys have an easier time getting an aesthetically nice body
MMA,not_removed,why did they smear grease on their faces
MMA,not_removed,looks like the cover of a gay porno and starring urijah the greased up stud muffin faber
MMA,not_removed,cant blame him lytle was a scary guy on the ground
MMA,not_removed,imagine if nate had done this in that second fight with conor wasted opportunity
MMA,not_removed,my dudee gracias d
MMA,not_removed,certain at this point
MMA,not_removed,i thought people would get the joke without the sarcasm tag
MMA,not_removed,yeah that was surely the best time to leave man i got memories from his tuf finale loss to serra such bs judging for serra i thought lytle did enough to win that fight was really looking forward to him facing gsp
MMA,not_removed,and such a lytle way to get that w too tell people beforehand that you are getting out because of your kids fight a fucking crazy fight and then to pull off a sub with secs left good memories mma doesnt have many happy endings
MMA,not_removed,his last fight was a thing of beauty lytle had a much bigger advantage over hardy on the ground but didnt even try to use it he just boxed hardy up and then hardy took it to the ground and lytle finished it with a slick submission i think it was the best performance i have ever seen in a fighters final fight
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck is a gazelle
MMA,not_removed,rory and robbie are legitimately crazy as fuck even in the world of prize fighting no one seems to enjoy violence and pain as much as them robbie finds time to laugh like a madman in nearly all of his fights im happy the mma gods deemed us worthy of lawlermcdonald ii i think of the roster would have given up at some point during that fight before those crazy motherfuckers were done with eachother after round robbie still had the energy to laugh and smile after his head was nearly knocked off and his lip was torn all the way up to his nose and after round neither seemed interested in taking a rest they would rather have the scariest staredown of all time
MMA,not_removed,yeah we need that lawlermacdonald at some point im pretty sure rory said that fight was one of the best moments of his life somehow hahaa
MMA,not_removed,i always liked robbie the brawler lawler
MMA,not_removed,lol i remember back in the day baroni and other fighters actually used to post on sherdog he responded arguing in a thread where people were dumping on him for tiring out quickly in fights someone responded back that he gassed out typing that fighters didnt post much on sherdog after that
MMA,not_removed,yeah i mean that does sound pretty nuts but the way he said it was as if it was another goldyism
MMA,not_removed,i think youre making a bigger deal out of it than it is eddie essentially said he wanted to make the conor fight into a wrestling match these things arent uncommon its a pretty simple idea really
MMA,not_removed,with or without the sarcasm tag it just isnt funny sarcasm that isnt a common stereotype so your sarcasm doesnt make sense
MMA,not_removed,to be fair that was probably the worst fight in both of their respective careers they both fought not to lose iirc and there was very little action its been years since ive seen it but i remember thinking you could make an argument for either fighter
MMA,not_removed,yeah that last point is really sad when i think about it the longer youre an mma fan the more you get to see youre favourite fighters deteriorate and become irrelevant while nubloods make fun of them because they only saw their decline i regret being that guy when i was a nublood with guys like frank shamrock when id only seen them from strikeforceelitexc and not his prime
MMA,not_removed,id like to take a moment to acknowledge hardy knowing he was losing knowing he wasnt gonna catch lytle but still pushing and willing to throw hands and make it a fight there arent a ton of fighters with that mentality but you definitely know who they are very admirable trait
MMA,not_removed,agreed very satisfying way for him to go out no slight on hardy love the dude but its always hard to see a fighter you like go out on a slide
MMA,not_removed,fancy deer nate its a fancy deer
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,fuck yours is even better
MMA,not_removed,hahaha
MMA,not_removed,yeah uberclonts comment didnt read clearly at all
MMA,not_removed,it was in regards to lytle wanting to be a pro boxer
MMA,not_removed,americans clapping for everything is kind of a common stereotype among europeans in this corner of the internet
MMA,not_removed,i cant stand to watch where hendo is in a decade its not looking good
MMA,not_removed,yeah hardys a good guy too i was just super happy for chris lytle to go out like that im sure every fighter would dream of having a performance like that in their last fight
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah shit forgot about the first one quite a good fight too
MMA,not_removed,robbie fuck yours lawler hmm has a nice ring to it
MMA,not_removed,oh i see still though that seems even less of a big deal to me should he have specified pro or something
MMA,not_removed,i was probably more hardcore during silvas come up and reign than i am now and i can tell you to us he was just like some sort of ninja god come to life it didnt even feel real like you become an mma fan and realize movie shit doesnt work then you got silva koing people with ong bak upward elbows and taking out top guys like it was boring for him and you didnt know what to believe hed ko guys you knew were tough with shots that looked like nothing mcgregor has done some of the similar things except silva didnt lose forever and he just sort of turned into this mythical force for a lot of people silva he had his share of haters too but it was way harder on them some of them were waiting like years for that first weidman fight moment thats a lot of years of rooting against a guy and being proven wrong
MMA,not_removed,noke
MMA,not_removed,we used to rip on goldie pretty bad back in the day maybe i am being supercritical
MMA,not_removed,the first sonnen fight was one of the craziest things he ever did it was kind of like julio cesar chavez vs meldrick taylor i had resigned myself to the fact that andersons streak was over then he pulled it off at the last second but at first there was confusion i wasnt sure if it was legit or not then i was flooded with relief disbelief
MMA,not_removed,lol he definitely still says some pretty dumb shit but i guess i just dont think this is necessarily one of them
MMA,not_removed,yeah me too im happy i was in a bar for that one because that was such a rollercoaster there two really drunk sonnen fans who were pregloating in end of the and as sweet silva coming back watching those two shuffle out immediately after and start kicking mailboxes outside was even sweater
MMA,not_removed,im confused is she saying she wont be part of a union because shes too loyal because thats fucking stupid
MMA,not_removed,she has no reason to be loyal to the ufc she doesnt even have a single win with the company
MMA,not_removed,loyal one more loss and the ufc will cut her like it was nothing to do them but sure show your loyalty not surprised by this considering all the other dumb shit magana does and says
MMA,not_removed,thats the problem low end fighters want to look good for the company so they are going to be the hardest ones to convince to join the ufc doesnt want a union they would have to actually give fighters benefits established fighters that see what the lower tiered fighters are going through are the ones that realize this is a necessary step
MMA,not_removed,isnt this the same girl who let someone break her back with a twister because she refused to tap
MMA,not_removed,she needs to loyal to fighters what a fucking joke
MMA,not_removed,im not surprised crabs never realize that all theyre doing is holding each other down
MMA,not_removed,she should just stick to this
MMA,not_removed,i can understand lower people being afraid to go this route but the established fighters who are not living paycheck to paycheck really need to step up and get a fighters union
MMA,not_removed,magana is in a position where she cant afford to miss any paychecks so no shes not going to say anything against the ufc and will continue to post butt pics for a little extra blip of publicity what you need are the guys people pay to see getting in a union and threatening not to fight unless the fighters are paid more and get additional benefits
MMA,not_removed,these hoes aint loyal
MMA,not_removed,dummy
MMA,not_removed,the literal and figurative bum of mma
MMA,not_removed,shes missing lots of brain cells
MMA,not_removed,my are you fucking kidding me this week is angel magan saying she is hashtagloyal
MMA,not_removed,you aint smhaat but you loyal
MMA,not_removed,scab
MMA,not_removed,too stupid imo
MMA,not_removed,real dumb reasoning and she shoulda kept her mouth shut in case she changes her mind dumb moves
MMA,not_removed,lolmma fighters are too stupid to have a union queue matt serra gif
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,well zuffa did their very best to get that video of her pissing herself in her fight with michelle waterson taken down so yeah she loyal
MMA,not_removed,no every fighter seems to want to be a part of a union see for example and
MMA,not_removed,some people are afraid that supporting a union will hurt their career if it doesnt happen so they either sit on the fences or oppose it to appear as company guys
MMA,not_removed,thats called being more loyal to the management than to your fellow fighters if we do get a union lets keep magana out of it
MMA,not_removed,you think she would have gotten paid more in invicta one fc or bellator
MMA,not_removed,wasnt that a joke and she was actually in a car accident
MMA,not_removed,yeah but that ass though
MMA,not_removed,in practice no less lol
MMA,not_removed,no its a girl who posted a picture claiming that and for some reason everyone believed her iirc it was a car accident
MMA,not_removed,crabs angela magana what you did there
MMA,not_removed,yeah wait what are we talking about again right unions i feel they are round and supple
MMA,not_removed,dear diary that ass was fat
MMA,not_removed,holy mole Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°
MMA,not_removed,cue shouldnt throw stones
MMA,not_removed,oh thats what happened i remember trying to show my friend that video recently and wasnt able to find it anywhere
MMA,not_removed,wow i missed that hard i havent even heard of this until now
MMA,not_removed,anyone got a vid never heard of this until now edit found it
MMA,not_removed,i can understand not wanting to be part of a union but based off what ive learned of the ufc so far they are only going to reward your loyalty if its profitable to them phrased this way it kind of makes magana sound like an ass kisser and the company may well shaft her at a later juncture regardless
MMA,not_removed,fighting in the ufc is our union sad as it sounds thats probably the better than a lot of people could ever hope for
MMA,not_removed,lauzon has been one of the highest earning fighters of the past decade not too surprising really
MMA,not_removed,of course lauzon and brown arent they put on exciting fights so theyre getting a fuckton in bonusses both disclosed and undisclosed joining a union is a sure way of pissing the ufc off and saying bye bye to your additional income same reason as to why lauzon is always positive about reebok
MMA,not_removed,why would they not want to be part of a union what bad will come out of that
MMA,not_removed,their is also a lot of people that understand unions are complicated and can just be as corruption as the company their workers work for it not a easy situation this idea that reddit has that unions are a workers wet dream and fix all the issues is weird to me if someone actually breaks down good union laws where the lawyers and the head union people are not hoarding the money then sure if the union lets workers leave then sure if they do not do their job then sure if the union actually protects all fighters and just not the big names then sure it is a lot more complicated then people think
MMA,not_removed,dont you mean loyal to the money
MMA,not_removed,im not in the position to speculate but she isnt making much with the ufc im pretty sure she hasnt made more than in show reebok money and thats not taking other factors into account taxes coaches not sure what fighters are drawing for sponsorship money in second tier organizations at this point and considering she hasnt won a fight in a really long time i doubt she would get much either way i think her focus should be finding a career outside of mma
MMA,not_removed,yes funny how no one seems to realize that
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,you can find vines of it but once youve seen it live nothing else comes close
MMA,not_removed,i was literally trying to watch it today and couldnt find it
MMA,not_removed,definitely understand the reluctance to unionize people dont understand unions are usually coercive in that membership is forced associations allow labor to choose individually whether to payin for collective services and be represented by people other than themselves im not a lawyer but i thought it was actually impossible under labor laws for ufc contractors read unorganized labor to unionize
MMA,not_removed,woahwaityou are telling me that a company rewards an employee for making money for that companyscandalous i tell you
MMA,not_removed,lauzon would have to be an idiot to want a union xd he gets a fair earning with the work he puts in why destroy that and receive a more average earning
MMA,not_removed,the ones that actually manage to be the top in the ufc most of the times
MMA,not_removed,dayummmmm make her a ring girl
MMA,not_removed,mind a link
MMA,not_removed,im generally pro union myself though my understanding of them is rudimentary because theyve done a lot for the working class and i believe in them as a counterbalance to corporate interests they are by no means perfect i get why fighters would be reluctant to sign onto an organization that they would have to pay dues to while being possibly stuck backing decisions voted upon by the majority that they themselves didnt agree with personally i think that unionizing might behoove fighters maganas reasoning just sounds terrible so far
MMA,not_removed,people dont understand unions are usually coercive in that membership is forced associations allow labor to choose individually whether to payin for collective services and be represented by people other than themselves the reason for that is because unions negotiate terms that benefit everyone even if they arent paying in so people that dont opt to join the union become free riders
MMA,not_removed,unions are unions all can be bad or good name one of my questions that is not valid in a sports union plus unions have had bad influences and good influences in every field the word union is not a perfect solution the union itself has to be run by good people with good rules and regulations
MMA,not_removed,not with that face
MMA,not_removed,the reason for that is because unions negotiate terms that benefit everyone even if they arent paying in no the reason for that is that unions are often forced to represent everyone even if they arent paying in theres nothing coercive about union shops youre free to work elsewhere
MMA,not_removed,all of the major sports have unions mlbpa nhlpa nflpa nbapa all of them fight for minimum pay health insurance and practice regulations the problem is that they have collective bargaining agreements and i dont believe the ufc is just going to accept a union from its contractors
MMA,not_removed,bangs perfect tens on the daily thats why angela is below his standards she is sad now
MMA,not_removed,yea and look how bad the nfl union is and look how it actually hurts some players i heard the nba is truly good and the others i have no clue about just because it is a sports does not make ot automatically good and like you said this is different again if they do it the right way then yea but that does not mean as a fighter do not go blindly into like a sheep cause it is a sports union
MMA,not_removed,mmma
MMA,not_removed,if the nfl didnt have a players union they wouldnt be able to argue for heath insurance per contract year minimum pay increases and other support systems available to players such as financial assistance with money management
MMA,not_removed,that baby being held up in the cheering crowd gets me every time
MMA,not_removed,mark hunt is a scary man frank mir probably took a second there to remember his own name
MMA,not_removed,for a second i thought this was one of those this day last year posts and i got very freaked out i had lost that time
MMA,not_removed,jun at utc mar mark hunt def frank mir via walk off ko punch of httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,i am in this video my head is right above the clock at the very start
MMA,not_removed,fucking going loin king on the baby
MMA,not_removed,he went jr smith
MMA,not_removed,null
MMA,not_removed,dbz for life
MMA,not_removed,anything with minowaman im ok with may check it out
MMA,not_removed,or hes going to stand there flat footed and counter strike like usual no disrespect to rory hes just not an aggro fighter
MMA,not_removed,ufc the return of jake shields stpierre vs shields ii the rematch you didnt know you wanted because you dont actually want it at all
MMA,not_removed,i predict neither diaz brother will be on the card and itll probably be a normal card and everyone will be disappointed
MMA,not_removed,id love the diaz brothers to fight apparently weidman is trying to push a fight through and hes my favourite fighter so thatll be awesome although he got kod recently i dunno maybe could be bispings next defence im hearing rumours of though
MMA,not_removed,i know nates said he wants to wait for mcgreggor rematch but i think he raises his stock and might force that rematch to take place more on his terms with a win over a top guy
MMA,not_removed,a gsp return rumour a nick diaz return rumour and then hopefully a real fight with joe lauzon
MMA,not_removed,i predict that neither diaz brother is on the card
MMA,not_removed,nick vs silva ii and then he calls out mcgregor after he wins if mcgregor beats nate at ufc whenever then you got the irishman against big brother set up for the interim middleweight belt in the future
MMA,not_removed,calling it now nick and nate wont compete at khabib vs ferguson for interim title
MMA,not_removed,you guys are setting yourselves up for disappointment its likely that the ufc has planned and outlined fights far past and has a general idea of the potential fights that will be on it if youre expecting nick or nate to be on the card simply because its then ive got some bad news for you
MMA,not_removed,i expect weidman will be on it thats enough for me any other fight is gravy
MMA,not_removed,nick and nate would never fight just stop i hope bisping loses the title by then so we could get nick vs bisping
MMA,not_removed,remindme febuary
MMA,not_removed,not sure about silva but i love the rest of the idea
MMA,not_removed,i think he just means nick and nate fighting on the same card at least i hope thats what he means
MMA,not_removed,good article weed is such a stupid thing to test for as part of athletics
MMA,not_removed,for a second i thought it said draymond green
MMA,not_removed,went to school with this guy such a dick to the fullest extent a bully in every sense of the word would talk shit and make fun of people for any reason he could come up with down to what they were wearing or if they walked funny would constantly skip class and back talk the teacher when he showed up without any assignments done real scum of the earth hope he gets knocked out
MMA,not_removed,draymond the dick kicking goat
MMA,not_removed,in all seriousness id love to see someone with a basketball players athleticism choose mma just to see what would happen could you imagine if lebron at got into kickboxing instead of basketball
MMA,not_removed,damn thats crazy i was a freshman when he was in the paper all the time i transferred out of ub after my first year but when i heard about him in mma i remembered the name and rooted for him this makes me think otherwise
MMA,not_removed,if it makes you feel better hes got some ugly fuckin hands
MMA,not_removed,no ones talking about high school this was junior year of college where youd think his brain would be a little more developed and past something as petty talking shit about strangers and being a dickhead for no reason
MMA,not_removed,if he beats tj it happens ufc would love the idea of this it would be probably the only opportunity they currently have to bring excitement and attention to
MMA,not_removed,thats an interesting fight i imagine dj doesnt have many challengers after reis anyway
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if garbrandt can make flw though he seems like a good sized bw
MMA,not_removed,kinda wanna see how mm handles codys boxing having in mind that mm would have some trouble get cody down
MMA,not_removed,if the fight is happening at then i favor mm by submission cody at wont be the same as cody at thats a big cut since hes already a small guy and those pounds will have a noticeable effect on his cardio power endurance and everything weve seen it happen all the time recently with diego sanchezs only bout at fw he looked like shit pettis too couldnt even make weight the second time and even on his first fight against oliveira at fw he was already starting to gas on round and cody is smaller than them so the same pounds are harder on him since its a bigger percentage of total body weight he gets outlasted then overwhelmed by mm after round at though id favor cody
MMA,not_removed,if dj beats cody then by mma math he can beat cruz
MMA,not_removed,oh my god that would be amazing
MMA,not_removed,now this is a good fight between those two assuming cody beats tj
MMA,not_removed,what happened to aldo and conor being next on his hit list he must have come to his senses finally im sceptical he can make healthily and even if he does i doubt hell be the same extra pounds for a guy that size is no joke
MMA,not_removed,im not a big fan of everyone wanting to be double champs now fighters should just stick in their own class and defend or vacate then challenge
MMA,not_removed,how much difficulty will he have making that weight
MMA,not_removed,cody is an animal i underestimated him but he cruzd cruz and dominated the dominator
MMA,not_removed,now everyone wants an undeserved shot at a second belt good job ufc
MMA,not_removed,really want to see this at fw over bw we all know mm is small i want to see him closer to his weight
MMA,not_removed,conor i love you more than words but godamn it everytime somebody wins fight now they im gonna be the first division champion
MMA,not_removed,now thats a superfight i really want to see
MMA,not_removed,its funny how tj got completely shat on by this place for talking about moving up to fight aldo after cruz after hed already defended his belt twice but cody is getting nothing but love for talking about moving down to fight smaller guy when he hasnt even defended his belt yet
MMA,not_removed,i would pay to watch that
MMA,not_removed,mm is way too small for cody why doesnt cody go up and fight people his own size at its not really an accomplishment if youre with a significant reach and boxing advantage going against a flyweight
MMA,not_removed,how about you defend your title
MMA,not_removed,id watch either of them fight mm
MMA,not_removed,for all i know mighty mouse should be the one moving up given how hes talked about doing it if the money was right i dont think cody is at the stage where he could make such demands and theyre granted to him its just wrong
MMA,not_removed,this could be the fight to make cody a superstar
MMA,not_removed,im actually all for this one so dj gets the attention and hype he deserves
MMA,not_removed,its not often you hear champs talking about going down in weight to get another belt seems weird like im bigger than that champion so im going to cut some more weight and go take his belt that said mm is the goat of the smaller guys so its still going to be a hell of a challenge just feels odd to me
MMA,not_removed,rip garbrandt
MMA,not_removed,assuming they both win i could definitely see this happening i feel like cody could be the next star of the ufc not superstar if hes marketed right i think he could be similar to pettis where he gets a big push but i dont think theyll do it early like they did with pettis
MMA,not_removed,thats surprising pounds when you only weigh is a big deal i never thought garbrandt would even try that hes gonna look nasty up on that scale the day before
MMA,not_removed,for anyone who didnt read the article he says he wants mm after tj if cruz doesnt want a rematch and im pretty sure dom has said he wants the next shot after the two of them go at it i honestly dont expect anyone challenging for the belt before dom if hes healthy
MMA,not_removed,i swear every day i hear a new fighter wanting to be a double champ dana opened a can of worms
MMA,not_removed,if he beats tj book it
MMA,not_removed,after watching dj struggle on his feet against the tuf winner im pretty sure cody would sleep him
MMA,not_removed,i hope cody wrecks mm dude needs to be dethroned already
MMA,not_removed,anyone else find the most interesting part of this interview where cody says he doesnt believe cruz is coming back i wonder why hed think that
MMA,not_removed,its interesting that no one shits on cody for calling out champions below and above him without defending his title while everyone was shitting on woodley when he was calling out people at his own weight class racisms not real people move along
MMA,not_removed,everyone is so fucking obsessed with being a multidivision champ the second they get the belt these days nobody wants to stay put and build a division
MMA,not_removed,well he knocked cruz out and cruz is the only one to beat dj makes sense to me
MMA,not_removed,idk why ufc dont just get their flyweights to fight at bw theres so few of them as is and theyd be more likely to finish there
MMA,not_removed,all de belts
MMA,not_removed,damn it ever since conor won a second belt its all any champ ever talks about or even up and comers like kelvin saying his going to win two belts how about actually defending the belt a couple times in the same division
MMA,not_removed,i actually like this idea everyone wants a money fight with mcgregor but this is actually a non mcgregor fight with great interest
MMA,not_removed,cody no dad koing mm is the best thing that can happen to fw at this point
MMA,not_removed,i doubt cody can do the weight cut
MMA,not_removed,it would be probably the only opportunity they currently have to bring excitement and attention to yeah or they could have tried to actually promote the division
MMA,not_removed,how many times do we have to hear a newly minted usually champion talk about cross divisional bouts before we realize they are rare for a reason personally im done waiting f on gsp v silva remember when weidman called out jones at a press conference or what about cruz moving up for a champion vs champion blur against aldo or mcgregor at lw dj is planning on coming up to bw any day now jones to hw silva vs jones or any lhw champ during his year reign people jump weight classes but major fights against ranked contenders or champions usually only happen after serious losing streaks or eliminations from title contention due to a dominant champion beating them multiple times edgar dodson cerrone rda pettis bendo all waited until after their titles or number one contender status were gone to move for a reason it poses much more risk than reward and as many have suggested here its likely the ufc feels it is in their best interest to avoid matchups like this for one reason or another aldo said hes asked for the lw shot multiple times iirc mcgregor and penn are outliers
MMA,not_removed,cody is not a flw he should put his belt on the line
MMA,not_removed,they better make it happen asap because garbrandt is still young hes going to naturally get bigger
MMA,not_removed,is exciting the fights are great there just isnt enough bullshit showy aspects for fair weather fans
MMA,not_removed,sure everyone gets excited for one fight but what if he wins he prolly wouldnt even give mm a rematch before moving back up let alone defend the belt beyond that giving garbrandt that fight is like giving a rub to a part timer the division needs a real flyweight to take the belt off mm
MMA,not_removed,or he could get a few more wins t and then go up and fight holloway or aldo
MMA,not_removed,yeah but if anyone deserves a chance at a second belt here its dj at bw not the other way around granted thats a much tougher fight for dj and hell want to break the record first but still
MMA,not_removed,we got benavidez vs nguyen and cejudo vs pettis coming up if either nguyen or pettis can win by finish i can see them getting a shot
MMA,not_removed,he said he walks around at so i would assume he can make the flyweight limit with a bit of effort
MMA,not_removed,he makes a good point about being able to do this much easier at a younger age once hes in his be rough
MMA,not_removed,hes said he can and that the weight cut to is easy i would like him to take a decent time between fights tho so the dropping and gaining the weight doesnt hurt him at bantamweight
MMA,not_removed,crazy that cody is imo the worst match up for both mm and cruz
MMA,not_removed,if cody walks around at then cutting shouldnt be a big problem he wouldnt be talking about it if he didnt think he could make the cut his cardio has shown he can go rounds and still look strong although itll be interesting to see how he fairs against the dynamo that is dj honestly it could just be cody wrestelfucking dj for rounds a la cruz
MMA,not_removed,think theyd do catchweight
MMA,not_removed,cruz also beats cody by mma math cody beats dj by mma math triple threat belt on a pole match at ufc
MMA,not_removed,yea im really excited for that fight i have this feeling cody is going to get tkod though
MMA,not_removed,going low is a grade a bitch move
MMA,not_removed,djs the only one who i think has earned the right to go for two division belts hes never ducked a fight and hes completely and entirely wiped out his division
MMA,not_removed,he said he walks around at in pretty sure thats around where mighty mouse cuts from who knows if he is telling the truth on his walk around but if he is then he can make it with not too much difficulty i think
MMA,not_removed,this is the only way its competitive i believe
MMA,not_removed,yeah as much as i want to see dj get paid it feels weird to me seeing a guy call out someone way smaller than him dj is fast as fuck but that size difference is going to make his clinch and wrestling game a lot harder if it doesnt almost completely nullify it
MMA,not_removed,the conor effect
MMA,not_removed,no he didnt
MMA,not_removed,yeah that would be a rough cut id imagine i bet dj would be willing to go to for it
MMA,not_removed,he seems adamant he can do it on twitter he said he walks around at lbs who knows hes not a big guy as is
MMA,not_removed,idk he seemed to be able to cut to bantamweight really easily eating smores in embedded granted lbs is a lot but i think it should be doable i have facts to back up my statement
MMA,not_removed,yea if he won hed have to go back to and then to thats got to be stressful on the bodyl
MMA,not_removed,jack slack made a pretty good point about this in one of his podcasts recently they pretty much hide the up and comers on the prelims with zero exposure or promotion then theyre suddenly fighting on a main card for the title so no one knows or cares who they are then when they lose its directly back to the prelims theres literally no promotion for the division what so ever which is truly shitty because dj is easily one of the most likeable champs on the roster
MMA,not_removed,tbf recently they dont try to promote any of the divisions
MMA,not_removed,yeah or they could have tried to actually promote the division someone give this man some fuckin gold
MMA,not_removed,blame the fighters for not being interesting promoting their own fights or even finishing their fights if someone went out there and started knocking cunts cold left right and centre people would start to care about it and the ufc would give them main card bouts
MMA,not_removed,that was with the old matchmaker bruh
MMA,not_removed,hell probably want to set the defence record first though and what better way to do that than in a big crossdivisional fight against a burgeoning star who can back it up assuming hes beaten tj of course
MMA,not_removed,totally his fight against cruz at was a solid fight if cruz had won against cody i would have loved to see that again
MMA,not_removed,yep but this is the problem with flyweight its really too early in their development and dj will crush either of them
MMA,not_removed,dom walks around at and garbrandt stuffed every td attempt dat boi strong
MMA,not_removed,he should be able to then that seems to be around what some of flyweights are mm is from like but hes far from the biggest fw
MMA,not_removed,losing when you weight is an order of magnitude harder than losing when you weight
MMA,not_removed,shit the more we talk about it the crazier it sounds
MMA,not_removed,i agree i dont see any scenario where this ends well for mm cody has very few holes in his game and is far bigger and stronger
MMA,not_removed,cutting pounds isnt really crazy for someone like luke rockhold cutting pounds when you only weigh is pretty significant
MMA,not_removed,cody wants the belt its not a title fight if its a catchweight
MMA,not_removed,then it wouldnt be for the flyweight belt like he wants
MMA,not_removed,youve give me much to ponder ð¤
MMA,not_removed,yeah but the way he was talking before the three divisions would have been bw fw and lw i think any top lw will murder him and i dont see any way he beats aldo if he can make flw healthily it makes much more sense to go for that belt instead
MMA,not_removed,i could see him angling for aldo lolmcg has a better chance of beating woodley than garbrandt has of beating aldo the kid is amazingly talented but there are limits
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats a really good point maybe dj should challenge cody for his title or we could go full wwe and have both titles on the line at one weight
MMA,not_removed,on the jre dj said he cuts from around i believe cody looks a lot bigger so i dont know how he walks around at
MMA,not_removed,man at his height and bulk i dont see how he walks around at maybe that is him super lean and before a water cut but him at would be a bit much i think at this weight is a lot but hey maybe he is right
MMA,not_removed,if he can make the weight he has every right to fight at the weight division there are taller fighters in every division nate tony conor at fw doesnt make it any less impressive to win the weight restriction is there for both
MMA,not_removed,i hold my l he dominated him in a decision
MMA,not_removed,im not so sure cody would have a wrestling advantage and at that size it could become a problem for dj with cody already saying he wants to cut the weight dj would be smart to keep the fight at that being said to be my own devils advocate at dj doesnt have his belt on the line which is a pro but i think in terms of codys end game he wants that flyw title and his bw title in order to challenge for the fw as well if thats his game edit general english
MMA,not_removed,then thats not the flyweight title fight cody wants
MMA,not_removed,i dont get it though how does no one bitch about being tiny yet just about everyone hates on outside of mm there isnt a huge size difference between the two divisions
MMA,not_removed,and they didnt sign any of them letting them all go to other companies afterwards so like tind said they are not promoting the division fans are stupid and can be conditioned look at how the fans fall in love with every employee they are used to seeing in the ufc that end up being fired or let go ufc just hasnt treated fly like they should and really pump it up
MMA,not_removed,that couldnt save it after they had some of the worst fucking matchmaking ever
MMA,not_removed,it would be if there wasnt a mile separating dj and the pack youre absolutely right nobody could promote it any better
MMA,not_removed,one season of tuf isnt really a whole lot of promotion i think it isnt interesting to people who dont understand the nuances of the sport and just wasnt to see people get kod
MMA,not_removed,it isnt interesting because every nontitle fight is buried on the undercard and nobody is going to give a fuck about a bunch of guys nobody knows i follow the ufc fairly closely and i know a total of current flyweights off the top of my head
MMA,not_removed,watching dudes who look like elementary schoolers punching each other arent that fun even at high level maybe dj and garbranth gang up on stipe would be good for the money
MMA,not_removed,i am confused how is putting a non promoted division on a declining tv equal to the ufc raising flyweight i am going to just enjoy this being the truth as it gets downvoted
MMA,not_removed,a whole season of tuf where they promoted fighters from other orgs instead of promoting fightersfighters already there also fly weight has been around for years now so its kind of too little too late because they left it til mighty mouse already beat everyone
MMA,not_removed,eh mm finishes more title fights than jon or gsp did its just that folks dont appreciate smaller fighters maybe itll change one day but it wont be over night
MMA,not_removed,horiguchi has a dam good ko rate and fun stylistic mix of karate and boxing yet his match against another top dude was buried on the prelims of an already pretty shobby card
MMA,not_removed,i feel its a lot to do with the fact that these guys in the flyweight division are so small that mma fans cant relate to them people dont take them seriously unfortunately
MMA,not_removed,its not their job to be interesting its their job to win fights its the promotions job to sell it
MMA,not_removed,as oppose to the new match maker where we wait until theyre retired first
MMA,not_removed,chuck was supposed to steamroll rashad gsp was supposed to steamroll serra etc etc there are no guarantees in fighting and mm can lose on any given day to anyone on this level even though hes for good reason favored to win most fights the reality of losing is still there so you have to put these guys against him
MMA,not_removed,no way dom is walking within lbs of mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,only thing that might be of concern is codys chin after a bigger weight cut
MMA,not_removed,cody has very few holes in his game conveniently he is also champion of the weakest division that isnt flwif he was to go up to fw and challenge any top you would see those holes real quick
MMA,not_removed,i agree that at some point your genetics just wont allow your body to weigh x amount but cody most likely doesnt cut water weight leading up to a fight and just arrives in shape would he not have an easier time cutting that extra considering how we see some fighters cut between for a fight i dont think its out of the question
MMA,not_removed,cody is too way too small for lw hell have permanent brain damage if he tries that hes a fairly small featherweight considering we have people like max holloway but i still cant see him beating frankie aldo or holloway
MMA,not_removed,maybe he walks around at but i recall him saying that his in shape weight is lbs so he cuts lbs which is still considerable but reasonable for a flyweight
MMA,not_removed,i didnt say its not his right i would definitely tune in to root for dj if the fight happened my point was that larger fighters calling out smaller fighters is a little weird to me especially considering that dj isnt a huge draw tyron calling out conor makes sense because conor is a huge draw and if conor did fight tyron he would have the same height and reach just not nearly as thick as tyron i have to imagine from a marketing stand point it would be kind of strange for the average casual fan to see this dude with neck tattoos absolutely merking other bantomweights and styling on cruz moving down to fight a guy that regardless of skill is literally the smallest dude on the roster
MMA,not_removed,why do you think cody would have a wrestling advantage
MMA,not_removed,tim elliot and cody are the same size size advantage wont be to much of stretch plus at dj is master recovery and taking shots he is the best at making adjustments as well dodson was not able to stop him for his example i feel footwork and the outside range will be a major deciding factor in the fight
MMA,not_removed,cody cannot make on any day dj has been looking for super fights and he has cleaned out cody is also looking for super fights to get a pay day a fight at with the belt on the line is the only fight that would happen imo is one division they can hold up the belt init has been cleaned out and is fairly boring for fans if dj won hed have another super fight at against cruz
MMA,not_removed,because you have entertainment at everybody wants to see a ko artist garbrandt a high volume and technical finisher tj and an amazing comeback story unbeatable style superior shit talking cruz
MMA,not_removed,watching dj fight is always fun hes one of the most technically sound fighters weve ever seen and he looks spectacular in every single round he fights
MMA,not_removed,just bleed bro
MMA,not_removed,absolutely retarded
MMA,not_removed,did you want them to just put the whole ufc flyweight division on the show
MMA,not_removed,and dj doesnt like to talk if the champ is saying he doesnt care whether he wins or loses then why should the fans
MMA,not_removed,i dont argue that size has something to do with it but it isnt the be all and end all people love bw because of the personalities and finishes if the champ didnt finish fights and you had a ko artist coming through then sure that would help but as it stand theres no opponent people are interested in dj fighting because no one looks like a real threat that could take him out
MMA,not_removed,how many kos did he have in the ufc and how long ago were they they cant promote fighters with material from other organisations and in the ufc horiguchi was a decision fighter particularly at flyweight one of his only two ufc finishes was at bantamweight
MMA,not_removed,wrong its just being conditioned to not care from boxing ufc is failing at promotion the division and thats all it is the flyweight fights are just as good as the other weight classes
MMA,not_removed,well thats just not true theyre in the entertainment industry if they werent this would be like the olympics once every four years
MMA,not_removed,its not their job to be interesting someone needs a new name
MMA,not_removed,yeah but id rather garbrant fight he poses a legit interesting question sure if any of the fight mm they all have a punchers chance or might shock us but thats all they have a massive long shot id rather mm actually challenge himself for that record
MMA,not_removed,he said he walks around on jre
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor walks around his coach and training partners have said before i dont understand why some people think he walks at just because he weighed in at that weight against diaz he was in fight shape and is obviously going to be leaner and lighter than he would be out of competition
MMA,not_removed,that first x poundswhatever the number is that he cuts is a lot easier to cut than that second pounds
MMA,not_removed,or pettis or who da fook is dat guy imagine cody getting tagged by a stephens bomb
MMA,not_removed,i usually agree but i cant say a man is trying to pick on smaller diggers when hes calling out mm i mean its mm one of the goats
MMA,not_removed,a couple reasons the first being the disparity in height and strength between the two of them the second being that cody wrestled in high school like dj but decided to play football instead of compete regularly in wrestling and he still placed in state and received interest from schools these things combined with the fact that i dont think dj has faced a wrestler that can set up their takedowns with punches the way cody can which we saw against dom and it could be an issue
MMA,not_removed,cody says he walks around at do you not think he can think make it with some months notice and a couple of experts
MMA,not_removed,its worth stating that by the numbers historically no on cares about bw either
MMA,not_removed,cruzs shit talking is beyond cringy he sounds like the smart kid in middle school every time hes talking to someone its almost unbearable and dj fits all of those molds you just put out as well hes a very technical fighter finisher ala tj he has a unique near unbeatable style ala cruz and while he doesnt have as many kos as garbrandt he still has five on his record
MMA,not_removed,to me an unbeatable style is the guy about to tie the most defences in ufc history also if people like high volume and technical finishes how the fuck can you not love dj hes the king of high volume he out volumes guys on epo
MMA,not_removed,his fights with dodson and benevidez are some of my favorite fights to watch i dont understand people who say the division is boring just because the guys are small ive seen way more boring heavyweight fights than flyweight fights
MMA,not_removed,noone believes you
MMA,not_removed,small guys always have better technique because of speed n stuff but thatit most people dont know wtfs going on they just know someone get punched and knocked out
MMA,not_removed,doing exactly that pretty much got kimbo slice to the ufc
MMA,not_removed,really you dislike the fact that he fights simply to fight
MMA,not_removed,when does dom finish fights hes not even that much of a personality either dj is definitely more of a personality than dom and has finished more fights
MMA,not_removed,every face needs a good heel i agree but hopefully they continue to cultivate the smaller weight classes so they get theirs
MMA,not_removed,michael johnson the closest thing in the lightweight top ten of ko artist besides mcgregor only has three spread over a lot larger number of fights khabib hasnt only got one ferguson has only kikuno in his last or so fights barboza only two in his last fights when you get into the top kos fall insanely and because flyw is what it is he was shoved into the top fast
MMA,not_removed,no this is a sport offensive lineman of football teams dont have to entertain us w their personality its just a fucking cop out to lean on charismatic fighters like that is supposed to be the norm that isnt realistic not everyone has charisma
MMA,not_removed,no it fits me perfectly its not their job their job is to fight and win but the promoter just puts it on them to do more so the promoter doesnt have to any work for him or herself with that silly unrealistic way of thinking every fighter has to act like conor to be interesting to the fair weather bottom feeders thats not realistic
MMA,not_removed,there are bigger challenges than cody cody just has power so the simple minded people think thats what makes a fight exciting
MMA,not_removed,dom at must be fat dom hahaha
MMA,not_removed,his coach said he cut a bit of weight to make as well
MMA,not_removed,fight night weight is the only important metric here whats the point of comparing walkaround weight when theyre out of camp
MMA,not_removed,by walk around were obviously talking about fight weight or what weight they are in fight week i understand theyre two different things but cody being is obviously what he cuts from which is why i believe theres no way dom is cutting from and thats why i call him fat dom does that make sense haha
MMA,not_removed,i mean no shit i dont think anyones ever said weight cutting gets easier as they cut more weight
MMA,not_removed,only if he can hit him cody footwork gud
MMA,not_removed,hey i didnt say cody is picking on smaller guys and i didnt say that mighty mouse isnt one of the best guys in the game all i said was that it looks weird especially if youre a casual watcher who barely knows who dj is in the first place
MMA,not_removed,remember that dj destroyed an olympic wrestler though he might not have the same credentials but hes one of the best mma wrestlers out there
MMA,not_removed,i dont think is a fight you make with cody ever lbs is a weight class people should not get a title shot in unless they can prove they can make the weight in a fight or two you have so many guys missing weight because it really is a ridiculous weight class for grown men to make
MMA,not_removed,if he walks around at the cut should be easy most flyweights walk around dj is actually on the smaller side for flyweights
MMA,not_removed,i cared when cruz came back and then shit really popped off when he actually beat tj its one of the more exciting divisions now is just stale mm doesnt sell fights id rather him call for superfights and move up rather than fight benevidez for the time
MMA,not_removed,actually by the numbers bw is pretty much a normal division in terms of drawing power the ppvs that faber headlined against barao did more buys than most of aldos and his rubber match with cruz did buys very decent numbers along with the tv ratings for the cruz vs tj fight a strong conclusion could be made that the bw division is more popular than not only the flyweight division and the featherweight division without conor
MMA,not_removed,cruz is probably has the smartest fight iq in the game so his trash talking suits him perfectly
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse doesnt sell fights cruz does hell even garbrandt and tj do all of them called for potential superfights against mm aldo or conor and they all go that extra mile to sell a fight and get people excited i get that you love dj we all do his skills are incredible but theres a reason his fights dont sell and thats because hes the worst champ in the ufc in terms of promotion
MMA,not_removed,i think djs fights are fun but nobody else at flw holds an excitement for me
MMA,not_removed,case in point compare tuf fights with the last season not even close in excitement
MMA,not_removed,i believes him
MMA,not_removed,dom shit talks for days if dj has more of a personality he hasnt shown it anywhere near as openly as dom has
MMA,not_removed,that would also help but not even just that there hasnt been anybody in a long time where people think wow he could actually beat dj let alone wow he could finish dj i cant see why they dont just scrap the division and have the guys fight at though theyd be more powerful so higher chance of finishes and its such a small division it wouldnt even inconvenience many fighters
MMA,not_removed,tbf theyve all had submissions where horiguchi hasnt had any khabibs popularity is also primarily because of his selfmarketing especially to the russian fanbase horiguchi hasnt really done that with japan
MMA,not_removed,do not forget most of the extremely stupid mentality is personality talking shit if people want to talk about talking shit then they should say it instead of code naming it personality because there are many ways they can show their personality without talking shit
MMA,not_removed,you didnt watch his last fight did you the take down defense foot work speed and a little glimpse of a solid wresting base i mean he was clowning on one of the best bantamweights ever
MMA,not_removed,i mean he isnt the most shredded dude ever and we know from embedded that he fucking loves tamales i could see dom walking near his first fights were actually at lightweight iirc
MMA,not_removed,does that make sense haha no because nobody else actually thinks that
MMA,not_removed,oh for sure and i was blown away by his performance against hc but not to take anything away from hc it reminded my a lot of ronda just in the way that his wrestling didnt work to his advantage because of his exposure in other areas of his game but this comes from how stellar and well rounded dj is edit wrong guy
MMA,not_removed,dj didnt outwrestle him though in fact he got taken down that fight
MMA,not_removed,i want dj to get a money fight so i am not too bothered if they make it it will be fun to watch
MMA,not_removed,i dont think we have enough contenders at for that maybe they can have a term in the bout agreement that says for every x pound cody is over the weight limit dj gets x percent of his purse
MMA,not_removed,very true was stagnant for a while then you had tj dismantle the current champ and he was a bit of a talker then comes along the og champ who talks his ass off and then comes along and lil bundle of hate who can sell a fight like a mother fucker on the other hand has been dominated by one of the poundforpound best in the world but dj doesnt sell fights he respects his opponents and doesnt trash talk if someone does talk trash he doesnt engage this makes it hard for people to get excited about his fights for god sakes dj call out someone after a fight not only that let the people know your gonna molly wop whoever you call out too tell cruz hes gonna get put into retirement tell cody that his champ dreams are cute but he hasnt learned whats its like to be outclassed do something you beautiful technical bastard
MMA,not_removed,hes chasing records first he wants that validation first and i dont really blame him for it as good as he is if i were him i would want that little bit of history validating me as well
MMA,not_removed,a benavidez trilogy would be dope i thought beefcake won the first fight by a slim margin obv dj got his in the rematch but its really just them two at flyweight down the line we have sergio pettis on the rise kid is as entertaining as his older brother and quickly getting better id prefer those two fight to dj getting tossed around by way bigger guys in cruz cody and tj
MMA,not_removed,yes faber is a draw bws are not the tv ratings for cruz vs tj were a one off thing again historically bw particularly cruz have been terrible draws even for the lighter divisions no one is going to argue that fw was just killing it but it was objectively a more popular division than bw or flw
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse doesnt sell fights speak for yourself demetrious is imo one of the best reasons for a ppv
MMA,not_removed,tuf was so long ago the show is hardly the same level of competition has gone up a lot
MMA,not_removed,had gave
MMA,not_removed,i think hes shown it much more don does nothing any different than hundreds of other fighters mighty mouse is in there doing flips and promoting his fan base interacts with his fans on social media and in his stream etc all dom does is give a smirk and give the exact same shit talk as fighters have been saying for the past years
MMA,not_removed,so personality talking shit that is the dumbest thing i have heard but seems to be the majority opnion in murrica
MMA,not_removed,i cant see why they dont just scrap the division and have the guys fight at though thats what the situation was before they created the division and it didnt work mms only two losses came at did you watch him againstâ cruz the weight difference was more than you make out
MMA,not_removed,also on finished for fw their were more finishes in a champion to be crowned than there were in edgar vs penn which was middle and lhw if you put good fights on between top fighters in places people can see them the stigma goes away and flyw is feasible again plus the tuf season proves nothing tuf was dying to begin with there was no way flyweight with its stigma was ever going to save that show flyweight is already burdened enough with bad promoting as it is also japanese dont watch ufc shin aoki still rules this roost
MMA,not_removed,thank you
MMA,not_removed,i watch every fight and cody studied and prepared for cruz for a long time that doesnt mean he is an unbeatable juggernaut that beats all styles of fighting there are matchups out there that will be bigger tests to mm at flyweight although cody is a big time test for sure
MMA,not_removed,yeah i can see him at that weight between camps but cody at is his pre water cut weight an thats what were talking about
MMA,not_removed,people also forget thats a big reason mightymouse doesnt love people pushing the superfight thing dj is a small flyweight even in camp hes around out of camp hes no bigger than according to him on stream while a lot of bantamweight guys walk at dodson moved up because he was cutting a lot he made weight but again on stream dj mentioned he heard jon dodson was walking at like for bantamweight
MMA,not_removed,what do you mean by that
MMA,not_removed,lol and than dj butterflied and sat up into henry like he was a child than proceeded to kick him off and scramble up keep in mind henry has two gold medals
MMA,not_removed,i dont think mm wants anything to do with cruz again cruz won a ud with one hand
MMA,not_removed,especially since fans try not to acknowledge him being one of the greatest ever if history says it thats what matters to him
MMA,not_removed,i mean aldo was the champion for the longest time aldos ppv numbers were always pretty bad however i would say that conor brought new life to the division well have to see things change fast lhw used to be a almost guaranteed minimum for title fights but things have changed i feel like garbrant might just end up being a real popular figure
MMA,not_removed,im not speaking for myself im speaking for the masses most people just dont care to see him fight
MMA,not_removed,this isnt about personal preference were discussing ppv sales mighty mouse is my favorite fighter but hes not a draw
MMA,not_removed,sadly his stream isnt doing anything for his ppv numbers if he doesnt start promoting himself hard and talking trash i dont see him ever getting big views if hes the baddest dude at the weight class he needs to let every know not give happy go lucky interviews
MMA,not_removed,and dj got takendown at will my cruz who was getting reversed by cody so im not really sure what you are arguing
MMA,not_removed,he was behind me in line once at jersey mikes and spoke to him about pride hes an awesome dude
MMA,not_removed,is his right armshoulder doing better now he had a very badly pinched nerve in his neck and his arm was mostly unusable apparently
MMA,not_removed,heel to the balls heel to the balls
MMA,not_removed,his youtube videos are legit
MMA,not_removed,my what giant painful looking fists bas has
MMA,not_removed,bas is my favorite
MMA,not_removed,thats a cool shirt he had on
MMA,not_removed,i dont mean this in a negative way he looks fuckin lit right there lol very cool for you dude happy belated cake day bas seems like such a totally down to earth dude probably helps that even at his age with a pinched shouldernerve hes closer to a superhero than of the damn population how trippy must it be to go almost anywhere in the world any room any store any stadium and know youre almost guaranteed the baddest mother fucker in a mile radius
MMA,not_removed,i wanted to go but couldnt justify the cost considering it wasnt about a primary interest
MMA,not_removed,was this pic before or after he punched you in the liver
MMA,not_removed,is his right arm getting back to normal size
MMA,not_removed,hell yeah hes super cool super funny he signed for and posed with everyone there even though he had to catch a flight directly after
MMA,not_removed,he was recently on jre and he says it gets better bless el guapo
MMA,not_removed,yeah he was swinging it just fine haha
MMA,not_removed,first think i noticed too that dude has cinder blocks attached to his wrists
MMA,not_removed,i can understand that it was a dope experience though probably wouldnt have paid more than i did its just the fact that hes a legend
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt be standing there posing for a picture if it had been after lmao
MMA,not_removed,i think he said hes also getting surgery and injecting stuff maybe
MMA,not_removed,he is indeed a mountain of a man i wouldnt ever want to stand on the opposite side of the ring from him haha
MMA,not_removed,yeah wouldve been cool but just couldnt get a lot out of cage fighting techniques and striking techniques when im barely capable of throwing basic combos proficiently one day ill meet el guapo
MMA,not_removed,for hours
MMA,not_removed,it was only but with travel to chicago and much of it was for mma which i dont blame him for showing because i assume thats what people would want from bas it just isnt really my interest for myself
MMA,not_removed,for real hahah i need to do one of his seminars some time bas is one of my all time favorites
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say hes my idol but hes a legend and ive been watching him in mma forever he definitely knows his stuff i would definitely go if you get the chance
MMA,not_removed,when he acknowledges that if you dislike uriah faber something is wrong with you and that there wasnt any hard feelings between the of them after the altercation after the weigh in i smiled
MMA,not_removed,lol that artem one is hilarious
MMA,not_removed,somethings wrong with dominic cruz
MMA,not_removed,suprised stann didnt think rory would be back in the ufc if rory goes on a tear in bellator and raises his stock i could easily see him come back to the ufc he is young and without a doubt elite so no reason he could not come back if he so chose
MMA,not_removed,those are some passive aggressive shots at rory
MMA,not_removed,stann seems pretty dismissive of rory here
MMA,not_removed,he could have stayed in the ufc if he wanted historically the ufc has been unkind to people who leave on their own or shop around
MMA,not_removed,im sorry but it is ridiculous that the ufc is so prude towards anything bellatorrelated its gotten to the point where eddie alvarez and will brooks arent even introduced as former bellator lightweight champions when buffer rolls their credentials youd think that would be a pretty important thing to mention when introducing a fighter they mention strikeforce pride ect but anything that has to do with bellator they treat it like the plague i mean is it so toxic that you cant even mention it
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt want to get helwanid
MMA,not_removed,yea very dismissive seems like stanns ties to ufc really showed
MMA,not_removed,rampage came back gil shopped around and got a good deal from the ufc i know theres more but its been pretty much the only bellator associated fighters that got shit on big time were tito and randy as far as i know
MMA,not_removed,ufc bought pride and strikeforce so its under the ufc umbrella bellator is its own thing and i get that they dont want to recognize it it is really petty though
MMA,not_removed,does bellator introduce benson henderson as the former ufc champion
MMA,not_removed,ufc pulls some real mafia like bullshit with their fighters to keep them in line hope the fighters assoc challenges that
MMA,not_removed,wand had a petty hard time leaving too if i remember right but then they didnt have any trouble keeping crocop retire and switch he must have had a better contract or they dont want to piss off a counter terrorist who can decapitate you with a high kick
MMA,not_removed,yea i thought stann would be above that but him saying rory would never be ufc champ is just plain false the ufc smear campaign is in full effect
MMA,not_removed,anyone have a link to his twitch
MMA,not_removed,blessed is gay ass name
MMA,not_removed,wwwtwitchtvblessedmma
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,looks like the trainer was getting the better of that exchange i was kind of hoping the trainer would knock him out
MMA,not_removed,that fucking left the boxer that won the fight was like oh shit after that landed
MMA,not_removed,trainer has sick hands
MMA,not_removed,when it comes to boxing is that a bad stoppage shouldnt he have gotten a standing count
MMA,not_removed,coach caught him rocked him even when he was coming in nice
MMA,not_removed,great punch rocked him but you also have to take into consideration he has expended a lot of energy throughout his boxing match
MMA,not_removed,title has it backwards the corner guy threw the first shot hope they ban the guy for life
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,dont hook with a hooker
MMA,not_removed,it also looked like he was starting it so i was kind of hoping he would get knocked out
MMA,not_removed,he nearly took his head off
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say bad plus you cant judge it off that clip
MMA,not_removed,generally when the ref waves off a fight without giving a fighter a standing count its because the fighter is out on his feet this occurs almost always against the ropes in boxing when a fighter gets knocked out the ref separates for the knock down and then generally waves the fight during the count when its clear the fighter can no longer continue or just count out the if its clear the fighter cant get back on his feet however because you can only really separate the fighters when someone is knocked down it creates a scenario where someone could be out on their feet probably against the ropes and the ref can only give him an count if he steps in after the fighter hits the ground in this case the ref steps in after the clean shot to the head which to me seems pretty reasonable however the fighter wasnt out although what the ref did was fine as the defending fighter wasnt really intelligently defending himself it is generally accepted in boxing circles that a boxer should be given an eight count if possible and let him get back up seeing as we didnt see the rest of the fight im going to assume that the guy got dominated and the ref called the fight at the point because hes seen enough
MMA,not_removed,still had enough energy to bumrush the cornerman and talk shit run up get done up i guess
MMA,not_removed,true that no gloves on either but the guy had his hands down so i dont think it would have made any difference how tired he is
MMA,not_removed,throwing and landing are two different things the fighter threw first but the corner landed first interception is a form of selfdefense
MMA,not_removed,no watch it again the boxer throws a left first
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,damn leon snatchin rear nakeds like its nothing
MMA,not_removed,referee seems like a knob the cornerman was leaving and he went up to him he grabbed the cornerman then he punched him what did the cornerman do to deserve that
MMA,not_removed,shoved him
MMA,not_removed,the shove after the ref followed him and grabbed his arm
MMA,not_removed,grabbed his arm do you mean pointing at him and maybe touching his shoulder with a neutral open hand we dont know what happened in there and what was said all i know is that cornerman laid hands on the ref and in my opinion the ref had every right to react you dont have to agree but i didnt see the ref grab his arm
MMA,not_removed,you may have missed it the ref grabs the guys left arm a little after the tap on the shoulder do you not think the reaction was a little excessive or that the referee made more of the situation by following the cornerman when it seemed like he was about to leave i agree that the ref has the right to work without any abuse but to me without hearing what was said the left hook was over the top
MMA,not_removed,i think i see it looks like he grabs him down by the wrist or something i do agree though definitely an excessive gesture especially as youve stated it did look like the cornerman was leaving
MMA,not_removed,from what i understand the cornerman was upset at his fighter losing the referee didnt take kindly to what he was saying and grabbed him to pull him aside and talk to him cornerman shoves him while exchanging more words referee takes it as an immediate threat and sleeps him
MMA,not_removed,vs im taking fedor on this one
MMA,not_removed,just started listening and of course johnny hendricks is making bullshit excuses you know what i mean make since johny hendricks starts at tim kennedy starts at bas rutten starts at fedor vs politicians karim zidan starts at is ufc ppvworthy mike dyce starts at gsp vs bisping starts at uriah faber retirement starts at jack reacher review starts at top tom cruise movies starts at
MMA,not_removed,tom cruise
MMA,not_removed,what did hendricks say
MMA,not_removed,basically said the old hendricks is coming back and he has nothing to lose because he doesnt care anymore
MMA,not_removed,thanks personally i think hes finished he doesnt even have confidence in his own camp
MMA,not_removed,yeah my thoughts exactly dudes sounds defeated
MMA,not_removed,clickbait
MMA,not_removed,where did he cry i just see him hiding a sad face
MMA,not_removed,rather cry due to aldos retirement than due to finding ronda the hottest woman ever
MMA,not_removed,thats porra porra
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan can be a tool but he is nothing compared to luciano andrade or any brazilian commentator to be honest
MMA,not_removed,can you translate what aldo was saying
MMA,not_removed,gotta get those useless internet points
MMA,not_removed,youre not going to believe what this guy does when he hears that jose aldo is retiring
MMA,not_removed,he was choked up and sad but not crying one of the guys on the panel even joked saying he is going to cry
MMA,not_removed,its a long interview but he basically said he is really retiring not because he is not fighting mcgregor but because mcgregor is keeping the belt and is going to fight for the belt something that the ufc did not allow aldo to do against pettis some time ago he says this is putting down all the weightclass and that he fights for the joy and glory of fighting not for money because he is not a whore and since it is not joyful anymore he is retiring to try another sport he clearly specifies that the ufc should strip mcgregor of the belt so that he can fight anyone he wants to aldo doesnt care and if mcgregor wants to come back to as a contender after losing the belt he is more than welcome as if this would be the only condition that could change aldos head about retirement he also talks about gsp asking for to fight mcgregor but thats other news
MMA,not_removed,is this the same interviewtranslation that was posted yesterday
MMA,not_removed,he had enough exp to evolve after beating rory
MMA,not_removed,meth not even once
MMA,not_removed,you fool this isnt even my final form
MMA,not_removed,omg a giant qtip
MMA,not_removed,where were you when ufc rolled into msg grandpa well sonny i was on my phone applying for welfare because i sold everything to be able to afford to go
MMA,not_removed,ill probably be drunk so i hope i remember
MMA,not_removed,ill be sat infront of my computer most likely
MMA,not_removed,ill remember paying ridiculous prices for nosebleeds
MMA,not_removed,mission accomplished
MMA,not_removed,if this card holds together i doubt any mma fan will ever forget
MMA,not_removed,the atmosphere will be electric i hope it can match which imo has been the card of the year so far is
MMA,not_removed,this thing is a month away my body is ready for more surprises
MMA,not_removed,i just realized liz carmouche was in the first female ufc fight and first female ufc title fight and now shes going to be the first female mma fighter and the first mma fighter to fight at msg also i still wish robbie was fighting on this card just to make it that more epic
MMA,not_removed,yeah well a lot of people are gonna remember it as the card that cost us aldo unless you get your shit together fast dana still though its an awesome card would be fun if they did go the route with a different coloured mat maybe blue
MMA,not_removed,im not sure how much ill remember probably be up til to watch it and the haze of exhaustion will take most of my memories
MMA,not_removed,i hope they bring back the yellow mat you know its big then
MMA,not_removed,and yet tons of people on here were talking about how its not a big deal they wont get the big main event or that three title fights was impossible as if it wasnt blatantly obvious they at least wanted a mcgregor type star power
MMA,not_removed,i do not believe this man
MMA,not_removed,neverforget
MMA,not_removed,please make sure to upgrade those data plans on your smart devices to consume the craziness that will flood internets and social media seriously i enjoy the benefitslike cell phones but i fucking hate the kind of quote seen here the future is mildly retarded
MMA,not_removed,makes people remember
MMA,not_removed,i think this will break mil ppv
MMA,not_removed,he better hope there is no repeat of ufc that would be a bad memory
MMA,not_removed,walk in fuck shit up and then walk out deal with it
MMA,not_removed,likely asleep time difference is a bitch
MMA,not_removed,i mean they act as if the card wasnt in new york then anyone who loves there wouldnt know what the ufc was
MMA,not_removed,get this trash off the first page a page of text that amounts to garbage
MMA,not_removed,i thought to myself finally a huge card close to home with no expensive plane tickets or hotel required as i logged into ticketmaster my hopes were immediately dashed when i saw the cheapest tickets cost over a grand will just have to get it on ppv
MMA,not_removed,ill be in front of my tv cause the tickets are to damn expensive
MMA,not_removed,apparently he didnt sell his phone
MMA,not_removed,where were you when ufc rolled into msg grandpa i was spamming aldo highlight videos with seconds ð
MMA,not_removed,if u dint u get to watch it twice with the excitement both times
MMA,not_removed,it will be the first card i ever watch that isnt a shitty stream and i am pumped
MMA,not_removed,you got tickets what section and what did they run you couldnt find any pair of seats south of
MMA,not_removed,yeah well a lot of people are gonna remember it as the card that cost us aldo unless you get your shit together fast dana nah you only think that because thats the hottest news today in months people will remember the epic card when you think of not who quit mma
MMA,not_removed,like two days before the alvarez mcgregor fight was announced i actually had a dream that aldo left for bellator he even tweeted thanks for the cheddar in my dream just like conor lol
MMA,not_removed,what will we do without aldo fighting once a year to a decision also he may be making a lot of hay about retiring but after watching aldo for so long i cannot believe he would retire without a rematch to avenge his only loss in a decade dude has too much fight in him for that
MMA,not_removed,blue would remind me of wec and the loss of aldo c
MMA,not_removed,honestly i love aldo but if he really quits ill probably forget in a few months hopefully he finds a way to get to rizin or something
MMA,not_removed,dvr it
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised to see a blue mat
MMA,not_removed,please no that shit was hideous
MMA,not_removed,i see a lot of people starting posts with i mean these days i dont get it but its definitely become a thing this is the first time ive seen someone make a full sentence out of it
MMA,not_removed,im fortunate enough to know a fighter in the ufc who fought on cards at the prudential center and was able to get real good seats for cheap from him but now that ny has legalized i doubt theyll have many more in nj
MMA,not_removed,same here i forgot for a moment how msg works at least i will get to see them at press tours
MMA,not_removed,best seat in the house id love to go to a live event but lets be honest watching ppv on a comfy ass chaircouch with cheap delicious food and booze potentially some weed and then sleeping in your own bed after furiously masturbating is the shit
MMA,not_removed,thats my plans planned my annual friendsgiving for the same day all my friends over for a thanksgiving feast paired with this beast card
MMA,not_removed,winvomitwin
MMA,not_removed,rmmastreams brings quality streams
MMA,not_removed,gift from the wife around hundred
MMA,not_removed,casual fans just think hes a second scrub
MMA,not_removed,lol for real
MMA,not_removed,as a uk guy its just not the same live or bust for me
MMA,not_removed,yeah youre probably right prudential center and msg are only like miles apart from each other so it just makes more sense to have those cards in ny from now on
MMA,not_removed,msg is incredibly expensive to run shows in its why wwe no longer or rarely does televised shows from there theyll definitely keep prudential for the smaller fight night cards especially since nassau coliseum closed barclays is also bigger than prudential and fight nights dont even come close to selling out at the latter i think its gonna be fine
MMA,not_removed,i had chinese and switched screens for the main card
MMA,not_removed,i went to a live event cowboy vs rda in orlando and sat relatively close to the ring but you pretty much just watch the tvs anyway the guys are so small and the fence and ring blocks your view the tvs are the way to go the atmosphere wasnt even that great either couple fights broke out in the seats a few times which was exciting but the fans themselves were just annoying with all the weeeeewing and i dont even drink so buying expensive shitty beer wasnt even an option for me all in all im glad to say ive been to a ufc event just because i can say it but i dont see myself going to one again
MMA,not_removed,holy shit i also have a friendsgiving its better than family thanksgiving honestly
MMA,not_removed,wat seriously america friendsgiving when is shut your cakehole and buy shit day
MMA,not_removed,yeah i use that exclusively and they have sorted me out big time ive never missed an event but i always have to have three going in case one falters and im sitting at a desktop with earphones for five hours to watch fights on a semiblurry screen on a less than shit computer with less than shit broadband until am im excited to watch on a tv is all
MMA,not_removed,there doesnt seem to be anything here anyone else getting this
MMA,not_removed,those streams are so trash like who the fuck watches delayed streams
MMA,not_removed,i will hold you to that
MMA,not_removed,gift from the wife on the joint account
MMA,not_removed,understood i meant dvr it to be able to watch it again after you reemerge from your haze
MMA,not_removed,they can just do what the nfl does hold events in new jersey at lower cost while telling everyone its in new york
MMA,not_removed,i think theyre more likely to use barclays having live ppvtv shows from msg is apparently so expensive that even wwe doesnt do it anymore something with the price msg wants to broadcast from there
MMA,not_removed,they are miles apart
MMA,not_removed,i was worried this was going to be a pic of you furiously masturbating
MMA,not_removed,is that the steam controller thing looks so futuristic
MMA,not_removed,portable vape
MMA,not_removed,same here family thanksgiving is boring as shit friendsgiving is always a great time
MMA,not_removed,hahaha my friends and i were all getting older and with that busier we dont really get together as a group anymore as were all doing grown up things this is a day where i cook a thanksgiving meal and everyone makes the time to come together along with their kids and wives
MMA,not_removed,its thanksgiving but he spends it with his friends try to have a somewhat open mind its not all coors light and cheeseburgers over here
MMA,not_removed,and youll have guaranteed english audio which is nice
MMA,not_removed,whenever theres an event something gets posted when the event ends it gets taken down
MMA,not_removed,damn kid
MMA,not_removed,oh shit yeah sorry man good call wasnt sure what you meant
MMA,not_removed,risky click of the day
MMA,not_removed,def a great controller
MMA,not_removed,ya man its awesome i use it all the time
MMA,not_removed,ya its an arizer solo
MMA,not_removed,absolutely family thanksgiving usually involves drinks in secrecy and trying not to die of boredom friendsgiving has open drinking and me getting so drunk i force feed my friends mashed potatoes
MMA,not_removed,thats actually a nice sounding thing i might steal your idea for myself but ill give it a different name since i dont want to get hammered by snd that was pretty funny though
MMA,not_removed,ah thank you
MMA,not_removed,final question then what wine were you drinking
MMA,not_removed,haha sounds similar to mine last year we got drunk as hell after the kids went to sleep and ending up somehow playing just dance and michael jackson experience super shitshow of drunken singing and dancing
MMA,not_removed,lol the pic is from so i cant remember for sure but thats been my go to for the last little while
MMA,not_removed,the best times honestly we just had a newborn in march so this year might be a little tamer but who knows cheers to a good time
MMA,not_removed,nice one my man if you like prosecco and would occasionally like to splurge for something fancier youd probably love franciacorta basically italian champagne shits good yo
MMA,not_removed,i will definitely check that out if i can find it here good lookin out
MMA,not_removed,old video gerry dee is easily heavier now
MMA,not_removed,robin black with the babyface
MMA,not_removed,fat dillashaw
MMA,not_removed,wtf was that
MMA,not_removed,thats pretty typical for gerry dee hes a comedian who does a lot of interviews with athletes hes on tv a lot here in canada but i dont know if he gets much exposure in the rest of the world
MMA,not_removed,bessette should be in the ufc no question about it he has come up and trained with us and helped me and joe proctor get ready for ufc fights and its always a fight he has earned his spot and just needs a little help hes tough exciting dangerous well rounded and an awesome personality not sure what else they want
MMA,not_removed,the guy is a boss for taking that many shots and still stand
MMA,not_removed,jan at utc this is the third round and finish from my fight on friday thank you to zombieprophet for hooking me up with the clip mma fight worldchampion boxing kickboxing muaythai bjj striking striker ko knees ufc cesmma httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,good stoppage
MMA,not_removed,oh look im rocked should i try and move around and avoid contact to recover nah let me bang bro
MMA,not_removed,follow up interview
MMA,not_removed,beautiful finish but man that other dude is tough as hell some of those shots looked killer
MMA,not_removed,agree great fighter great guy and a great coach he deserves his shot he earned it
MMA,not_removed,dude is kevin croom surprised he lasted as long as he did
MMA,not_removed,when you look like food you get eaten
MMA,not_removed,never been rocked hard have you sometimes your brain and body dont communicate very well and your wind up doing stupid shit
MMA,not_removed,plenty of fighters get rocked and try and be evasive the first time he was clipped he made a choice to bang
MMA,not_removed,and if hed knocked him out youd be applauding him let him go out on his shield if thats the type of fighter he is and like i said being rocked like that sometimes you dont realise what you are doing straight away his fightflight instinct kicked in and his said stand your ground and fight
MMA,not_removed,no i wouldnt i hate this stupid let me bang bro mentality the only reason people do it is because they dont have any real technical skills

MMA,not_removed,quite shocking that you overlooked connor mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,not criticizing you at all but im curious what about phil davis makes him one of your favorite fighters i like all your other picks a lot but phil davis is someone i have a hard time getting excited about
MMA,not_removed,never seen a phil davis fan before i just cant seem to like the guy even though i want to hes boring but has out of this world athleticism
MMA,not_removed,nice to see mvp here
MMA,not_removed,igor was such a beast one of the alltime greats in my book
MMA,not_removed,yeah he has a school in nyc really good coach and nice guy he was ranked number one at when i started watching mma i havent read bjs book but im assuming he said some nice things he loves shaolin
MMA,not_removed,seriously i dont think people realize what that dude comes from and to see him on top is amazing
MMA,not_removed,why
MMA,not_removed,id have him at right behind dada
MMA,not_removed,connor mcgreggor
MMA,not_removed,i became a fan after his win against boetsch his grappling is very unique and fun to watch
MMA,not_removed,wish vov had won the pride gp
MMA,not_removed,in an already weak division selfishly id hate to see this plus as a uk fan the better jimi does the better cards we will see over here i really hope this doesnt come off
MMA,not_removed,this absolutely should not happen
MMA,not_removed,im behind this way more than maymac lhw is a shitshow anyway not like it could make it worse
MMA,not_removed,remember when amir khan was talking about starting mma seems a lot of british boxers are considering it as lucrative
MMA,not_removed,dudeim a mma fan and i want to watch mma this shit wouldve made sense years ago when mma actually needed the exposure
MMA,not_removed,seems like all the boxers want it to be in boxing why dont they come to mma dont be scared homie
MMA,not_removed,for those that are not aware david haye is often full of shit
MMA,not_removed,why and why is the mma scene so inclined on give boxing a second life thats stupid
MMA,not_removed,david haye says the ufc are involved in putting together a card for mcgregor vs mayweather and youre calling it wolf tickets you have the iq of a potato
MMA,not_removed,boxing bout as for kan he is mental he is worth million dollars very few mma fighters are worth that
MMA,not_removed,theyre looking for a quick payday much like how regional mma fighters pick up the occasional boxing match against low level prospects between fights
MMA,not_removed,only one i really remember is team oyama edit also i guess you could check this list httpwwwfightresourcecommmaschoolscalifornia
MMA,not_removed,tomacelli academy in costa mesa has all that not sure if you want to make that drive though
MMA,not_removed,thanks i had come across team oyama but havent heard anything about them
MMA,not_removed,yeah its a bit far i will check it out though thanks
MMA,not_removed,god forbid we just let other people support who they wish we can all live on the same planet
MMA,not_removed,oct at utc make america great again httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,literally the only person who managed to change rmmas mind on kennedy is gastelum
MMA,not_removed,i gotta say i was hoping for moose
MMA,not_removed,releasethemoose
MMA,not_removed,cool im happy that tims finally getting a fight
MMA,not_removed,how is this different than when other athletic commissions will honor any penalty the nsac gives out why is the ufc willing to overstep the nysac ban of kg for months
MMA,not_removed,for the interim title
MMA,not_removed,fuck that set the moose loose instead
MMA,not_removed,says a lot about this card that planned fight probably happening is considered news
MMA,not_removed,with how this card has played out and the variable of kelvins reliability i will believe it when i see it
MMA,not_removed,yes
MMA,not_removed,sweeeet
MMA,not_removed,good news for kennedy otherwise he had mousasi on short notice haha
MMA,not_removed,the moose on suicide watch
MMA,not_removed,let the moose loose
MMA,not_removed,i want to see kelvin get put up against cain or rumble you know as a form of punishment for being a whiny fat douche who thinks its ok to throw fighters pay checks away
MMA,not_removed,lol if mini cain wins
MMA,not_removed,kennedy is going to tool fatbody up
MMA,not_removed,i know people are killing kelvin right now rightfully so but im hoping for a win from him here hes got a great heart but terrible professionalism hopefully he keeps getting better and better as his career progresses hes got the johnny hendricks disease
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcqinjmqmeso
MMA,not_removed,hes probably going to miss weight now because he thought the fight wasnt going to happen and that he could eat whatever he wanted
MMA,not_removed,rip gastelum
MMA,not_removed,good kelvin deserves whats coming to him
MMA,not_removed,yawn
MMA,not_removed,the bad news kevin started stress eating as soon as he heard it might be off
MMA,not_removed,teamfatass
MMA,not_removed,will gastelum stay away from the fries to make
MMA,not_removed,i was like wtf hold up isnt this weekend almost shit my self
MMA,not_removed,kennedy is a whiner but he always shows up and makes weight unlike that fat fuck gastelum
MMA,not_removed,yeah i still dont like tim
MMA,not_removed,dont really keep up with kennedy why dont people like him
MMA,not_removed,nah fuck kennedy
MMA,not_removed,moose wouldnt fight tim because it isnt a a title fighta name that will propel him imo
MMA,not_removed,how great would it be to see an iranian born man wipe out tim kennedy
MMA,not_removed,dont jinx it
MMA,not_removed,they arent going to overstep it the implication here is that nysac have reconsidered and chosen to eliminate kelvins suspension not that ufcontario is going to ignore it and make the fight anyway
MMA,not_removed,in an mmafighting article it stated that this suspension was an administrative suspension which is a different typecategory apparently so the other commissions are not required to give it the same consideration as they usually do with the traditional punitive suspensions that is my impression anyhow
MMA,not_removed,ugh guys the undercard sucks but its also free the main card is totally solid had the main event not been scrapped it would have been great even we arent always going to get a replacement main event two weeks before the event it sucks that it happened but there is still a perfectly good main card filled with fights that are likely to be wars the idea that this card is a travesty is ridiculous its awesome that weve been on a legendary string of amazing ppvs but this card stacks up perfectly well with ufc ppvs historically and i would happily pay money to watch hollowaypettis cowboybrown and kennedygastelum not to mention swansonsuperboy if people want to get mad at anyone get mad at aka for continuing to have fighters pull out with training injuries had dc not been hurt this ppv would be fantastic
MMA,not_removed,hes gonna tko kennedy
MMA,not_removed,puts down cheeseburger wait you mean im not filling in for cormier at
MMA,not_removed,find out next time on another awesome episode of dragon ball z
MMA,not_removed,same
MMA,not_removed,says crazy shit does crazy shit
MMA,not_removed,he went on instagram i know this is hard to believe but its true and said that he had killed women and children non combatants while at war and that if you have ptsd you are just a pussy who isnt strong enough to handle war
MMA,not_removed,lmao people forget that tom kennedy is a civilian killer and the most insanely obnoxious babycryer in ufc history
MMA,not_removed,all the media reports say he offered tho also this would be the last fight in his contract so a win even if its against the number or whatever kennedy is ranked puts him in a position to renegotiate when two of the other top are out injured
MMA,not_removed,they should have jacare at weigh ins again
MMA,not_removed,do you have a source for them willing to ignore
MMA,not_removed,ontario were going to uphold it
MMA,not_removed,any examples
MMA,not_removed,wait what
MMA,not_removed,you dont blame a hammer for which nail he drove in and i disagree with most mid easternasian wars the us and west are in
MMA,not_removed,even if its against the number or whatever kennedy is ranked kennedy got dropped from the rankings for inactivity edit but i guess hes back now at so nevermind me
MMA,not_removed,moose said hes ready in case something happens
MMA,not_removed,well the ontario commission is as saying the oac honors all suspensions by members of the association of boxing commissions which seems pretty clear to me that if kelvin remains suspended they are definitely not letting him fight so based on that the only way the fight happens is if ny unsuspends kelvin
MMA,not_removed,he is speculating
MMA,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from but then that means the undercard wouldnt matter regardless to those people if they dont have the ability to watch a stacked undercard doesnt change anything youre not going to get cable just for the ufc and if you for some reason do youll continue to have it for every other event they put on tv but mostly youve either got the channels or you dont so its just an included bonus if you do fight pass is a great option and one bad undercard isnt a big deal when they have events almost every weekend now and the main draw for fight pass is the back catalogue anyway plus all the live non ufc events they air as well the point is theyre broadcasting the undercard out and no one who sees it had to pay anything extra to watch the main card is what you are paying for when you order a ppv so ultimately those are the fights that matter a good undercard is just a fun bonus it was only very recently that under cards stopped being filled with all unknown and unranked fighters anyway
MMA,not_removed,i dunno how globo and bt sports work in brazil and the uk but im guessing theyre not actually free you are very correct about bt sports
MMA,not_removed,off the top of my head with no context pulled a gun on usada made usada watch him shower said ptsd is for pussies
MMA,not_removed,nail what now
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,ergh what thats a horrifying mentality to have
MMA,not_removed,i was too lazy to check tbh
MMA,not_removed,what was he ranked when he got dropped whats the highest he was ranked
MMA,not_removed,false hes currently listed at httpwwwufccomrankings
MMA,not_removed,and why would the nysac unsuspend kelvin
MMA,not_removed,didnt tim pull the gun on that guy because he was getting very credible death threats from isis at the time he saw a suspicious car slowly rolling down his block then finally parking in front of his house i can see how a guy who has watched his friends burn alive due to war being a bitcautious in terms of the shower heres a direct quote from him last time i got tested like a week ago this guy came into my house and id just came back from a workout he was like we cant take blood for an hour and i was like well i just got done with a workout can i take a shower he said he had to visually keep his eyes on me the whole time so i was like well im taking a shower i walked into my bathroom took my clothes off and he walked into the bathroom with me and watched me shower he was like are you serious so i said shall i rinse again shall i use more soap are my balls clean he percent watched me im not going to sit there dirty after practice i think thats totally understandable considering how important it is to shower after practice not to mention hes probably use to showering next to naked dudes anyway in terms of ptsd being for pussies that i dont agree with at all
MMA,not_removed,damn
MMA,not_removed,very few normal soldiers were punished through that
MMA,not_removed,dont blame the tools for a bad craftsmans job i agree though kennedy is a complete cock
MMA,not_removed,youre over simplifying that situation to a dramatic extent
MMA,not_removed,putting responsibility where it belongs is horrifying to you the blame for war lies with those deciding to resort to it not the ones tasked with carrying it out
MMA,not_removed,apparently hes back now as but he was top ten before he was dropped i think top before the romero fight
MMA,not_removed,that must be recent but he was definitely not ranked for awhile there probably put him back when they booked him to fight rashad
MMA,not_removed,because kelvin and the ufc asked them to nicely i dont know really no one outside of the commission the ufc andor maybe kelvin knows the answer to that but him being unsuspended is definitely the implication that ariel is making with this tweet he said he hadnt got verification from ny yet though so who knows maybe kelvin is just feeding him some wishful thinking as though it is a fact
MMA,not_removed,maybe theyll come to their senses and start towing the line for suspensions that other athletic commissions already have set they literally suspended almost everyone for one reason or another who fought in
MMA,not_removed,because unlike other athletic commissions they are the only ones which suspend a fighter for not making weight or showing up to weighins not sure
MMA,not_removed,he was originally suspended for missing weight no they might be more lenient on his suspension if hes being forced up to a weight class
MMA,not_removed,i think you skipped the part about no context i dont hate tim he is kinda crazy though hope he smashes gastelum
MMA,not_removed,youre willing to absolve a man entirely for killing women and children because someone may have told him to do so do the circumstances matter to you at all or is it that cut and dry because if so then yes it is worrying
MMA,not_removed,dope i remember when he got dropped but couldnt remember what he was ranked thanks
MMA,not_removed,gastelums actually made sense though the dickhead didnt make weight and didnt even show up shit maybe he would have learned from it
MMA,not_removed,whywhy would you base your opinion on someone based off things they said with no context dont you think thats a little unfair unless youre just stating that this sub hates him for insane reasons
MMA,not_removed,which is how you end up in jail for desertiongoing awol in any countries army
MMA,not_removed,im not those are some of the things rmma notes i couldnt care less and again think he is a little off his rocker but after his specialized military service i dont blame him
MMA,not_removed,i totally agree with you dude of this sub couldnt handle half the shit that guy has been through
MMA,not_removed,at being punched in the head repeatedly
MMA,not_removed,million dollars would do that
MMA,not_removed,im not surprised its not a shocker just the answer to an unanswered question
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,hes been saying it since the event was announced
MMA,not_removed,gosh his stand up looks rough i am starting to think he may not land a single punch in the fight i bet the house its a first round ko good luck to him though i admire the effort
MMA,not_removed,why do people keep downvoting that his standup looks bad its easy to tell he isnt a natural at it he still has no idea how to turn his body into it his punches they look really awkward
MMA,not_removed,this ass whoopin helped robert take his game to another level hasnt lost since
MMA,not_removed,crazy how off whittaker looked at and how amazing he looks at weightclass changes can work wonders i hope he wins the belt at some point
MMA,not_removed,damn got completely outclassed
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,delusional aussies is for the big boys and whittaker is a fringe top ww his win against brunson doesnt mean shit and his uriah hall fight if you remember was one of the very worst last year how can you put robert whittaker and title in one sentence when hes fighting in the same div as guys like weidman or jacare
MMA,not_removed,what a constructive argument based in fact and reason
MMA,not_removed,in a division where bisping is champion dont count anybody out
MMA,not_removed,get out of here with your sound logic
MMA,not_removed,its funny and all until one catches you right and knocks you out and your chin is never the same again
MMA,not_removed,terrible decision
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say he enjoys it
MMA,not_removed,not really homeboy didnt do shit in round
MMA,not_removed,nunes hijacking rmma comments from a year ago
MMA,not_removed,wheres herb dean he needs to stop this brutal beating
MMA,not_removed,stop he is already dead
MMA,not_removed,i think we understood what you were saying after the first time
MMA,not_removed,all i saw from this clip is that you should never eye poke rumble
MMA,not_removed,the end of to cowboy masvidal and the end to of silva v bisping are some other similar instances what are some other fights that included a ko but werent stopped
MMA,not_removed,falcaoharris falcao had harris in a deep rnc and for some reason the round ended like seconds early

MMA,not_removed,not surprising but still devastating also he just called out dominick cruz in his post fight speech id fucking watch that
MMA,not_removed,moraes vs eddie wineland how about that for a ufc debut fight
MMA,not_removed,last fight on his contract ufc open the wallet
MMA,not_removed,one of those kos that really scare you about ones health look at josh move on the floor
MMA,not_removed,i cant wait to see marlon moraes in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,hes definitely outgrown wsof cant wait for him to come to the ufc
MMA,not_removed,twitter videos should be banned
MMA,not_removed,is this the same josh hill who went on tuf and tried to just hold people against the cage for ten minutes
MMA,not_removed,wsof is better than people give credit i enjoyed the last fights on wsof as much as anything on ufc tonight well expect maybe matt brown getting his ass handed to him
MMA,not_removed,he just landed the same exact knockout as woodleys against koscheck on the night that woodley won the title
MMA,not_removed,great stoppage
MMA,not_removed,moraes really needs to get over to ufc
MMA,not_removed,great stoppage didnt give him a chance to land that hammer that makes me happy
MMA,not_removed,i like it
MMA,not_removed,about time him and michael page need to lay off the cans and step up to the next level so many champs from other organizations are doing well in the ufc would love some new blood
MMA,not_removed,for sure looked to me like he took the point of the knee right to the temple region followed by shin to the back of the ear followed by a few punches while out cold on his feet devastating
MMA,not_removed,great memory yes indeed it is the same josh although he has much polished his stall game since tuf
MMA,not_removed,i thought this wsof card was significantly better than that ufc card there are too many people that are ufc fans not really mma fans only sub
MMA,not_removed,did you have the almeidapalmer fight like one of the judges i thought it was almeida if not
MMA,not_removed,woodley punched kos though
MMA,not_removed,no he didnt
MMA,not_removed,id have to rewatch it to give a more accurate scoring but i did feel palmer did enough to pull off the win definitely not though
MMA,not_removed,yes he did lol
MMA,not_removed,but he was faking an injury to duck the unstoppable yoel according to this sub
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,walk it off champ
MMA,not_removed,jan at utc is it just me or is my leg a bit swollen lol httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot

MMA,not_removed,whats up with conor and his drug lord fetish
MMA,not_removed,respect for the flair brotha
MMA,not_removed,i have a feeling mcgregor is a huge fan of the mafioso rap era and lets it creep into his actual personality
MMA,not_removed,ugh i thought he dropped this silly meme
MMA,not_removed,preparing to lose in the round again
MMA,not_removed,fuck this stupid hating title a marketable star got a sponsorship deal and what youre mad
MMA,not_removed,following loss to bryan barberena dude thats weak
MMA,not_removed,did they type their own name in this post
MMA,not_removed,he no hespeck the heebok
MMA,not_removed,reebok probably got him for a better deal than if he had won
MMA,not_removed,bring on the hate
MMA,not_removed,great news marketable ufc fighters took a big hit with the new rebook deal so a fighter getting paid more in sponsorship money is great
MMA,not_removed,bad omen all fighters who have individual deals with reebok have recently lost besides joanna who could very well join the list after the claudia fight list includes conor mcgregor ronda rousey paige vanzant chris weidman joanna jedrzejczyk anthony pettis johny hendricks jose aldo and rory macdonald
MMA,not_removed,post couldve done without the salt i mean we watch mma were aware believe me good for the kid im sure any fighter coming off any result wouldve inked this he just got a good deal and took advantage of it and he looks good for their brand as a prospect and as a future star a lot of fighters have gotten sponsorships after losses and it doesnt mean sponsors approve them losing it just shows that they show promise and sponsors choose to do business with them
MMA,not_removed,abs two upset victories in a row i guess
MMA,not_removed,sage fan boy psa it is possible to dislike someone and not be jealous find a new defense
MMA,not_removed,haters gonna hate
MMA,not_removed,whats hateful about it is he not coming off a loss
MMA,not_removed,rebok a chinese knock off
MMA,not_removed,yeah you guys hate him cause hes just such a dick
MMA,not_removed,is there even sage fanboys anyways its pretty hard to anonymously complain on the internet about an attractive person receiving preferential treatment because they attractive without sounding jealous especially one who doesnt have much else to hate oni guess there is the religious stuff
MMA,not_removed,jon jones asks for a diffrent ref after fleeing the scene of head on collision with pregnant woman josh barnett seeks fight with roy nelson following being busted for hgh use conor mcgregor speaks on loss to nate diaz after punching nates hand at weigh in gsp ready to return to mma despite being a greasing cheater and after a clear robbery against johnny hendricks
MMA,not_removed,no just someone who gets how the world works
MMA,not_removed,lol wat
MMA,not_removed,its so weird to me how thats what it immediately has to boil down to for a lot of people im sure it plays a part to some degree but i dont think every person who has something even slightly negative to say about sage is jealous of him
MMA,not_removed,i dont hate him at all or even dislike him i just dont see the hype for a fighter with a clear hole in his ground game maybe in years hell put together some fights that make me a fan of his but right now i dont see why hes deserving of his hype
MMA,not_removed,youre being a bit sensitive if you think its the same thing losses in the sport happen dont take it so personal he did lose his last match
MMA,not_removed,my post was to demonstrate that even though it is true that is a strange way to phrase the title mentioning a loss when its completely irrelevant is some hater shit im sorry if that offends you
MMA,not_removed,its kind of not irrelevant though when you consider the ufc athletes that do have exclusive reebok deals none of the previous deals were given to anyone coming off a loss that has nothing to with hate it doesnt offend me at all youre the one offended feeling the need to type out a buncha fake headlines to make this one seem equally as bad
MMA,not_removed,what a goof dana probably
MMA,not_removed,joanna would murder angela
MMA,not_removed,i think its just posturing and trying to build angela lee up as someone to that level of joanna when it comes down to it there will be so many commercial issues that makes cross promotion difficult and unless one of the two jumps to the other promotion we are unlikely to see them fight
MMA,not_removed,joanna would murder angela at this stage this is the bullshit one blurts out during quiet weeks for click bait it is silly just like when they said they would have weekly events just like when they said they would do an etihad stadium in australia when theres about people in the whole country who knows what one is just like they keep telling us about their billion dollar valuation yet get a big investment of which means they are no where near even just like they keep saying they are the biggest sports property in asia yet ignore all the massive japanese baseballsoccer chinese soccer teams and much more its just clickbait
MMA,not_removed,ufc wasnt willing to budge on copromotion when it came to fedor what on earth are these guys smoking that makes them believe they would do this for angela lee
MMA,not_removed,if crosspromoting means sharing the revenue yea i highly doubt thats going to happen tried to do that with the ufc a while back and that ended horribly
MMA,not_removed,the ufc has nothing to gain from this its not like angela lee brings along a huge new fanbase she has a few fans but very likely all of those fans already know about the ufc the only reason the ufc would pay one for this cross promo fight would be if they would gain a ton of new fans
MMA,not_removed,they gotta let angela lee defend her fkin belt to a really dangerous brazilian striker first before even talking about lee vs jedrzejczyk
MMA,not_removed,one is more of a click bait website than promotion
MMA,not_removed,ufc should do this joanna would murder her over rounds and would give her a big push in asia itd be a low risk deal with huge dividends
MMA,not_removed,ridiculous thing happened to my friends and i we simply left comments of our opinion on the fantasy match up on onefcs facebook post they deleted our comments several times and eventually blocked us all we said was that angela doesnt stand a good chance against jj a million dollar company blocked me for having an opinion
MMA,not_removed,youd have to be out of your mind to do this angela lee is pretty damn good and shes she has all the time in the world to improve and get better why would you throw into this caliber of fight already i think one has done and continues to do a really good job finding legitimately talented opposition for lee theyre not feeding her bums shes fight legit people i think she is being built up in the perfect way why interrupt that as urealpdd said i think hes posturing
MMA,not_removed,dream on
MMA,not_removed,who da fook
MMA,not_removed,him saying this is like me saying id be open to having sex with an underwear model id be willing to accept winning lottery tickets and a ride on the space shuttle too ive never been the stumbling block in any of those its always the other party the reason i dont say it is because it makes no sense to give particular voice to the idea that id like things that i wont ever get
MMA,not_removed,theyll never do another cross promo especially after sending chuck over to pride and him getting murked by rampage
MMA,not_removed,he accidentally bought his own hype
MMA,not_removed,he can keep dreaming there is absolutely no upside to that fight for jj and ufc
MMA,not_removed,heather jo clark would murder angela she doesnt even need to be spoken about in the same breath as joanna right now
MMA,not_removed,theres a very good chance lee submits her she couldnt strike with joanna champion but grappling is her bread and butter and shes nasty
MMA,not_removed,yeah cross promotion is hard hboshowtime posturing was one of the last things holding up maypaq
MMA,not_removed,yeah i think this is just that winwin for him if they fight hes in line to make a lot of money if it doesnt happen he can continue to oversell lee as a real worldbeater
MMA,not_removed,posturing implies bluffing i dont think its posturing i think its just a silly winwin scenario for one thats unrealistic its like talking about what youd do if you won the lottery its easy and costs you nothing of course hed love it to happen and of course the ufc has next to no reason to consider it
MMA,not_removed,ive never watched angela lee fight just heard the hype are you exaggerating or do you really think hjc would kill her people were building angela up like shes a serious talent
MMA,not_removed,lets not be silly lee is a jiujitsu brown belt claudia gadelha won the bjj worlds three times as a brown belt is a far more accomplished grappler and fighter in general its not comparable angela would get devoured by joanna
MMA,not_removed,while this is true more than a decade ago sakuraba demonstrated against probably the most dangerous grapplerssub artists of that era that fights always starts standing up i mean i love angela and i want one to succeed but this aint happening
MMA,not_removed,her next opponent is going to be a decent size brazilian whose a muay thai specialist
MMA,not_removed,i dont think hjc would struggle with her even slightly at this point her striking is awful and basically nonexistent she cant wrestle and her grappling is good but a bit sloppy and she gives up position to go after subs often to be fair to her shes only and has been fighting for years so she is a fairly interesting prospect shes just not very good yet
MMA,not_removed,joanna is a monster with amazing td defense but lee is very slick indeed in mma grappling look at her fights
MMA,not_removed,and claudia isnt claudia was able to get the take down and do nothing with it against joanna you have to look at the level of competition your anti ufc biases is crazy sometimes
MMA,not_removed,ive watched her recent two shes a great scrambler and a very natural grappler but frankly i dont think the fight even hits the mat lee doesnt have the power nor technicality to force joanna into her area of expertise even in the beginning of her fight with mei yamaguchi she had great difficulty getting the takedown against someone whose whole gameplan relied on clinching with her if we were to match joanna and angela up tomorrow it would be depressingly similar to the esparza fight where angela is unable to get any kind of offence going and gets slaughtered on the feet joanna tkos her inside
MMA,not_removed,lets see her fight somebody at least the same size as her and as skilled as her first
MMA,not_removed,yeah i didnt want ronda to win particularly but her losing like this its more sad than anything
MMA,not_removed,it was even better this time
MMA,not_removed,cool
MMA,not_removed,she did it to herself bullies deserve to be humiliated
MMA,not_removed,didnothing bitch
MMA,not_removed,def a fair point that she handled her loss terribly and it did her no favors
MMA,not_removed,dana said that he liked that fight and will figure something out for them too
MMA,not_removed,theres a ton of exciting guys moving up the ranks right now between the leech jason knight mirsad bektic makwaini new signings like tom duesquenoy sp marc diakiese choi and even some wild cardsdark horses like larkin masvidal gastelum mousasi whittaker beneil dariush etc even tim elliot being back excites me then the potential weight division changes happening its a very exciting time to be a fan and some very good matchmaking to come im sure edit how could i have forgotten platinum perry
MMA,not_removed,whats the backstory on the leech nickname is he known for his grappling interesting choice for a name even though i get that it rhymes with his last name i could see people making fun of it saying he has a leechreach advantage i wonder if he gave that name to himself or some person in the us did when he started the ufc
MMA,not_removed,are asians immune to head trauma they seem to be able to take so many clean headshots i mean look at sakuraba he shows no visible signs of brain damage and he took so much punishment in pride and then theres the doo ho choi fight
MMA,not_removed,that was a rough fight definitely fotn it looked like nash was taking control but li toughed it out and took control great battle
MMA,not_removed,gong xi fa cai
MMA,not_removed,any reason why a fotn wasnt given out i know money isnt an issue lol
MMA,not_removed,good hustle from the ref
MMA,not_removed,chinese product has never been this tough
MMA,not_removed,they were throwing some rocks
MMA,not_removed,always liked the leech since i first saw him in legend fc
MMA,not_removed,li channeling his inner bj penn there for a second with the glove lick
MMA,not_removed,definitely deserved it great scrap leech needs to work on his defense though
MMA,not_removed,forever reading his name as jingaling
MMA,not_removed,in case people didnt figure it out jingliang is his given name and li is his surname asian cultures usually put their surname first before the given name
MMA,not_removed,hell reward them with a generous offer of worth of gift cards from reebok from participating retail stores only stores are participating
MMA,not_removed,free one year subscription to fight pass for both
MMA,not_removed,dana whites lil bitchass should of just hurry the fk up and gave them fight of the night
MMA,not_removed,dude was licking blood of his gloves
MMA,not_removed,apparently it was for his grappling i believe from what i heard when he used to fight in legend a lot of china top team fighters are known to have nasty guillotines as well his grappling isnt on the level of a lot of the elite guys in his division but it was pretty good compared to many chinese fighters i was impressed by the improvements he made to his grappling in general such as his take down defense and submission defense itll be a really significant thing when he brings all this knowledge back to china and teaches it to other fighters i think the leech is going to bring chinese mma to another level
MMA,not_removed,i missed that fight i will look at it thanks
MMA,not_removed,he probably has a weibo chinese twitter since twitter is banned over there right but since thats in chinese i cant search for it lol
MMA,not_removed,as an asian no were regular humans
MMA,not_removed,im asian and my theory is that its because we have big heads or at least i do
MMA,not_removed,cruz and garbrandt knocked mizugaki into next week
MMA,not_removed,yushin okami disagrees with your hypothesis
MMA,not_removed,wont last forever look at gomi
MMA,not_removed,its all the cigarettes they smoke nicotine has neuroprotective properties i test helmets at work and were required to have a minimal blood nicotine level of ngdl because of this
MMA,not_removed,confirmation bias ask dong hyun kim mizugaki okami caol uno or akiyama
MMA,not_removed,mongoloid subjects were found to have approximately higher bone density at the angle of mandible than caucasoid subjects
MMA,not_removed,because the bonuses are just used to hold power over the fighters
MMA,not_removed,its extremely odd generally fotn isnt given out when there isnt an exciting fight and they opt for four performance of the nights but i thought this was a clear fotn
MMA,not_removed,it might have been a combination of the knockout and absolute exhaustion its rare you see a guy as completely drained as he was near the end
MMA,not_removed,and the gift cards expire an hour after theyre given out
MMA,not_removed,one convenient locationin africa
MMA,not_removed,dont forget free tickets behind a pillar at the next ufc event
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,yeah there was some good sprawling action in that vid also when the guy tried to get the takedown leech grabbed a leg instead of letting it happen interesting stuff cant wait to see more
MMA,not_removed,as another asian no were regular humans
MMA,not_removed,good grades
MMA,not_removed,takeya in his prime was a god damn warrior before he lost his chin the dude was as fearless as they come
MMA,not_removed,this is so outta left field im inclined to believe it
MMA,not_removed,jesus christ i must be invincable
MMA,not_removed,this doesnt sound right but i dont know enough about the neuroprotective properties of nicotine to dispute it
MMA,not_removed,bro science always explains everything
MMA,not_removed,that doesnt sound right to me
MMA,not_removed,i am sea and have a melon as a head although i am pretty short
MMA,not_removed,calm down himmler
MMA,not_removed,it absolutely was fotn dont know wtf dana and the owners were thinking
MMA,not_removed,not valid on sale or clearance items
MMA,not_removed,both of them thanks for the cheese uncle dana we are retired now
MMA,not_removed,also am asian can confirm am human w regular bones and stuff
MMA,not_removed,cold most of the east asia youre thinking of gets quite hot
MMA,not_removed,huh
MMA,not_removed,also not valid on shirts shorts pants shoes socks jackets posters water bottles or anything with the name reebok
MMA,not_removed,lmao all these asians pretending they dont possess chi magic
MMA,not_removed,am asian have metal plate for a chin replaced the fragile human bone when i was because physics decided to obliterate it also have been knocked out in nonrelated combat sports
MMA,not_removed,am asian i got super cyborg limbs and shit out suzukis on the daily
MMA,not_removed,as a nonrobot i too have bones
MMA,not_removed,final asian there are billions of us
MMA,not_removed,i thought asains had the lowest test levels which would also play a part
MMA,not_removed,it takes time to build the chakra i meani eaty i trainy i sleepy
MMA,not_removed,shh dont tell them our secret
MMA,not_removed,story time plz i want to know how you got kod and what you were playing
MMA,not_removed,also doesnt sound right to me
MMA,not_removed,push ups sit ups squats and running every single day
MMA,not_removed,hopefully this isnt considered brigading but everyone should tweet him at and let him know that we appreciate all the hard work he has put in these long years he might not have been the best we might have bagged him but i bet its a hard life being away from family doing all of the promo work press conferences and behind the scenes work that goes into his job thanks goldie its been real
MMA,not_removed,i was hoping for a nice send off between him and joe at the end
MMA,not_removed,i love that the last thing he said was a congratulations to belt winners cody and dom cruz classic goldie to the end
MMA,not_removed,yeah i am bummed he did say some tributes to people at the very end of the ppv but i agree he should have had more of a sendoff
MMA,not_removed,we should make a collage
MMA,not_removed,fook the ufc for not appreciating goldie
MMA,not_removed,man i wandered into the world of ufc my buddies were big wec fans and i just tagged along i was always a massive footysoccer fan but mma has taken over goldie has been omnipresent for my whole mma experience it made me feel ill the lack of acknowledgment for the man tonight he has leant a voice to my whole journey lets fly the flag from the best group of fans
MMA,not_removed,i just think that in such a burgeoning sport a man who has spent a large portion of his professional announcing career working for the ufc deserves some fucking respect feels like he was eeked out of the whole situation and i wont be too happy with the future
MMA,not_removed,both fights in which he was competitive for a notable period
MMA,not_removed,look at romeros trap muscle it looks like a fucking head growing out of his shoulder god damn that guy takes a lot of steroids
MMA,not_removed,hes still my boy
MMA,not_removed,thanks for posting a photo of what it looks like when my heart breaks twice i try to not get emotionally invested in fighters but ive followed chris from the start and knew hed be champion i love that dude and to see the amount of blood he lost in both those fights just kills me i really like moose but i think he is about to catch a beating
MMA,not_removed,weidman becoming one of my favorites just because he really does fight the best and is in it for the competition and true sport of it the ufc needs more guys like him
MMA,not_removed,and its gonna be in a row the next monster moose is loose and ready to go
MMA,not_removed,now that mw is fucked are there chances of guys leaving for bellator not sure about their contract situations etc
MMA,not_removed,whose physique is better romero or rockholds
MMA,not_removed,not to mention usada
MMA,not_removed,i dont like his chances with moose either if weidman does lose he should move up and make a run at lhw he is a pretty big mw and i think he can definitely make a run
MMA,not_removed,even three in a row when you fight the future champ
MMA,not_removed,and hes now fighting mousasi a guy jacare openly said is the only guy in the division he doesnt want to fight jacare ill tell you the truth the only guy in the ufc i truly dont want to fight is gegard mousasi because hes trouble
MMA,not_removed,he shouldve trained off his back
MMA,not_removed,and his next fight is versus mousasipoor weidman
MMA,not_removed,hes still my boy
MMA,not_removed,i think with the experience he has he is slightly better but you are right these guys are all the best at the moment its hard to know for sure chris is having a trifecta of trouble
MMA,not_removed,its a shame really this could be arguably the best division of the ufc imagine all the great titlefights we missing right now i thought the hendo thing was a one time weird move but now wtf come you are robbing your fans of great fights
MMA,not_removed,aka you might lose in a row when there are people in your division that are better than you
MMA,not_removed,mousasi is way more dangerous than ether of these chris is going from undefeated to straight losses
MMA,not_removed,lmao everybody riding weidmans dick dude has the shittiest cardio in the world you could see it in both silva fights quit making excuses to why he lost maybe he doesnt have it
MMA,not_removed,yoel romero is a cheateroso
MMA,not_removed,lost to rockhold on a brain fart and to yoel on a freak athletic move not much to complain about
MMA,not_removed,hes clean
MMA,not_removed,he never popped for steroids he unfortunately got some supplements that were tainted not steroids
MMA,not_removed,were like the total opposite i hate weidman and his stupid face for no rational reason and these pictures make me so happy in reality though i still feel like we have no idea where weidman ranks as a fighter he held his own with luke and even for a bit with yoel who are legitimately two of the best and he beat silva twice but i dont think either of those fights provides much insight at all
MMA,not_removed,idk i predict a smothering round ud win for chris andor gnp tko for the chris
MMA,not_removed,this is mousasis last fight on his deal id say there is a good chance he ends up in bellator rizin or somewhere else hes fought for coker before so there is a relationship there and bellators mw division is trash right now
MMA,not_removed,zero chance of luke or weidman leaving they have both tasted those sweet sweet ppv points and are gunning to get that belt back for a reason
MMA,not_removed,romero in terms of physique hes way more toned thick solid and tight however romero has a body men admire and rockhold has a body women and men admire
MMA,not_removed,tough question it is like a flavor question chocolate or vanilla depends on your mood am i right
MMA,not_removed,usada can not knee you in the face or force you to throw a lazy spin kick
MMA,not_removed,why dont people like weidman
MMA,not_removed,i think youd be surprised seriously though i wouldnt want weidman to be sacrificed to a monster like rumble
MMA,not_removed,not like thats an easier division though jones rumble dc and gustaffason would all be problematic for him
MMA,not_removed,tbh i think jacare said that cause he and the moose are good friends
MMA,not_removed,hey i also think mousasi is a very dangerous fighter but more than rockhold and yoel i mean were talking about the two arguably best mw in the world
MMA,not_removed,what about machida fight
MMA,not_removed,you mean both of those fights he won
MMA,not_removed,it wasnt just freak athletism he timed weidmans shot like the barboza knee
MMA,not_removed,i felt like i was on crazy pills after that fight it felt to me like rockhold was winning the fight before the kick i was texting my friend who couldnt watch both of us having bet on rockhold telling him that we were looking great and i was loving our chances but ask this sub and weidman was absolutely beating the shit out of rockhold before he made a mistake that rockhold luckily was able to capitalize on by some fluke
MMA,not_removed,no he did not lose to rockhold because he threw that kick
MMA,not_removed,being finished twice in a row is a huge issue when youre one of the highest paid guys on the roster
MMA,not_removed,hurdur so youre saying he was winning until he was not winning durhur i hate when people say that yes i am saying he was winning until he made a huge mistake and then lost
MMA,not_removed,disappointed that wasnt the troll pic
MMA,not_removed,even his cheek muscle is bulging
MMA,not_removed,i hate it when my supplements give me the physique of someone years younger than me
MMA,not_removed,neither did lance armstrong
MMA,not_removed,he also beat the former lhw champion pretty handily
MMA,not_removed,sassy has good cardio and ground game he s not gonna sit there la oldman vitor and take gnp
MMA,not_removed,you dont think mousasi would want to stay in ufc under usada hes complained about steroids before
MMA,not_removed,darker skin accentuates musculature more hence why bodybuilders get tan af before going on stage
MMA,not_removed,true they cant but they can cause you to deflate and blame it on cutting beer out of your diet followed by looking rather average afterwards
MMA,not_removed,shattered the man the myth the legend that was anderson silva
MMA,not_removed,and because jacare just rekt him
MMA,not_removed,just because he won doesnt take away from his cardio he didnt lose the rockhold fight cause of the kick he was tired dead tired and rometo caught him cause romero is better but its ok gegard will destroy him and fan boys will come out from everywhere
MMA,not_removed,i agree but that would have ruined my compact sentence im not trying to take anything away from either yoel or rockhold who happens to be my favorite fighter and maybe the background on my phone maybe
MMA,not_removed,not only that but it was also mostly weidmans fault for shooting with his head on the wrong side
MMA,not_removed,i notice some pattern here weidman kept shooting at olympic wrestler got kneed instead he deserved it he also spinning kicked kicker like rockhold and got taken down he will jab with mousasi next and got his own face reconstructed
MMA,not_removed,yeah i have no idea what fight these people were watching but luke was up on scorecards even before the kick its because weidman is a huge fan favorite on rmma while luke is not just like people continuing to say weidman was outgrappling him even though when he took lukes back in the he did nothing but when luke took his back after the kick he cut through him like butter and easily got to full mount before landing unanswered strikes luke showed that he is the far superior grappler and its still funny people are trying to use the kick as the reason weidman lost the kick led to luke getting his back thats it just like when weidman had lukes back in the if the kick led to a flash ko then i would understand it but it did not
MMA,not_removed,debatable
MMA,not_removed,yeah he got dominated on the ground i thought this was obvious anyone saying he lost because of a missed kick really makes no sense because youre either admitting if weidman gets his back taken he autoloses or missing kicks some how makes people lose
MMA,not_removed,vitor got finished in a row and makes way more money than weidman
MMA,not_removed,it pretty much is isnt it
MMA,not_removed,i see mousasi staying in the ufc and going for the belt dude strikes me as someone who still wants to fight the best of the best
MMA,not_removed,can we stop ignoring the fact that hes fighting the number fighters hes not deflating like eric silva or vitor hes not losing to the no names or has beens
MMA,not_removed,im not saying hes always been clean because he was a wrestler but weidman never had a holy shit physique deflating happens when you turn steroids or not
MMA,not_removed,better come up with a snappy way to say he got boxed up for minutes before the mosassi fight cant get across light heartedness in text so heres some emojis ðððð
MMA,not_removed,what you wrote was not a sentence
MMA,not_removed,he does that a lot ive noticed i wonder if he has devised some planstyle in which the wrong side isnt really wrong in mma context
MMA,not_removed,the reverse jbjgsp
MMA,not_removed,sure if youre a hardcore weidman fan
MMA,not_removed,never said he wasnt a top five guy but he was the number guy for someone who made against vitor getting finished twice is a huge hit hell never be a big ppv draw again
MMA,not_removed,vitor doesnt make way more than weidman vitor gets paid to show weidman gets to show the difference is that vitor commands more being a legend
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt be too sure he probably will want a clause in his new contract that guarantees a title shot in the reasonably close future at the very latest after he wins one more fight i doubt mous will risk getting stalled out for years until he loses when he has options in bellator and rizin both of which probably offer him more per non title fight than the ufc from their still short history in mma mousasi does not fit the wme mold of guys and girls they like to promote and in general the ufc has not been making a lot of counteroffers to fighters or even used their non compete clause hell they are letting ranked fighters go before they even fight out their contracts also just look at the current state of the mw title its likely that it will not be defended again against a legitimate contender until that is if the champion doesnt just retire or leave the weightclass which has a good chance of happening as well my guess would be the bispinggsp matchup will be at ufc in canada in september thats a year after the hendo fight after that gsp and bisping both are going to campaign for a champion vs champion fight and bisping could very well retire if he doesnt get it gsp would get that fight against the ww champ and he would keep the belt at least until after that fight he doesnt intend to defend it we could legitimately be talking about a midlate fight between contenders to crown a new champion you hear it quite a lot these days that fighters are becoming more and more unhappy with how the ufc is freezing out contenders they ask themselves if they are going to be the next romero jacare or maia where some suit who doesnt even watch mma i have heard so many stories in that direction about the new management by now that i assume this is true and at least a good number of fighters seem to figure that as well arbitrarily decides that they dont want you as champion because you dont fit into the mold of guys they like to promote and so no matter what you do you cannot get a title shot
MMA,not_removed,not taking anything away from the beasts hes fighting i am stipulating that it all adds up imo
MMA,not_removed,silva never had that holy shit type of physique yet people are always trying to rain on his records and proverbial parade because of being busted one time not saying these two are equal by any means i just think its a little suspect that before usada the dude was going hard rounds with machida and then cutting beer and shrinking caused him to look gassed in the round against rockhold and romero
MMA,not_removed,doesnt man up like mcgregor yup ive read enough
MMA,not_removed,not light enough no smiling poop emoji
MMA,not_removed,i actually still have a very bad taste in my mouth from the anderson fights but think he was pretty competitive up til the kick for sure the amount of blood that shot out of him after the yoel fight made me forget how good he did in that one
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,he might not be yours but hes still my boy
MMA,not_removed,weidman best the legend twice which makes him worth a lot because i guarantee if you beat gsp at the end of his run your championship renegotiation is worth a fuck ton more than beating woodley atm
MMA,not_removed,vitor makes way more in undisclosed pay
MMA,not_removed,lol thanks for that
MMA,not_removed,iv ban
MMA,not_removed,are you telling me nate diaz isnt a true welterweight
MMA,not_removed,ð©ð©ð©ð©ð©ð»ð»ð»ð»ð»
MMA,not_removed,competitive sure but using the kick to justify the loss takes away credit from rockhold who knows why weidman threw that kick maybe he felt desperate nobody knows all we know is that rockhold kicked the shit out of him after he threw it
MMA,not_removed,i like chris if he gets finished by moose hell make for a good bellator guy
MMA,not_removed,thats a huge assumption and you know it
MMA,not_removed,maybe back when lorenzo was around but my money is on the fact that things have changed since then
MMA,not_removed,im not trying to take anything away from rockhold its more of what the fuck was that kind of thing for me luke is a beautiful man
MMA,not_removed,weidman koed silva in silvas game and loved it thats why he wanted to kill rockhold in kicking game but that was stupid
MMA,not_removed,your comment suggests you acknowledge that kick lost him the fight
MMA,not_removed,switch those names around and i think your statement makes more sense
MMA,not_removed,not really vitor is the og money fighter ufc not paying enough off to pride ufc looking like the better prospect again back there i go lost to randy and tito let me make a pitstop in pride before a detour to strikeforce and cage rage then a return trip to pride before pissing hot and running off to england whats that affliction is paying stupid money back to the states i go affliction folds and pride closes shop hey ufc whats up want to give me title shots in a year stretch this last ufc run is the longest belfort has gone with a single promotion in his entire career dude is one of the best at getting every single penny he can belfort the contract negotiator is probably more accomplished than belfort the fighter
MMA,not_removed,thats a fair statement then
MMA,not_removed,hahaluke is a beautiful man you cant deny it another guy who just hit the genetics lottery ive thought the same thing about timberlake and tom brady and rob lowe and jack black
MMA,not_removed,one of these things is not like the others
MMA,not_removed,while lw and ww are good ive been really into bw lately cody tj cruz caraway aljo lineker dodson almeida rivera any of them could be matched up with anyone and itd be a great fight plus you have the potential for flw guys to move up like elliot smolka dj
MMA,not_removed,im thinking for men its got to be lw and for women i love the sw division
MMA,not_removed,middleweight from jacare to rockhold to weidman to romero its lowkey stacked at the top with no one fighter ruling with an iron fist but a bunch who very well could given the proper circumstances
MMA,not_removed,welterweight or lightweight on whatever night it happens to be love me some heavyweights sprinkled in too
MMA,not_removed,hard to say for quality of fights lightweight through middleweight are great good size ko chance yet still have stamina for slugging obviously heavyweight for technical ability fw and bw are crazy fun and fast if i had to pick one id say welterweight is just the perfect combination of power and speed weve seen some crazy brawls at for sure
MMA,not_removed,historically welterweight has had the best series of fights
MMA,not_removed,seeing lhw at the bottom just reminded me of how shallow and empty that division is anymore
MMA,not_removed,its gotta be lightweight good middle ground for the speed vs power argument brutal top talent has the fight in mma happening soon with khabib vs tony next to codytj and its its champ is the biggest name in the sport edit grammar is important
MMA,not_removed,jeez shows why horiguchi left and why the flyweights always get shafted on where they get placed on the card
MMA,not_removed,im the most excited about featherweight atm lots of rising prospects choi rodriguez ortega gavin tucker exciting vets cub zombie edgar and some of the top poundforpound fighters in the world aldo holloway mcgregor theres a lot of different styles of fighters and its the only division where i feel everyone in the top has a chance to be relevant in the title picture
MMA,not_removed,mcgregorweight
MMA,not_removed,heavyweight for me biggest and baddest trying to knock each others block off
MMA,not_removed,i feel like fw would be most voted if conor still fought that weight and if he fought then ww would be most voted
MMA,not_removed,middleweight best bodies
MMA,not_removed,im very interested to see the results of this in a couple hours personally ive always thought the only reason wmma divisions are in such focus right now compared to other divisions like heavyweight or featherweight is because its pushed so hard by the ufc and the media itll be very nice to see if my thinking is bullshit or if wmma divisions start topping the others
MMA,not_removed,sad times for ufcs marquee division
MMA,not_removed,damn light heavyweight at the bottom they mightve been the most exciting years ago
MMA,not_removed,i love to watch the heavyweights
MMA,not_removed,thank you to everyone who voted and provided your feedback in the comments really interesting results to say the least let me know if you all are interested in more polls similar to this one
MMA,not_removed,gotta be womens featherweight
MMA,not_removed,lightweight in the ufc is a great mix of technique and power
MMA,not_removed,at any given moment opinions can change based on the talent in said division id have to say lightweight and welterweight are really exciting at the moment heavyweight will always be a roller coaster theyre so big one punch changes a fight
MMA,not_removed,which is more competitive ww or lw
MMA,not_removed,featherweight for me my favorite fighters are cub swanson and korean zombie hollawayalso is going to be a great fight and young exciting guys like korean superboy and yair
MMA,not_removed,anything lw and down i like watching guys who dont gas out and move fast as hell
MMA,not_removed,im actually surprised it wasnt middleweight that won this little poll
MMA,not_removed,how is womens featherweight not the lowest
MMA,not_removed,welterweight
MMA,not_removed,ufc bra
MMA,not_removed,ww has the best combination of power speed and athleticism in my opinion also i cant remember a division that has had more exciting title fights consecutively than ww in the last few years
MMA,not_removed,middleweight romero bisping jacare silva rockhold weidman mousasi brunson hall whittaker
MMA,not_removed,lol at the votes for womens featherweight why did they have to go and ruin the integrity of the poll like that
MMA,not_removed,bw also has some great talent coming into it from other orgs like duquesnoy and probably moraes who will be up there with the names you mention
MMA,not_removed,the top of cruzgarbrandtdillashaw makes bw pretty stacked
MMA,not_removed,the movement of the guys at bantam weight is what makes it for me so fast and flowy its beautiful to watch especially the top three
MMA,not_removed,bw is stacked im looking forward to seeing what firekid can do in there
MMA,not_removed,agreed bro stacked division with young talent for years to come every bantamweight fight ends up being a fun fight somehow
MMA,not_removed,interestingly the average male height corresponds really well for a weighin weight of to so it makes sense that theres such a large concentration of talent at lw and ww
MMA,not_removed,agreed id say i get most excited for the top middleweight fights even though its not as stacked as some other divisions
MMA,not_removed,i feel that through the years they have also consistently been one of the deepest division i think that the argument can be made that at any point in the last years they are been either or talent wise this is probably why we get so many good fights out of the division
MMA,not_removed,thats a weird way to spell heavyweight
MMA,not_removed,lhw was incredible about years ago
MMA,not_removed,championship level top then it goes down from there it was like that for awhile with mw but mw seems to be shaping up well now
MMA,not_removed,its champ not it is champ
MMA,not_removed,to be fair its a super uncompetitive division with no captivating personalities i love mm dont get me wrong its just not a very interesting division this is asking for favorites and i dont even see how anyone can claim its their favorite
MMA,not_removed,i actually agree plus a large portion of them are out of shape so it makes me feel a bit better when i munch on my cheetos although overeemjds made me feel like a slob
MMA,not_removed,seriously heavyweight rarely moves in any reasonable direction its hard to be invested in such a volatile division
MMA,not_removed,they snails tho
MMA,not_removed,yoel and rockhold skewing those averages big time
MMA,not_removed,i mean this sub is niche in general
MMA,not_removed,no doubt years ago you had guys like chuck liddell randy couture tito forrest rampage rashad machida and shogun all kicking around the top
MMA,not_removed,add in the fact that lightweight the division right below is at least the most stacked division imo ww is the only other contender for and it continues to beg the suggestion maybe both divisions talent pools are so deep that its a good idea to throw away and make and
MMA,not_removed,why our your acting two hostile too him friend
MMA,not_removed,wot
MMA,not_removed,im kinda skeptical of the lack of personality at flw even if we have a mcgregor personality at flw if all people just say midget fight it doesnt matter how charismatic a flw fighter is people dont want to watch flw dj said on jre that people like watching bigger people fight i think its just as simple as that
MMA,not_removed,its plenty competitive just not at the belt the ufc has done an absolutely shit job of promoting flw theyre perpetually on undercards
MMA,not_removed,i wish i was as in shape as those out of shape guys are
MMA,not_removed,its kinda cool being the same height and weight as cain
MMA,not_removed,jacare looks like a beast too though
MMA,not_removed,very true this is probably the best estimate i could get however its not gospel but it could tell me if my line of thinking is just garbage or may have some merit
MMA,not_removed,and anderson silva dipping in and out for fun fights here and there too
MMA,not_removed,hendo vitor
MMA,not_removed,honestly i think its about time to make that change to and if you look at the top guys at welterweight woolley wonderboy lawler maia and multiple other guys in the division theyre either former middleweights or closer to middleweight than lightweight its a really big step up in size for guys like rda and cerrone who are just a bit too big for lightweight and like you said the depth is obviously there
MMA,not_removed,fiend
MMA,not_removed,apostrophe
MMA,not_removed,i mean you can call bantamweight a midget division too but it is a more interesting division
MMA,not_removed,why do you think that is because flyweight fights rarely deliver unless mighty mouse is fighting the only flyweight fight i remember from is cejudo v benavidez they could pour money into promoting that division and still no one would give a fuck about it apart from the hardcores
MMA,not_removed,lbs of dorito dust and baja blast
MMA,not_removed,and bispings body isnt too bad either
MMA,not_removed,yeah if they can make a womens fw division and give out belts left and right they can also do this
MMA,not_removed,most of the top bantamweights are big for the weight class while flyweight is full of guys small and big for the weight class because the smaller guys have no other weight to cut to
MMA,not_removed,benavidez delivers on a regular basis
MMA,not_removed,agreed and if they were gonna make any womens division it should have been flyweight
MMA,not_removed,interesting that the main benavidez fights people remember are him getting larruped against dj ii and him nicking a sketchy decision against cejudo i hope for his sake he can get that defining win to put an exclamation mark on his career
MMA,not_removed,if rampage vs ishii got viewers what will this get
MMA,not_removed,theyre not headlining
MMA,not_removed,bellator is not deep enough to run event per month i hate the name bellator so much i hope coker can make his own promotionname its been years i was hoping wed see more changes but this isnt what a coker mma promotion looks like and i dont think its cokers fault the ring the grey the broey dudebro spike tv style of promoting scott coker is an aestheticnuanced mma promoter i need that showtime production back rizin has only done shows and its already my mma promotion in terms of i want to watch that hopefully coker is at least making some good money thatll let him start up a promotion again if he wants grassroots style cung le rockhold cormier ronda miesha carano cyborg nick diaz melendez woodley etc etc etc
MMA,not_removed,ben saunders seems like a bit of a retard
MMA,not_removed,who would of thought that the person to get floyd to come out of retirement is from an entirely different sport
MMA,not_removed,i appreciate the effort from stephens but he is on the outside looking in when it comes to being a potential opponent for conor
MMA,not_removed,the humble guy taking a stand against the bully gimmick would work way better if stephens didnt say shit like mcclown fire crotch leprechaun etc like you have to have some sense of selfawareness if youre going to approach this like youre some sort of hero
MMA,not_removed,fictional so who the fuck is conor mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,dude stop conor has nothing to gain from engaging you any further and that fook is this guy dismissal is as much as youre going to get you lost this one stop trying to win move on know when to fold
MMA,not_removed,i reckon stephens kos conor stiff if they ever fight we all know conors weaknesses are against strikers wrestlers submission guys professional wrestlers hairdressers boxers and so on so forth hes lucky hes been fed nothing but limbless amateurs off the street to win his featherweight belt such a boring fighter too people only like him because hes the only fighter who can talk english hes gonna get found out in his next out or if not definitely the one after
MMA,not_removed,yeah conors a bully but this guys
MMA,not_removed,who the fook is this guy
MMA,not_removed,we know hes a character the thing is we like it
MMA,not_removed,hes still salty
MMA,not_removed,man mcgregor has a knack at turning professional fighters into frustrated children
MMA,not_removed,in his last going to have to try much harder than that
MMA,not_removed,maybe he should stop talking now
MMA,not_removed,why is he still talking
MMA,not_removed,if only stephens could integrate his insults into his game better i feel integration is key if hes to get a shot at mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,lol maybe focus on your opponent and not someone else its funny to see how connors who the fook is that comment got to him i really hope frankie hurts this dude
MMA,not_removed,a bully yet you are the one going down a weight class to fight smaller guys while he goes up in weight to challenge himself k
MMA,not_removed,hahahahaha
MMA,not_removed,i appreciate him tryna get that fight but stephens would get slept if he fought conor
MMA,not_removed,no man bullies pick fights with people weaker than them
MMA,not_removed,remember that time stephens and a friend allegedly beat a man so bad he stopped breathing
MMA,not_removed,the guy who calls mcgregor a ginger crackhead and a leprechaun call mcgregor a bully its funny that calling someone a cholo is racist but calling someone a ginger crackhead leprechaun isnt
MMA,not_removed,who the fuck is this guy
MMA,not_removed,squeaky wheel gets the grease
MMA,not_removed,not a stephens hater as a matter of fact i thoroughly enjoy watching his fights but on top of the name calling at the press conference he has landed bombs on guys after they have been kod stiff that make the hendo flying forearm to bisping look polite
MMA,not_removed,ufc mcgregor might be a fictional character but real life mcgregor gets to spend all his cash and right now hes got the whole playgrounds lunch money
MMA,not_removed,this is what happens when we as fans keep posting about how fighters need to make their own opportunity stephens was actually good on rogan although somewhat delusional about the extent of his ability but hes probably now more famous for getting mugged off then hed ever be from actual fights fair play he might get pettis off the back of this even if frankie ragdolls him
MMA,not_removed,mcg is such a good trash talker these dudes need to take improv classes to even attempt to verbally defend themselves
MMA,not_removed,no shit its just a character why would anyone care
MMA,not_removed,fictional character real money
MMA,not_removed,i got fucked dry with down votes for making this comparison yesterday im glad at least stephens agrees with me even if were the only two guys and he has a little bit of incentive to feel that way
MMA,not_removed,bruce buffer at ufc introducing his opponent fighting out of the red corner a mixed martial artist holding a record of wins and losses standing feet inches tall weighting in at pounds fighting out of san diego california by way of des moines iowa jeremy who the fuck is this guy stephens
MMA,not_removed,possibly not for long though if he wins his next fights in devastating fashion starting with frankie
MMA,not_removed,ginger crackhead
MMA,not_removed,also things like im gonna knock your boy the fuck out
MMA,not_removed,i saw that exchange as a tough guy bully talking shit to someone smarter and more successful than him being shut down and now being extremely butt hurt yeah i looked for him out back and he didnt want any part of me you mean he just ignored you since you arent even on his radar dont get me wrong i like stephens but he should have just stayed out of it gotta give it to him though he saw an opportunity and took it
MMA,not_removed,only one thing left to do full heel turn
MMA,not_removed,to be fair he didnt say he was humble he said he likes to humble bullies he said that sometimes you have to fight fire with fire with bullies
MMA,not_removed,would also work better if this wasnt a thing
MMA,not_removed,the donald trump of mma gets the job done talks a lot of shit annoying to most people
MMA,not_removed,its crazy how much these limbless fighters outweighed him tho
MMA,not_removed,finally someone who gets it
MMA,not_removed,never understood why this isnt brought up more always thought he was a nob ever since that incident
MMA,not_removed,jesus christ what a scumbag
MMA,not_removed,killer instinct indeed
MMA,not_removed,speak for yourself he definitely appeals to a certain kind of person but not everyone
MMA,not_removed,as a child all i could ever dream about was my first red panty night little did i know it was much messier and not as fun as mcgregor made it out to be blood everywhere
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor acts like a child himself thou
MMA,not_removed,umm mcgregor is the one coming down from welterweight to take on the lightweight champion as the law of mcgregor states in accordance with nate v mac once you fight at a heavier weight you will always be referred to as a fighter from highest weight class you fought at thats why bj penn is considered one of the goat heavyweights of all time
MMA,not_removed,tbf mcgregor is still bigger than eddie and is larger than most of his fw opponents
MMA,not_removed,conors whole ufc career is based on being so much bigger than his opponents
MMA,not_removed,i dont think so id love to see that fight
MMA,not_removed,or replaced with a new one
MMA,not_removed,or that time he was
MMA,not_removed,i agree he has a huge opportunity here with edgar in msg
MMA,not_removed,has frankie ever been koed
MMA,not_removed,i do like that one
MMA,not_removed,just curious is conor the type of person you would regard as ginger in america his hair looks brown to me s
MMA,not_removed,its weird i could have sworn that he didnt sound like this much of a tool when he was on rogans podcast
MMA,not_removed,was that last line sarcastic or did you just contradict yourself every other sentence
MMA,not_removed,gets the job done lmao
MMA,not_removed,yeah he definitely exhibits childish behaviour from time to time but hes able to keep his wits about him and use insults quite a bit sharper than mcclown unlike mcclown i have a list of ufcs best highlights beat more than one former champ and never backed down to adversity i come from the blue collar work ethic dedicated and hungrier than ever this nonsense is about a stinging as calling mcgregor a leprechaun the reason mcgregor and cruz have such good tear downs of their opponents games are because their critics are rooted in reality stephens is no where near that and it sounds like he picked up his name calling zingers for a playground
MMA,not_removed,thou shall not speak as such against lord mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,are you new here conor is not a welterweight
MMA,not_removed,taller definitely not bigger than eddie
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor walks around at or like alvarez claims he does
MMA,not_removed,you say that as if there wasnt a point in cage warriors where he was champ at pounds you say that as if he didnt fight max and nate diaz you say that as if eddie alvarez isnt walking around at
MMA,not_removed,bye ronda d
MMA,not_removed,no but hes been stunned many times during his fights with gray benson also rocked him bad with an upkick biggest heart in the game though and ill always be a fan of the answer
MMA,not_removed,hes a day walker
MMA,not_removed,indeed but i guess when it comes to insult mc gregor anything goes
MMA,not_removed,brown is your hair literally on fire
MMA,not_removed,stephens is awesome he was just trying too hard to be a tool to get recognition at the press conference he succeeded
MMA,not_removed,nope i just straight up contradicted myself i dont know when to shut up sometimes
MMA,not_removed,i hate trump but he has managed to stay off the streets so he has fooled and fucked enough people to stay afloat but it seems that for most ppl here that was whooooosh
MMA,not_removed,blue collar connor was an apprentice plumber before he started fighting but he should use that insult nate seemed to have gotten under connors skin when he referred to connor as some rich yuppie trying to play at being a fighter
MMA,not_removed,beat more than one former champ but have you knocked dead one of the current champstop fighters in the world
MMA,not_removed,the reason mcgregor and cruz have such good tear downs of their opponents games are because their critics are rooted in reality ill cut your head off and parade around your town can you give me one example of conor actually doing a realistic tear down of his opponents game the closest ive seen is youve got no power i will ko you stiff within a round
MMA,not_removed,hes clearly joking
MMA,not_removed,and nate is
MMA,not_removed,can you read i said his ufc career is based on being bigger than his opponents
MMA,not_removed,i have dark brown hair although mcgregor doesnt have the darkest of skin tones or hair he definitely isnt regarded as ginger lmao
MMA,not_removed,the exception of course being brendan schaub
MMA,not_removed,i used to really like rogan but manhes kind of annoying
MMA,not_removed,connor was an apprentice plumber before he started fighting but iirc he comes from a fairly well off family
MMA,not_removed,matt serra kod the goat does that make him better than mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,lol if you have trouble distinguishing between when mcgregor is saying ridiculous nonfight specific shit to hype a fight and giving his opinion on how a fight plays out thats on you and if you can tell the difference youre entering this conversation from a dishonest platform and i dont want to waste more time with someone like that
MMA,not_removed,nicks little brother
MMA,not_removed,can you read i said max and nate
MMA,not_removed,blonde hair is also a thing guys
MMA,not_removed,nah rogans cool
MMA,not_removed,very much so he lived comfortably while training full time not many others get to just quit everything and pursue their dream and be fortunate enough to not have to worry about money he comes from a well off family and a decent area make no mistake about it he didnt struggle at all growing up compared to a diaz brother nor did he grow up fighting and playing football because they were the only things to do in ireland growing up
MMA,not_removed,no beating mcgee makes him better than mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,i think that someone shitting on stephens for calling mcgregor a leprechaun is kind of silly considering that most of mcgregors shit talking is at that level
MMA,not_removed,max is not bigger than conor nate is conors most recent fight i didnt say that conor has never fought anyone bigger than him in the ufc i said that his career in the ufc is based on being bigger if he started his ufc career with going with getting finished by nate diaz he wouldnt have the same ufc career that he does now would he
MMA,not_removed,mcgregor definitely not blonde cmon bruh d
MMA,not_removed,really high level hes a world tool time champion when youre in there with him you see there are levels to this shit you cant just think youre gonna hang with him because youre reasonably talkative and a bit of a douchebag
MMA,not_removed,shhhhh rogan is an asshole afternoon reddit has decided
MMA,not_removed,crumlin is a well off area now is it get real ð
MMA,not_removed,some of it is yes but i dont think its even close to most of it and consistency matters pretty much every insult stephens has launched has been on a grade level if chris rock was up on stage and called mcgregor a leprechaun i wouldnt be shitting on his humour level id probably even laugh
MMA,not_removed,who is that with conor edit i was being serious who in the blue fuck is that
MMA,not_removed,probably just a fan who caught him at just the right moment
MMA,not_removed,uh who cares whats that in his hand a joint
MMA,not_removed,with all his legal and mental issues i sometimes forget how talented a fighter he was as well as his ability yo create opportunities for himself outside of fighting
MMA,not_removed,he did this seminar at my old gym in mississauga shoutout to kombat arts lol i literally just started taking mma classes at the time and i remember going in that saturday morning for a conditioning class this dude with a red streak in his hair walked into the grappling area and a bunch of people followed behind i remember my friends and i wondering who tf he was back then a few months following we flipped our shit at the nearmiss of an encounter
MMA,not_removed,what makes this canadian
MMA,not_removed,canadian neck tie
MMA,not_removed,it really is a shame he couldnt manage his mental health better or didnt have anyone in his life to guide him a little more really talented and charismatic guy
MMA,not_removed,he actually seemed like a balanced mans man type of dude but next thing you know hes acting up on mma hour and the swat team is front of his house wtf
MMA,not_removed,after they fall asleep you have to softly whisper soory into their ear
MMA,not_removed,losing to cb and getting cut was the beginning of it all
MMA,not_removed,bully beatdown money made him insane
MMA,not_removed,ebaumsworld didnt expect that today
MMA,not_removed,i still feel bad for him but holy shit andy wang was an idiot though he has contributed one of the funniest mma memes ever with his classic stand and wang so yes the dude is a legend and definitely a warrior
MMA,not_removed,waaaaaaaaahhhhhhh waaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
MMA,not_removed,no and no
MMA,not_removed,no their contracts ironclad
MMA,not_removed,this was already posted hours ago
MMA,not_removed,did you even look through the front page before submitting
MMA,not_removed,you do realise anyone can put anything there
MMA,not_removed,try burkman yes like josh httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermburkman
MMA,not_removed,i didnt until i saw a thousand versions of this lol httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermchloe
MMA,not_removed,im not a fighter by any means that being said since most major promotions are banning the practice it probably wouldnt be a good habit to start
MMA,not_removed,do not do it this certainly played a role in my loss to lesnar the use of ivs can stabilze you if dehydrated that does not mean damage was not already done i cut so much water in that fight that in round one i stopped sweating i was bone dry whatever we did the day before wasnt helping now put in other terms i was hiking in the dessert and got lost guy gave me some water and i drak them and decided to keep hiking once you depleted your system it is ready to deplete again my weight cut brought on lactic acidosis and that started shutting down my organs in between rounds you can hear me telling my corner i cant go on they did not understand because i was dominating we used a rn we used bags the cost was everything i worked towards
MMA,not_removed,what is better word out there is that fighters rehydrate through their assholes as an alternative and it works
MMA,not_removed,if they are fighting outside of the ufc they may well and often do use an iv to recover from a weight cut it is well worth it i have heard of some guys just having someone do it in their hotel room if you are in the ufc usada will test for the plastic and it is banned because it is indicative of possible blood doping and can be a masking agent
MMA,not_removed,no they used to up until recently but now its illegal per usada guidelines
MMA,not_removed,used to be allowed but is now banned
MMA,not_removed,who has banned it other than the ufc
MMA,not_removed,what is your plan for future fights then come in lighter to begin with to avoid a massive cut
MMA,not_removed,idk if fighters actually do this but it definitely can work same as with people that iv drugs they can put it up their ass and it is just as effective
MMA,not_removed,female fighters actually soak tampons in pedialyte gatorade and smartwater then shove as many up there as possible scientists have determined this will make them rehydrate faster in fact cris cyborg used tampons that had been injected with potassium and electrolytes then soaked in pedialyte for hours and finally dusted in gatorade powder before george lockhart inserted tampons at a time inside of her how do you think she gained lbs in hours
MMA,not_removed,i forgot ufc mma
MMA,not_removed,in the ufc because of usada its allowed everywhere else
MMA,not_removed,one fc eliminated weight cutting by dehydration the overall attitude is changing toward weight cutting
MMA,not_removed,usada bans it
MMA,not_removed,one championship basically banned weight cutting
MMA,not_removed,it should be banned everywhere ncaa addressed this years ago same day weigh ins etc
MMA,not_removed,i want to come into fight week at about i am plus a bag a totinos pizza rolls right now
MMA,not_removed,heading to the bathroom to try this now
MMA,not_removed,if it makes you feel better to point that out so be it i was just trying to answe the guys question
MMA,not_removed,i gotcha thought it was an athletic commission thing
MMA,not_removed,does one fc allow them dont they have same day weigh ins now
MMA,not_removed,i think you mean wada
MMA,not_removed,other than the ufc
MMA,not_removed,right but thats different from banning iv use that just means they have no use for ivs the op said that most major promotions are banning it which isnt really accurate to my knowledge edit why am i getting downvoted for correcting misleading information
MMA,not_removed,i agree but im just talking about things as they are not sure why im getting downvoted for trying to correct misleading information
MMA,not_removed,we look forward to it good luck
MMA,not_removed,if you wanna have some real fun this weekend try this you know how when you go to a bar you wanna get drunk but drinks at the club and bar are so fucking expensive for a redheadedslut wtf economy so you and your crew drink before headed to the latest hot spot that charges a fee to just go inside and we all pay it willingly by the time the uber gets you to the club and you get in that buzz from the wild turkey you stole from your roommate is long gone well ladies its time to change that this weekend make sure to grab some cheap vodka and soak the super absorbent biggest heavy flow style tampons for a long time then right before heading out shove those bad boys up into your special purpose and let the devils juice do its thing be careful now because that vagina shot will creep up on you
MMA,not_removed,i dont know but you wouldnt need an iv with one fcs weigh in system its impossible to cut a large amount of weight under it
MMA,not_removed,pfft what does this goof know
MMA,not_removed,i know i was mostly saying that its indirectly like that
MMA,not_removed,youre right i misspoke you cant deny the attitude toward it is most definitely changing getting used to using it as a tool is not only dangerous it also sets one up for failure of in the future they fight for an organization that doesnt allow it
MMA,not_removed,ill give you an upvote sensitive sally
MMA,not_removed,listen here dana dont be mad i stole your ring girls
MMA,not_removed,i was never talking about the attitude changing all i was pointing out is that most major promotions are banning it just isnt true the only promotion that has effectively banned weight cutting is onefc and the only one thats banned ivs is the ufc
MMA,not_removed,thx bby
MMA,not_removed,notice i said youre right i misspoke
MMA,not_removed,i dont see whats awkward
MMA,not_removed,do you even know what awkward is lol
MMA,not_removed,wheres that mixtape at
MMA,not_removed,i really like conors shit talking and all but fuck the money shit just makes me cringe
MMA,not_removed,aldo predicting mcgregor diaz
MMA,not_removed,i was hoping so bad that conoraldo would become a huge rivalry with trilogy fighting and so on fucking had to go down in seconds now diaz became what i hoped aldoconor would smh
MMA,not_removed,shit was lit but apparently he got shot in the cock so no more flows any time soon
MMA,not_removed,hes in the worst paid sport and acts like a billionaire talking down to fighters who get paid less then him hes in nearly the smallest weight division and picks on guys like mendes for his height and the average sized then gets mad when people like nate diaz say he fights normal sized human beings compared to his competition i like mcgregor i appreciate his shtick for the most part but hes got some logistical flaws going on here edit to people downvoting hes been doing this since before the mendes fight hes well paid now but hes always walked around flaunting how highly paid he is when even at the mendes fight compared to other athletes he was making chump change
MMA,not_removed,too lit cant wait for season to drop
MMA,not_removed,he made at least million dollars this years salary alone thats elite for any sport
MMA,not_removed,hes going to own a castle before hes i dont think he gives a shit
MMA,not_removed,he was on the forbes list he has every right to act like a billionaire
MMA,not_removed,to give him some credit though hes from a place where having in your account is class
MMA,not_removed,i really never said he gives a shit i said he gives himself credit for shit by comparing himself to the lower end of the spectrum acts like a giant against acts like a rich boy compared to athletes making a year while he wasnt cracking a million its a part of his mantra and whatever its just not a very great part of it
MMA,not_removed,hes been doing this since well before the aldo fight which is where he got his first big payday disclosed and even before the mendes fight
MMA,not_removed,i would imagine most fighters are from a place where having grand in your bank account is pretty sweet heck arent most of us from that place
MMA,not_removed,they all started from somewhere and so did conor not like he was danas son or something that he got promoted
MMA,not_removed,what i love about conor is that hes not putting up a front hes not necessarily a good or a bad guy hes just doing what conor wants if he wants to say something ridiculous then hell say something ridiculous because it rattles people and gets their attention like you he also takes defeat better than some of these so called humble fighters fighting is not a long career hes trying to get his cheese and have it for later
MMA,not_removed,and he eventually made the vision that believed inspoke of a reality its very inspiring actually rather than upsetting
MMA,not_removed,hes a fighter though you can tell hes really able to hang with a great fighter like nate
MMA,not_removed,he didnt rattle me i literally just said its just a part of his shtick that isnt all that great
MMA,not_removed,it seems to be working for him
MMA,not_removed,shut up what are you doing youll ruin it
MMA,not_removed,please delete this because rmma will come after you
MMA,not_removed,can we sacrifice op to the mma gods to appease them for his transgression
MMA,not_removed,delet this
MMA,not_removed,we sacrificed an entire card for
MMA,not_removed,the fuck man the mma gods are listening
MMA,not_removed,tragedy is only an elevator away
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,stop provoking the mma gods heathen
MMA,not_removed,his shoulder popped out during his fight with dalby and he said something to the effect of it wasnt the first time itd happened so maybe he is taking time to deal with that he is really a bright prospect though if not for the shoulder injury i think hed have beaten dalby hope he gets back soon
MMA,not_removed,you can follow him on twitter here his shoulder was fucked so hes getting it fixed
MMA,not_removed,he looked brilliant in the first two rounds against dalby before he popped his shoulder looking forward to seeing his next fight hopefully hes not sidelined too long
MMA,not_removed,i think he was injured for a while
MMA,not_removed,wait is the character rule gone
MMA,not_removed,looks like it when i posted was playing on just writing diaz until i hit the limit in honour of the love the diaz bros get here
MMA,not_removed,swangin n bangin
MMA,not_removed,fighter or fan we all use the hand
MMA,not_removed,black beast social media champ
MMA,not_removed,stop posting for the love of god
MMA,not_removed,stop posting what
MMA,not_removed,the mods have deleted the same exact post maybe times in the past hour
MMA,not_removed,okay let them delete this one too
MMA,not_removed,stopped reading at barnett is certainly no slouch on the feet but he wont be throwing the variety of strikes that his counterpart will huh arlovski has punches plus a backfist thingy
MMA,not_removed,barnett round
MMA,not_removed,came in here to say the exact same thing
MMA,not_removed,that is literally the last place you want to get kicked and yoel doesnt just eat it he returns
MMA,not_removed,this should have killed yoel instead he does what he always does and nearly kills brunson in the third
MMA,not_removed,isnt this the kick that made yoel shit himself
MMA,not_removed,just rewatched this wow punishment the ref was channeling mazagati surely the er staff presumed him hit by a construction vehicle
MMA,not_removed,i dont understand how his head hit his peck that hard that it rippled like that like say if that was just the sheer force of the kick that it smashed his head that hard how could he have survived that
MMA,not_removed,you do that to me
MMA,not_removed,im not saying it was a gentle kick but it looks like it didnt land clean the lower part of his shin lands against romeros shoulder blades and thats where the strongest part of this kick would be im sure the kneeshin to the back of his head was still packing loads of power though
MMA,not_removed,lets wait and see how people say he cheated this fight
MMA,not_removed,ayyy hesus lmao
MMA,not_removed,with a flying knee launched from cuba
MMA,not_removed,seriously hits behind the ear are notorirous for zapping your equilibrium and yoel didnt even wobble much iirc
MMA,not_removed,isnt his neck fucked up pretty bad dude walks around like juggernaut from xmen
MMA,not_removed,nah hes at least a good from the metro pcs logo romero is safe in this gif
MMA,not_removed,that stoppage was offensively late
MMA,not_removed,the kick moved his whole body making the pec ripple it wasnt his head hitting his pec
MMA,not_removed,ai lo yu der bransn ai lo yu no for gay yeezuz
MMA,not_removed,he purposely pooped so that brunson would quit
MMA,not_removed,clearly yoel has some sort of invisible energy shield around his head that absorbs the kick
MMA,not_removed,can we not pretend like he isnt a cheater i mean i like yoel hes an interesting dude and a crazy fighter but to defend his integrity is just ridiculous peds stoolgate and now watergate how do people keep pretending that he never cheated
MMA,not_removed,his head was obviously greased
MMA,not_removed,he low blowed brunson
MMA,not_removed,lifelong peds abuser
MMA,not_removed,cuban missile
MMA,not_removed,thats because his brain is actually in his massive traps
MMA,not_removed,he had a piece of his spine fused in his neck area
MMA,not_removed,underrated comment
MMA,not_removed,link
MMA,not_removed,yes it was you can clearly see it its in slow motion the ripple is caused by the chin
MMA,not_removed,gay jesus is watching over him
MMA,not_removed,stoolgate wasnt cheating he had too much vaseline on his cut so big john made him clean it off bjm said there was no cheating in that situation and bloody elbow did some research on stool gate first time between rounds is inconsistent and it was only seconds longer than the round before
MMA,not_removed,must be the reason why tim ken hates him
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,nope it starts before the chin hits
MMA,not_removed,extra seconds to recover from getting rocked is quite a bit
MMA,not_removed,oh come on this argument again big john was screaming at him to get off the stool yes big john delayed it further to wipe the grease off but before all that he was herding his corner out of the cage the dude is a cheater bro idk why you guys keep defending him i love him hes hilarious and a crazy entertaining fighter but hes a cheater
MMA,not_removed,videos private
MMA,not_removed,the ripple doesnt start his pec moves but does not ripple are you really that blind
MMA,not_removed,rocked from an illegal glove grab
MMA,not_removed,yes it does it moves up and then the ripple bounces down
MMA,not_removed,he must have grabbed his glove really hard s
MMA,not_removed,the ripple clearly bounces down due to his chin slamming against his chest
MMA,not_removed,so otherwise his pec was just going to stay raised up above its normal resting position forever
MMA,not_removed,i remember that bout being pretty competitive up until zingano unleashed the beast all over tates face but i understand what shes saying you beat someone and then they become champion no matter what winslosses youve accrued in that time i can still see that being a weird feeling
MMA,not_removed,zingano could have been champion too if she didnt think a flying knee would he an exciting way to start a fight with the best grapplerfinisher in her division
MMA,not_removed,she also had her moment to win that belt and came out with the singular worst game plan in ufc championship history you come at the king you best not miss
MMA,not_removed,matt hamill its weird for me to see jon jones as ufc champion
MMA,not_removed,tate was winning then cat went full round robbie lawler on miesha
MMA,not_removed,holm and ziagano are the two most likeable female fighters imo
MMA,not_removed,i call her kitty zing as a nickname
MMA,not_removed,its weird that zingano still hasnt fought since she lost to rousey
MMA,not_removed,i hope she destroys juliana
MMA,not_removed,lolshould the division stagnate and come to a complete stop because you chose to not fight for months its not weird its a fighter continuing to take fights and working their way up and got a title shot and capitalized
MMA,not_removed,with that mentality it would be weird for rousey if zingano became a champ as well
MMA,not_removed,not as weird as sprinting across the cage jumping into rhonda and then extending her arm meisha made the most of her opportunity
MMA,not_removed,cat is real miesha is fakethis is a fact of life cat is a true sweetheart miesha changed her name to cupcake to seem sweet but she aint holly holm and cat zigano are like the true good people in the womens fighting divisions theyd both help anybody with anythingi know this because i know everything obv
MMA,not_removed,struve beat the shit out of miocic thats the weirdest one by far for me
MMA,not_removed,more like tate giving an ass whooping for rounds before taking one when it ended
MMA,not_removed,both fighters had their moments in their first rounds but miesha was ahead during the rounds
MMA,not_removed,hopping knee
MMA,not_removed,could have thats a bit generous one could say that all the flying knee did was speed up the inevitable
MMA,not_removed,i dont see how her boxing isnt any better than rondas and she doesnt have good footwork its not like she would have been able to play a distance game against rousey her entire game is sloppily striking into the clinch going to work with kneeselbows and looking for a takedown shes like a worse version of rousey
MMA,not_removed,itd be weirder if he heard it
MMA,not_removed,michelle waterson
MMA,not_removed,because theyre actually legit good people not like the other chicks pretending to be
MMA,not_removed,catnis everzing
MMA,not_removed,well with the interrogation afterwards who could blame her for taking a healthy chunk of time off
MMA,not_removed,you mean the same way ronda feels about about tate
MMA,not_removed,against ronda
MMA,not_removed,i gotta upvote just for that hilarious last sentence lol
MMA,not_removed,or rda and jeremy stephens
MMA,not_removed,miesha got pummeled for the last minute and a half in the round against zingano after running out of stamina looking for submission attempts
MMA,not_removed,wasnt much of an ass whooping really its like all the conor fans saying well he won the first round in the diaz fight doesnt count for much when you get wrecked
MMA,not_removed,it was a bullshit stoppage
MMA,not_removed,i mean isnt that what competitive means meisha probably won the judges over in those two rounds on at least judges cards but ya that doesnt change the fact that the was the end of the fight because zingano decided it would end in her favor
MMA,not_removed,holm holm beat miesha for pretty much that whole fight until miesha got the takedown
MMA,not_removed,tippytoes knee
MMA,not_removed,i think my point was lost on you her terrible game plan assured her a loss more than a skill difference ever could
MMA,not_removed,rousey is unapologetic in being a bitch tate pretends not to be
MMA,not_removed,lets not ignore that she lost her husband and her biggest fight so far in the same period
MMA,not_removed,and holly considering she was getting the best of her
MMA,not_removed,pretty much if u slown down one bit vs cat your screwed it happened in the meisha and nunes fight if pena slows down just a bit cat will very likely take over her pacecardio might be her best weapon cat is a bad style match up for meisha especially after cat has added more muscle since their first fight
MMA,not_removed,it counts exactly for winning one round what is your point
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,so taking a round on all three cards is beating meisha
MMA,not_removed,holm stalked her cautiously and tate was patient yes holm was winning the exchanges they had but you can hardly say that tate was in any trouble holm had next to nothing on the ground
MMA,not_removed,it was a draw on the judges cards going into round five if miesha didnt try and submit holm and just held her for the rest of the round she wouldve won on points
MMA,not_removed,letsgotothemall knee
MMA,not_removed,your point wasnt lost on me my point was that it didnt really matter what she did as she had no reliable way of winning that fight
MMA,not_removed,fuck you man
MMA,not_removed,that was before her comeback fight vs nunes
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,lol what
MMA,not_removed,well like the holm vs tate fight they dont call holm the champion just because she dominated right up until the submission at the end hes just pointing out that rounds dont matter if the other person gets their hand raised
MMA,not_removed,and winning round and getting stopped counts for what nothing you got stopped
MMA,not_removed,yea it was a bullshit stoppage thats what i just said she wasnt out she was fine
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say bullshit but should have let it run a bit longer
MMA,not_removed,exactly even if miesha hadnt got the finish she very may have won the fight just on the td
MMA,not_removed,alistair overkneem
MMA,not_removed,it is lost on you im not saying what her actual chances of winning are lets put them at anyone has a chance of beating anyone she took an action that dropped even her chance to so my point is her gameplan is terrible you are arguing whether or not she could actually win
MMA,not_removed,yeah but you arent getting over ones death in two years you know
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,lol what
MMA,not_removed,it does matter because there is a big difference in getting clowned on as vs griffin style or jbj vs shogun style and in being competitive till the very end like holm vs tate it demonstrates that a rematch would be a very interesting fight
MMA,not_removed,what holm was barely edging tate out i had tate ahead going into the
MMA,not_removed,it counts for winning round i pose the question to you now what is your point
MMA,not_removed,she was not defending herself she ate hard knees to the face and collapsed not a bullshit stoppage at all any other damage was going to be unneeded
MMA,not_removed,i hear you
MMA,not_removed,that was her only gameplan striking into the clinch is the only thing she does well on the feet she did that and didnt even put herself in too bad of a position and she started working for a takedown but obviously ronda is better in the clinch and reversed it there was no other gameplan at some point she was going to sloppily strike into the clinch because thats how she wins fights she doesnt have the skillset to make a range striking game work and she cant shoot effectively as low percentage as it was that was her best chance to win
MMA,not_removed,if you had that fight as anything other than for holm your opinion as an mma spectator is meaningless one submission attempt early on and a thousand failed take downs doesnt win rounds holly wasnt beating the shit out of tate or anything but she won each round convincingly before the submission
MMA,not_removed,i didnt know rounds won counted on a fighters record
MMA,not_removed,yes the thing i wasnt saying is correct you won this argument with someone who wasnt saying that good job
MMA,not_removed,the first was holms by a slim margin the was a for tate the could have gone either way i scored it for tate because i thought she was being more effective on the feet with her counter striking and was clearly holms i feel like most people forget what actually happened in that fight holm was edging tate out on the feet but she wasnt significantly outstriking her aside from the round holm landed more than tate in round but i thought the strikes tate landed were more significant
MMA,not_removed,if she tries to strike at distance with ronda or shoot on her her chances go from whatever they were before to less than that the flying knee wasnt a bad gameplan as anything aside from striking into the clinch would not have given her a better chance its not like the sloppiness of the flying knee mattered as she ended up in the clinch with an underhook and a strong position to attack a takedown but ronda is just better in the clinch
MMA,not_removed,lol still trying to argue with me about something im not saying ok have fun
MMA,not_removed,even georges stpierre missed his jab every once in a while
MMA,not_removed,obviously the loss didnt humble her at all
MMA,not_removed,the travis lutter of basketball even missed a shot from time to time
MMA,not_removed,even the roman empire fell
MMA,not_removed,i guess shes gonna have to get knocked out to really get humbled
MMA,not_removed,and some would say michael jordanesque in her shot missing is julianna pena joe
MMA,not_removed,all this time i thought jon jones or anderson silva was the michael jordan of mma but really it was julianna pena
MMA,not_removed,even john f kennedy got assassinated
MMA,not_removed,i think peÃ±a and her camp saw a smaller woman and thought they could just overpower her and grind her into the canvas they clearly had no idea they were running into one of the smartest and hardest working martial artists in the ufc ill bet peÃ±a still cant wrap her head around it which is why she still cant give shevchenko any credit
MMA,not_removed,please actually read her statement so so sorry about my loss you guys too hungry at this level of competition you cannot make the first mistake or you pay the price this is a big time learning experience for me time to move forward though i take one look in the past and then i turn around and keep it pushin toward the future michael jordan missed shots and even the best mma fighters have tasted defeat at some point in their career my character is not defined by my wins and losses nor are they contingent on the amount of love i receive from those who truly matter to me mass thank you to those who realize how much work goes into this process it takes a village to get to the big stage and i could not be more grateful for my team who continue to help me achieve my dreams on a daily basis you guys motivate and inspire me to continue to be great you guys are my mentors my heroes my main support and without you being there for me there would be no venezuelanvixen much respectlove and thankfulness to those who tuned in to the fight like the terminator says ill be back nevergiveup livelifetothefullest minorsetbackforamajorcomeback dontcountmeout ufc
MMA,not_removed,she may want to open up the dom cruz book on how to handle defeat
MMA,not_removed,there is nothing actually wrong with her statement pena island will open again one day
MMA,not_removed,shes not wrong but she aint no michael jordan
MMA,not_removed,she did not just compare herself to jordan
MMA,not_removed,you miss of the shots you dont take michael scott
MMA,not_removed,no excuses and shows no loss of confidence even after a striker outclassed her in her own specialty cant seem to hate on her here
MMA,not_removed,even mike tyson got knocked out by buster douglas
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,shut the fuck up pena dont even act like you are on the same plane as michael jordan more like kwame brown
MMA,not_removed,i am out of the loop why does everyone hate pena
MMA,not_removed,i feel like this girl never got humbled in her life
MMA,not_removed,michael jordan made the shots when they counted thats how he became a champion
MMA,not_removed,she got taken down multiple times by a muay thai practitioner oh boy
MMA,not_removed,good god she really thinks she is all that and a bag of diamond encrusted cheetos
MMA,not_removed,comparing herself to one of the greatest to ever play bball ok
MMA,not_removed,when rmma dislikes a borderline decent looking female fighter you know she must be reprehensible
MMA,not_removed,pena lost me at jordan i get where shes coming from but holy shit there is some serious delusion here
MMA,not_removed,i like her
MMA,not_removed,a lot of you are blinded by hate for her but if you actually use your brain and think about her statement it makes sense she isnt comparing herself to michael fucking jordan shes just saying that even the absolute very best make mistakes and fail just like everyone else if the most dominant athletes arent perfect then she wont be either
MMA,not_removed,lmao people gave a fuck about michael jordan
MMA,not_removed,shes so boring
MMA,not_removed,so did darko milicic im going to say shes probably closer to the latter
MMA,not_removed,yikes please rephrase to something like even rodman missed a rebound
MMA,not_removed,so humble in defeat
MMA,not_removed,lmfao you got rekt and did nothing good in the entire fight
MMA,not_removed,please disappear into nonexistence already
MMA,not_removed,michael jordan missed shots in basketball and now youre missing the title shot in mma
MMA,not_removed,except this aint basketball and one loss doesnt count as a few missed shots
MMA,not_removed,even michael jordan missed shots like master tav says nothing is impossible
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,is she equating one fight to one shot ludicrous ps didnt read the article
MMA,not_removed,til she was undefeated
MMA,not_removed,haha that bitch is too much
MMA,not_removed,actually in the correct context michael jordan never lost a finals he made all with finals mvp honours now i guess he did lose some playoffs early in his career
MMA,not_removed,pena really underestimated schevchenko in my eyes she saw the muay thai accolades and thought easy submission and she was right
MMA,not_removed,danced all over her
MMA,not_removed,jordan is she fucking serious holy shit
MMA,not_removed,those quotes are pretty embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,the michael jordan comparison just made me laugh out loud
MMA,not_removed,i hate pena but if you read the whole thing she isnt comparing herself to jordan shes making the point that even the greats made mistakes and werent flawless but kept going
MMA,not_removed,wbw is so shallow that she is only like wins away from a title shot especially if nunes retains
MMA,not_removed,eh she has a point if it was a different fighter im sure wed all be saying that we appreciate her fighting spirit its all the extra baggage that makes us including me hate her i saw some comment in one of the post fight thread that had like upvotes that was like honestly shes just not a good person made me lol
MMA,not_removed,its also not even a remotely accurate analogy yes mj missed shots but also made them when it counted and showed up in pivotal moments of his career in relation to pena it would be more like even micheal jordan came out in playoff games at the height of his career and put up and no he didnt he always rose to the occasion and pushed passed it until he couldnt anymore because hes body couldnt keep up to even mention yourself in the same breath as him is an insult to his legacy
MMA,not_removed,tell that to josh koscheck p
MMA,not_removed,i dont know her whatsoever all i can base her personality on is reading interviews and public decision making that said i think shes the least likeable person ive watched in the ufc she comes off as the epitome of entitled im open to someone changing my mind
MMA,not_removed,her coach before the fight was acting like altitude could not possibly be a factor in the fight because julianna trains hard and seemed like he thought there was no danger in this fight for pena for sure change camps if youre surrounded by people like that
MMA,not_removed,what did you want her to say she said what pretty much every fighter says after a loss i made a mistake and ill learn and come back stronger in the future
MMA,not_removed,it takes a village to get to the big stage and i could not be more grateful for my team who continue to help me achieve my dreams on a daily basis you guys motivate and inspire me to continue to be great you guys are my mentors my heroes my main support and without you being there for me there would be no venezuelanvixen much respectlove and thankfulness to those who tuned in to the fight like the terminator says ill be back
MMA,not_removed,even jesus died on the cross
MMA,not_removed,i thought it was a solid performance she managed to close the distance well and nullify shevchenkos striking she just got caught
MMA,not_removed,how could you know that at all
MMA,not_removed,dont think this is particularly arrogant just saying that even the greats fall short sometime and shes obviously aspiring to be on that level she also said she made a mistake that you cant afford at that level of competition that its a learning experience that shell come back stronger and gave massive thanks and credit to her team that supported her all in all seems a perfect way to handle what was almost certainly a very disappointing loss
MMA,not_removed,roman empire is still looking strong believe that
MMA,not_removed,because of snek
MMA,not_removed,even anderson silva got caught
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,this is how she always fights
MMA,not_removed,not to nitpick but its weird not to mention her opponent at all
MMA,not_removed,how can a minor setback lead to a major comeback
MMA,not_removed,but circlejerk she cant handle a lossthis subreddit
MMA,not_removed,eh idk cruz had some good comments during the post fight presser but he also said he only lost because he got caught and then he said the reason he was pressuring cody was to give the fans an exciting fight he said he could have pulled back and he would have been able to win he was of course full of shit and just making excuses for his loss which is funny because he would always rip urijah for making excuses
MMA,not_removed,pennsylpeÃ±a
MMA,not_removed,to be honest i feel like if anyone but pena posted this everyone would be fine with it its a well thought out well written post but because its pena people are saying shes not humble enough in defeat people handle losses differently
MMA,not_removed,im sure you can if you try hard enough pick holes in her grammar or something
MMA,not_removed,outclassed is not the right word she got careless and got caught in an armbar i dont think it means shevchenko is a better grappler i dont like pena but lets not count her out just now
MMA,not_removed,should put gretzkys face on her
MMA,not_removed,she says a lot of cunty shit and does a lot of cunty shit like kicking dudes in the junk when she has professional fighters in her backup squad
MMA,not_removed,everyone doesnt hate her i enjoy watching her fight she has said done some dumb abrasive stuff comes off as cocky disrespectful just my opinion much of it is overreaction for example she used a common example of failure not making one quit that gets turned into shes got a lot of nerve comparing herself to the great mj haha maybe they read a headline and rile each other up bandwagon behavior heres what she said in her statement today you can judge it for yourself so so sorry about my loss you guys too hungry at this level of competition you cannot make the first mistake or you pay the price this is a big time learning experience for me time to move forward though i take one look in the past and then i turn around and keep it pushin toward the future michael jordan missed shots and even the best mma fighters have tasted defeat at some point in their career my character is not defined by my wins and losses nor are they contingent on the amount of love i receive from those who truly matter to me mass thank you to those who realize how much work goes into this process it takes a village to get to the big stage and i could not be more grateful for my team who continue to help me achieve my dreams on a daily basis you guys motivate and inspire me to continue to be great you guys are my mentors my heroes my main support and without you being there for me there would be no venezuelanvixen much respectlove and thankfulness to those who tuned in to the fight like the terminator says ill be back nevergiveup livelifetothefullest minorsetbackforamajorcomeback dontcountmeout ufc
MMA,not_removed,you do know muay thai has takedowns and that bullet is a master of sport in judo
MMA,not_removed,that muay thai practitioner also has several submission victories in her mma career as well shes not a onedimensional fighter even though her specialty is striking
MMA,not_removed,hahaha just what i was about to say im like really michael jordan
MMA,not_removed,youre god damn right
MMA,not_removed,thats not delusion shes right even the greats have a bad night shes just trying to cope with loss of course you must be honest with yourself when you lose but part of that honestly is affirming that its not the end of the world
MMA,not_removed,same
MMA,not_removed,darkos a champion though pena still has a long way to go
MMA,not_removed,its the ufcs loss if she doesnt bounce back though shes the only true hell in the wbw division and its so much easier to sell heel bitch v lovely person in a war between good and evil than lovely person v lovely person with a sense of friendly competition theres even proof on reddit in the fact that antipena commentsposts got significantly higher upvotes than provalentinapronunes commentsposts
MMA,not_removed,the flair right above this comment kinda takes some sincerity away from it haha
MMA,not_removed,shes not even exciting to watch she just walled n stalled the whole time until shevchenko started timing take downs to penas super telegraphed knees
MMA,not_removed,i introduce by the way did you guys know he was in the military
MMA,not_removed,im a guy that doesnt dislike many people in mma i like conor mcgregor i like michael bisping i like rockhold romero jon jones khabib garbrandt etc pena is one of the few that i actually dislike from her running her mouth straight out of the ultimate fighter to her dumbasscrazy actions that got her in trouble with the law to her attitude in general not a big fan dont think i ever will be
MMA,not_removed,id say there was one who outunlikeabled her he was in the prelims of one of the earlier tuf seasons in his interview he said stuff like im like napoleon dawg im like hitler dawg as he was in the process of being beaten down he called for a time out in his exit interview he was all bravado saying of his opponent the sun shines on every dogs ass once in a while after him though yeah probably pena
MMA,not_removed,her personality and style link up perfectly shes the one fighter everyone tunes in to watch lose main reason its a shame she didnt beat shevchenko everyone on here would have cared far more about watching nunes beat penas ass than watching two genuinely nice people fight to see who is the best
MMA,not_removed,that dude looks like a fucking weirdo
MMA,not_removed,no way in hell did she get caught her ego let her get too comfortable in valentinos guard she got complacent shes onedimensional fighter in a womans division where its starting to become a multidimensional and very highlevel weight class along with wmma in general she is like ronda rousey only a wrestler she even has the attitude and entitlement that of course ronda probably deserves but that stupid clampet pena has done next to fuck all to deserve anything the only thing she deserves respect for are the surgeries she has gone through thats it
MMA,not_removed,just got caught id be willing to say that about someone who was clipped by a wild punch but not someone who was in their opponents guard for a couple minutes and got armbarred
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say she just got caught because shevchenko attempted an armbar a few seconds earlier i would say she underestimated shevchenkos ground game and showed poor fight iq
MMA,not_removed,the problem is she doesnt really have a good way to win fights bullying your way to a decision can only take you so far she looked like a standout on tuf to me but it doesnt seem like shes really getting much better
MMA,not_removed,youre a brave man for saying something positive about pena on rmma
MMA,not_removed,i agree i hate pena but i definitely think she could pull off a rematch valentina impressed me tho and im glad as fuck she won valentina vs nunes is way more interesting than nunes vs pena imo
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,beelee dat
MMA,not_removed,still makes me angry that hes the one who came in at in the royal rumble
MMA,not_removed,even fedor got clipped
MMA,not_removed,yeah pretty much just blamed the loss on her making mistakes opposed to her opponent having a better night
MMA,not_removed,same thing bugged me about conor not giving props to nate and blaming it on mismanaged energy or some bs like that
MMA,not_removed,coke doesnt mention pepsi
MMA,not_removed,chael is undefeated buddeh
MMA,not_removed,id say regardless of the semantics he took his loss better in a general sense even embracing codys skill and not comparing himself to mj missing shots though he has way more room to make such a statement than a fighter like pena he also didnt get finished like pena did
MMA,not_removed,one day well make it to the promised land
MMA,not_removed,terrible game planning honestly felt lazy had her winning dominantly though so fdik
MMA,not_removed,is she better than ronda in judo
MMA,not_removed,yeah would have been fireworks if she beat shevchenko ufc brass is probably sad but im not
MMA,not_removed,and it is not like she had a mm type clinch where she threw deadly knees they were very weak and did not connect half of the time i believe herb should have separated them or at least warned her to keep active it is like when people sit in guard and throw weak ass punches that obviously do not hurt the least bit just to avoid the ref standing them up
MMA,not_removed,her styles pretty exciting to me she clearly wasnt intent on fencefucking all rounds but because shes a bitch outside the octagon while dc or gsp isnt lets just selectively decide when to assume that they are not saying you specifically are one of them but considering this potential misdirection of criticism i find it plausible of her wins come by finish and i swear to god before she opened her mouth people there were more people hyped for her style than people shitting on it ahh there it is reddit downvoting with no backup whatsoever
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,wow that guys a huge douchebag
MMA,not_removed,yes also fighting is easy according to colton
MMA,not_removed,what happened its not available in my country
MMA,not_removed,was that sam alvey congratulating him
MMA,not_removed,lol that was the guy that junie browning beat up
MMA,not_removed,its a testament to how good she is at what she does that shes being mentioned above kosheck here
MMA,not_removed,his inability to answer questions about her training without edmondesque praising was what made me not want to root for peÃ±a
MMA,not_removed,she has been super complacent in her last three fights she gets position and doesnt do much with it she did hit zingano a little bit and get a nice choke attempt in but she just let herself get comfortable with position against eye and valentina she talks about being a finisher but there are long stretches of no urgency with her
MMA,not_removed,especially when its such a difficult move to pull off in high level mma when was the last time we saw an armbar from full guard between top contenders bendo vs pettis over years ago after pettis put his foot in bendos guts a dozen times
MMA,not_removed,the problem is she doesnt really have a good way to win fights ground and pound is a decent way to win fights if you can reliably get people to the floor and get top position this is hindsight bias
MMA,not_removed,its a far more interesting fight but dont tell me that you wouldnt tune in to watch pena get slaughtered
MMA,not_removed,i mean thats not wrong she just left her arm there
MMA,not_removed,conor did give props to nate watch from about seconds
MMA,not_removed,i think the worst one was in the gsp documentary where one of gsps coaches said that gsp beat himself in the first matt hughes fight matt just happened to be there
MMA,not_removed,what was all that cokepepsi challenge talk in the about then
MMA,not_removed,terrible game planning honestly what else should she have done try and kickbox pena doesnt have a plan b
MMA,not_removed,no shed get worked in a judo match against ronda but if ronda retires shes the most decorated judoka in the division
MMA,not_removed,no
MMA,not_removed,i feel like im the only one that watched shevchenkos fight against holly holm i had such high hopes but she didnt look close to finishing at any point if youre gonna fight boring you should at least have the heel attitude to make sense of it
MMA,not_removed,i am not a fan of pena but what on earth are you talking about herb should break up a fighter actively throwing knees the fact that you got up votes is a signal to the rest that they are blinded by hate or never even watched the fight to begin with pena threw strikes to shevs with accuracy it is not on the ref at all to judge what is an effective strike and what isnt if they were fake knees then shev wouldnt have taken so long to catch one
MMA,not_removed,i swear to god before she opened her mouth people there were more people hyped for her style than people shitting on it the ufc also didnt do her many favors in the marketing for this fight valentina is pulling her coach on a sleigh in siberia and eating lemon slices meanwhile julianna is tangoing with her boyfriend and having a good time but overall youre right her behavior has really overshadowed her skill in terms of public perception
MMA,not_removed,if your worldview wasnt soaked in sarcasm i bet youd enjoy everything about life more
MMA,not_removed,the classic faceplant rnc defense
MMA,not_removed,that is why hes currently the undefeated champion of every division
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,went for the glove touch ducked underneath and took his opponent down
MMA,not_removed,yeah shes up there with the likes of the iron sheikh and mr perfect
MMA,not_removed,koscheck has gotten the shit beaten out of him repeatedly which helps
MMA,not_removed,he had a serial killer vibe
MMA,not_removed,i completely agree she makes too many stupid mistakes for someone who thinks she is a world class fighter
MMA,not_removed,its not hindsight bias i havent been impressed with her last wins either she seems like she has a lot of talent but she hasnt seemed to improve that much in the last couple years
MMA,not_removed,he played with energy well and i didnt i fail to hear the props
MMA,not_removed,im not surprised contractnegotiation wolf tickets motherfuckers
MMA,not_removed,pepsi marketing themselves
MMA,not_removed,so you think thats the best grappling game plan she could muster her corner failed her
MMA,not_removed,shevchenkos latest win was pretty entertaining i think her fights can definitely be fun to watch im excited to see what happens between her and nunes i dont think we should tell fighters how they should behave in public or in the cage like luke thomas has said them fighting in the octogon should be enough
MMA,not_removed,thanks for being sensible i dont like pena much either but people are are being ridiculous why would pena being throwing weak knees she wants to finish fights it can really hard to see in real time what shots hit hard and what dont it seems every other finish someone looks like they barely touched and their lights turn off and i only get why after they show it slowed down in a replay
MMA,not_removed,i am not a fan of pena but what on earth are you talking about herb should break up a fighter actively throwing knees of course it does not matter if you throw knees if they are not doing any damage and barely connecting again liken it to someone sitting in closed guard and throwing super weak pokes to their opponents head to prevent a stand up the fact that you got up votes is a signal to the rest that they are blinded by hate or never even watched the fight to begin with pena threw strikes to shevs with accuracy i mean her throwing volume does not exactly hurt my point again you can land pokes from guard and still get stood up because you are not doing anything it is not on the ref at all to judge what is an effective strike and what isnt what yes it is if you are clinching or sitting in guard and only landing pokes to the opponents head it is down to the ref to separate if he deems you are not staying active enough
MMA,not_removed,id actually bet i do enjoy more in life than the average person partly because im hardly sarcastic that or literally of the people in my life are the douchiest bitchiest people on the planet ive been criticized many times for being too wellthis aint that bad hell look at my view on pena shes not particularly nice but her style isnt that bad if you dont prejudge someone after reading a single mere internet comment i bet youd enjoy everything about life more sounds equally ridiculous to your jab huh
MMA,not_removed,youre not serious he was very efficient he took shots well and he played with his energy well whereas i didnt i blew out he did not i felt i hurt him many times in the fight i abandoned the body shots they were doing damage but he caught me with one or two jabs to the body and i avoided his body then after that he played well he went into autopilot mode whereas i went into panic mode also bare in mind that was literally the first clip i found searching conor nate post fight
MMA,not_removed,but that isnt what sells fights if we as armchair fans are telling them how they should fight when its clear as day were perfectly justified in saying how they should be marketing themselves too if nothing else its good practice to help identify effective marketing methods for ourselves for when we need them in real life
MMA,not_removed,why would pena being throwing weak knees when her head coach tells people that body shots dont do anything what am i supposed to think
MMA,not_removed,of course it does not matter if you throw knees if they are not doing any damage and barely connecting again liken it to someone sitting in closed guard and throwing super weak pokes to their opponents head to prevent a stand up again she landed with accuracy which is very high for any mma fight many mma fights have under accuracy you cant say she wasnt connecting half the time in one comment then in the next say that her accuracy is proof of no power which is it barely connecting what a joke pena was more than connecting with those knees shev wasnt moving laterally from the fence to avoid them she was landing and doing damage it was quite obvious i just went back and reviewed the fight pena was landing hard enough to pick shevs heels off the ground with various body shots and inner thigh shots i mean you can literally see the impact on shevs body from her knees how on earth can you say they arent landing is shev doing a fake hop with each knee to pretend you are not doing anything again judges saw it different they deemed them effective herb deemed them effective what yes it is if you are clinching or sitting in guard and only landing pokes to the opponents head it is down to the ref to separate if he deems you are not staying active enough there is a far cry of difference between throwing a weak slap between a weak knee a punch is far more easily visible and a even a weak knee still has to potential for damage thats the difference herb pulling a fighter off another in guard for throwing pitter patter is because its easily visible what is in a punch the way the shoulders flex combined with speed penas strikes werent even close to being in that category her knees were landing quite fast and hard its not even in the discussion to debate if it was a pitter patter knee again you could see the visible impact from shev because shevs whole body would move from them from the impact pena was breathing with every shot and with decent form they were landing with enough authority that the judges deemed them an effective strike
MMA,not_removed,i am serious being a good punching bag and not gassing out do not register as props for me ill gladly wait for any other video you may want to share i never once heard him say he caught me or he hurt me he blames everything on his mismanagement of energy thats bs
MMA,not_removed,haha how you and i average citizens should market ourselves usually to prospective employers and some other forms of networking is entirely different from how fighters should market themselves to the public we shouldnt take cues from fighters for marketing lol
MMA,not_removed,watch the fight you can see shevs body move from the strikes
MMA,not_removed,dont argue with people who hate on fighters you like its a pointless thing to do because people see what they want to see i am usually a fan of the fighter that isnt liked such as ferguson jones etc pena being one of them she adds some spice to the womens division and her interviews can be fun and shes got a ton of heart in her fights
MMA,not_removed,you seriously are just pedantic and in denial and its quite strange
MMA,not_removed,she almost completely ignores them the knees clearly exist but shevchenko doesnt give a fuck
MMA,not_removed,yeah well thats like your opinion man dominick cruz is the best most recent example of a humbled loser giving an interview after a fight and my respect for him skyrocketted after that i get what conor is doing hes trying to save face and keep his rep as the bad ass as untarnished as possible so hell do shit like politicize answers chael also does to a whole different level but there is still that ability to drive the narrative in their favor while not lying overlooking certain truths im sorry youre taking this as pedantic or me being in some sort of personal denial its simply my opinion based on what ive seen and heard believe you me that im doing my best to decipher my reality as much as the next person and these are simply my thoughts cheers
MMA,not_removed,youve solved the case
MMA,not_removed,fair enough haha
MMA,not_removed,im on your side he used his energy well is the weakest praise i can imagine no acknowledgement of his fighting prowess the effects of his strikes his perseverance just pointing out that his energy was managed properly while you misused your own hardly seems a compliment edit dissenting opinions dismissed with downvotes seems a trend
MMA,not_removed,i remember roxanne modafferi saying theyd get sued for if they leaked any results whoever did this has a set of brass ones boy i tell ya hwat
MMA,not_removed,they deleted the tweet and the twitterbot didnt post a comment what was the tweet
MMA,not_removed,if this is true then someone is gonna get sued also why does this guy want to ruin who wins
MMA,not_removed,it would be hilarious if elliot got eliminated on the premiere
MMA,not_removed,mirror edit apparently the winner is for those curious no one has a mirror to the actual tweet though still
MMA,not_removed,mma writer jason coales who actually has broken some stuff before even commented on the post saying it is the worst kept secret in mma honestly elliot was way too good to be cut and is a top guy so mm will be fighting someone like reis which is fine didnt even know elliott was in the season
MMA,not_removed,well thats fucked up
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse is gonna have the easiest fight ever makes no sense
MMA,not_removed,i probably shouldnt have clicked on that link
MMA,not_removed,tuf the comeback
MMA,not_removed,thats fucking illegal
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse got out of fighting reis to fight tim elliot in a fight that will end up having much more fanfare due to the show id be pretty happy with that if i were mm
MMA,not_removed,he was my pick to win it absolutely would not be surprised
MMA,not_removed,is this season formatted differently i imagined theyd have a tuf finale ufc fight night like they always do the winner of that actual ufc fight would then fight mm
MMA,not_removed,dj just gunna keep streaming not even train after hearing its tim elliot fighting him next
MMA,not_removed,havent watched tuf in a while was really looking forward to this one knew that i would regret clicking on this link still did it totally regretting it
MMA,not_removed,if hes right this is embarrassing elliot was cut from the ufc after going shows you how talented this season is edit before anyone asks this season will not have a live finale instead it will be determined on the show mm will face the winner on the live finale card alongside cejudobenavidez
MMA,not_removed,when is tuf is it on today
MMA,not_removed,deleted what did it say
MMA,not_removed,i want to know what it sayseveryone have it
MMA,not_removed,if tim elliott won then demetrious johnson will continue to be the flyweight champ until
MMA,not_removed,spoiler mighty mouse beats the winner
MMA,not_removed,yall rememebr that elliot beat the hell out of banavidez for the majority of their fightwhile it lasted
MMA,not_removed,everyone pin it on ariel
MMA,not_removed,and the first episode hasnt even aired yet hahaha
MMA,not_removed,why does everyone have a belt in that pic
MMA,not_removed,i thought the winner gets decided on the tuf finale how could they possibly know the results of an event that hasnt happened
MMA,not_removed,wow i was actually looking forward to this season of tuf
MMA,not_removed,thats really bad if true this guy has already lost to half the ufc flyweight division in the ufc and had boring fights there to boot
MMA,not_removed,what would have happened if that fight with weis have gone through and he upsets mighty mouse surely theyll give him a rematch and probably scrap the season
MMA,not_removed,question isnt the finale usually live
MMA,not_removed,if this is true id pretty much guarantee his title shot is already taken away assuming the leak is from the winners camp
MMA,not_removed,this the same guy that guy lit up by ali b
MMA,not_removed,if this is the true the dude is so fucked hes a blue belt and he had a bad record beforejesus christ
MMA,not_removed,a guy whos lost to baugutinov joe b and dodson guys dj made seem like dont even deserve to wash his hand wraps
MMA,not_removed,i cant believe youve done this ufc
MMA,not_removed,elias theodorou said the same thing to benavidez in a qa last week
MMA,not_removed,the guy reporting it never signed a nda unless they can force him to give up his source i dont think the ufc can do anything can they
MMA,not_removed,plot twist it was joe silva
MMA,not_removed,maybe its tim elliot in hopes that hw gets stripped of the title shot and receiving a beatdown from mighty mouse
MMA,not_removed,a guy whose name rhymes with slim jelliot won the show tim elliot for those too lazy to look it up
MMA,not_removed,you were going to watch right
MMA,not_removed,if it was ariel helwani who did it then the reason is journalism
MMA,not_removed,if this is true then someone is gonna get sued tuf winners always come out nobody has ever gotten sued the only people the ufc would have a claim against would be the people working on the show and none of them are going to publicly reveal anything for the guy that reported it the ufc has no recourse besides banning him also why does this guy want to ruin who wins the next title challenger for a major world championship is undeniably newsworthy the role of the media is to report news its not ruining it although you can argue it wasnt the smartest thing for his career to do it in this way
MMA,not_removed,honestly elliot was way too good to be cut he went in a very shallow division maybe keep him on the early prelims for shows local to his hometown but its not like he was ever going to be so much as a gatekeeper
MMA,not_removed,yes just like gsp was against serra
MMA,not_removed,pretty much every fight is the easiest fight ever for dj at these days
MMA,not_removed,elliot has looked pretty solid since leaving the ufc obviously hes not fighting the level of mighty mouse but itll be a good fight
MMA,not_removed,tim had a hell of a fight be dotson could be fun
MMA,not_removed,he already had that against cejudo
MMA,not_removed,contrary to what this entire sub thinks i dont think mm is invincible and number
MMA,not_removed,not for this season they changed the format
MMA,not_removed,in a perfect scenario mm wouldve fought reis then tim elliot and finish off with the winner of cejudobenavidez hes trying to rack up title defenses
MMA,not_removed,the finale fight is the title fight vs dj he would be sitting out too long if he had to wait for the taped show a live finale and then the subsequent title defence
MMA,not_removed,shows you how talented this season is lets be honest if any of these guys were good enough to be in the ufc theyd already be here given how desperate the ufc is for talent at that level alongside cejudobenavidez title eliminator
MMA,not_removed,all those losses in that record were to the top of the division and most of them were close battles i actually saw him as the easy favorite because his style works well for the tuf format i wouldnt say its embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,haha imagine if the whole season is just the former ufc guys tearing through their fights to get to the finals and then just get butchered by mm in the finale
MMA,not_removed,you cant be talented if you lost close decisions to top fighters
MMA,not_removed,yeah i think this would be the worst possible outcome honestly on the face this looks like a guy who already had his limits proven by unranked fighters went out and beat every champion from other orgs even though its not really true it could be spun that there is no upcoming talent right now
MMA,not_removed,tomorrow i believe
MMA,not_removed,tim elliot won the show
MMA,not_removed,theyre all regional champions
MMA,not_removed,the winner between all of them vs might mouse was leaked too
MMA,not_removed,why have you been living under a rock
MMA,not_removed,tuf finale will be mm defending his title so the winner of the season has already happened
MMA,not_removed,then why did you click it
MMA,not_removed,if knowing the results ruin something for you you might want to stop being results orientated
MMA,not_removed,tim elliott could be many things but boring definitely isnt one of them
MMA,not_removed,they cant really do that though would defeat the entire purpose of the season
MMA,not_removed,he would have the most to lose out of anyone by leaking it and nothing to gain so it seems unlikely
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,yeah dodson looked so unworthy both times he clubbed him to the mat
MMA,not_removed,i always wonder why dana white hasnt died of rage strokes yet
MMA,not_removed,but wont he have to compete live to be the ultimate fighter or this season is straight to the title fight
MMA,not_removed,tuf josh gross hasnt been credentialed since interestingly he justified it by saying it was news because the winner got a title shot same as this season
MMA,not_removed,and rightly so these fighters sign a contract that under no circumstances can the results be released before each episode airs the only way this could have been revealed is if a fighter let it out id argue it wasnt a member of the production team as im sure they are hired regularly by the ufc if not full time for these things
MMA,not_removed,pretty much and i still am i just dont understand why this dude whats to potentially spoil the show for others obviously it can be argued that it will only be spoiled by people who saw this tweet but when the mma websited pick up on it then itll be more publicly out there on another note why the fuck did i click to find out
MMA,not_removed,tuf winners always come out
MMA,not_removed,his losses were to benavidez makovsky and baugotinov against the last he was very competitive he was also entertaining to watch as well he was a borderline top guy who just lost to the elite like you said its a shallow division to cutting him didnt make much sense
MMA,not_removed,sure that happened and rockhold lost to bisoing but for every wonderful underdog story there are a million dillashaw vs soto dillashaw v barao jones v sonnen and mcgregor v siver fights that were honestly just squash matches from the get go happening because of outside factors injury trash talk fighter build up and not because its the competitor fight that should happen strictly on a basis of talent
MMA,not_removed,not his last atleast not thought to be
MMA,not_removed,he had a rough run but all of his ufc bouts were exciting as hell too he was one of my favorite guys to watch for awhile
MMA,not_removed,they guy who has a olympic silver medal
MMA,not_removed,who would you say is then
MMA,not_removed,looks like theyll be changing it back
MMA,not_removed,ah that makes sense thanks
MMA,not_removed,its possible horiguchi could be in for a titleshot too if he beats bagautinov
MMA,not_removed,my brother always says this if youre american and youre fighting on the ultimate fighter its because youre good at a reality show if you were elite enough to be in the ufc youd be in the ufc which to some extent i believe most seasons most of the guys look like scrubs against the top and then even the top are cut within years
MMA,not_removed,he lost his last fights in the ufc and now hes going to fight for the title its embarrassing
MMA,not_removed,could be an advertisement for the quality of talent in the ufc our rejects beat the piss out of your best fighters kind of thing
MMA,not_removed,to see if it was real and if it is i wont make through the season without finding out anyway
MMA,not_removed,one of my favorite fights is him vs jared papazian jared acted like a douche and hit him with a hard illegal knee but tim just took a minute or two and still fucked him up i was a fan after that
MMA,not_removed,theyve swapped finalists in the past for various reasons
MMA,not_removed,i was so pissed at this fight i loved elliots style and thought he was robbed bad fun fight though
MMA,not_removed,what i dont think were referring to the same thing
MMA,not_removed,didnt something like that happen at brock lesnars ufc debut
MMA,not_removed,there is nothing they can do unless that person volunteers to give the source almost zero ability to have the person name the source in a civil lawsuit
MMA,not_removed,the wiki says the finale will be dj making his title defense against the winner of the tournament httpsenwikipediaorgwikitheultimatefighterteambenavidezvsteamcejudobackground
MMA,not_removed,and he was right
MMA,not_removed,theres also an audience of people that watch the fights
MMA,not_removed,i clicked because i dun give a fook needer
MMA,not_removed,yea hes like actively seeking more sources too i get if someone came to you with the info but what does he gain from leaking it besides a few twitter impressions
MMA,not_removed,theyve confused you into thinking this isnt a sport just like baseball or basketball we dont live in the ufcs little bubble and news is news if people want to watch the show and be surprised from week to week then thats their responsibility
MMA,not_removed,sherdog released the names of the finalists for tuf at least twice if i remember correctly it was in retaliation for pulling their press credentials tuf for sure and maybe tuf
MMA,not_removed,you have a reality show with people working on itaround it and fighters that leave the show knowing who is in the finals the finals always get out most just dont see them because the big sites dont report them for obvious reasons with the grosstuf thing being the exception
MMA,not_removed,ronda vs holm was supposed to be squash
MMA,not_removed,thats what gsp vs serra was supposed to be a squash match and look what happened there
MMA,not_removed,difference is serra was new to ufc except for all those ufc fights he had before winning the final
MMA,not_removed,i actually used serra as the example because he got his title shot through winning tuf as well
MMA,not_removed,and yet were
MMA,not_removed,i think it was a bronze
MMA,not_removed,gold
MMA,not_removed,doesnt make any sense to begin with but mm is the most dominant champ right now
MMA,not_removed,jon jones i dont care if everyone hates him mm has the benefit of a weaker division but overall jones has shown more dominance while mm has been defeated before and knocked down a few times i put mm at number
MMA,not_removed,not op but id still have jones as my ive never seen someone who goes out and employs his opponents strategy against them like jones has hes a wonder to watch in the cage hes got his issues outside the cage and i dont really like him as a person but im a big fan of watching him fight
MMA,not_removed,he had nothing for mm and hasnt done anything to deserve a rematch hes going to need at least more wins edit holy shit hes tied for third in the rankings and hasnt faced anyone currently flyweight is literally as shallow as the kiddie pool
MMA,not_removed,well look at last tuf winner ryan hall he won in a decision against artem lobov both of which have lost before in their tuf run but were brought back
MMA,not_removed,watch the fights you might actually discover the guy can scrap jesus youre acting like a guy cant grow
MMA,not_removed,no dude i only clicked spoilers winner of mcgregor vs diaz ii says to see who won but it fucking ruined it for me
MMA,not_removed,when have they swapped finalists
MMA,not_removed,elliots losses were to top guys and they were all competitive he even had benavidez in a bit of trouble before eventually succumbing to the guillotine choke he is definitely ufc caliber and just a slight notch below reis imo
MMA,not_removed,we are
MMA,not_removed,i just seen a video on that about the refs yesterday i thought that bit was a joke or was that really the cause lol
MMA,not_removed,the final is almost always the two coaches fighting each other with the tuf finale as the comain
MMA,not_removed,not to mention a full crew producing the show
MMA,not_removed,you wont do nutn
MMA,not_removed,still no citations show many any site reporting them
MMA,not_removed,only to fans that watch mma so that they have something relevant to say in their sunday morning facebook status a lot of educated fight fans suspected holly being a nightmare match up for ronda to be clear im not claiming to be part of the latter however i did bet a on the upset with a friend and won a on odds
MMA,not_removed,hes replying to a guy who said the same thing a fuck load more likely that squash matches go the way theyre meant to than the random anomaly happening
MMA,not_removed,wasnt it called the comeback season
MMA,not_removed,whoooooosh
MMA,not_removed,mm was still working partially at the time its more than understandable
MMA,not_removed,even after popping really edit dj just took an olympic gold medal wrestler and took him into the clinch and manhandled him id call that employing his opponents strategy against them
MMA,not_removed,and most of their feet cant touch the bottom lol now rmma i know we get sensitive about this sometimes but its a joke
MMA,not_removed,but having a close fight against anyone is not a good sign if youre gunna fight mm
MMA,not_removed,jesse taylor
MMA,not_removed,i was shocked when i found out elliot was only a blue belt considering how slick his grappling looks took benavidez down three times and even kept him in a crucifix for a bit
MMA,not_removed,youre referring to the decision dj has over dodson right yknow the one where dodson had knockdowns and was outstruck and taken down times with total minutes spent on the bottom
MMA,not_removed,cejudo and benavidez is comain but the final has been taped for the season and the winner is facing dj at the final
MMA,not_removed,none for good reason
MMA,not_removed,a lot of educated fight fans suspected holly being a nightmare match up for ronda nobody thought that holly was a nightmare matchup some people thought that holly could win these arent the same thing
MMA,not_removed,yeah it was basically the washed up tuf season
MMA,not_removed,i guess i missed the hilarious joke somehow
MMA,not_removed,i agree its great for casuals but it needs a new title pound for pound used as a hypothetical list of who could beat who if they weighed the same is extremely flawed it cannot accurately be done is all i am saying but i do agree mighty mouse is the most dominant fighter in the ufc right now
MMA,not_removed,and saul rodgers but jesse was the example i would use for this situation
MMA,not_removed,unlike a lot of places his gym reserves bjj belts for bjj
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah forgot about that isnt tony ferguson fighting rda in the same event
MMA,not_removed,alright holly had legitimate potential to beat ronda unlike any of her previous opponents to date either way my point was that there was a good percentage of fans that believed ronda would lose that night
MMA,not_removed,cejudo wouldnt shut up about how he was a gold medalist and brought it up every chance he got i assumed op was making a joke about it
MMA,not_removed,i knew he wrestled didnt know he was a national champ that makes a lot of sense
MMA,not_removed,no that fight is in mexico city
MMA,not_removed,holly was a couple of days before the fight and finalised at around a very small minority of fans believed that ronda would lose a larger minority believed that ronda could lose if you dont believe me go read the beforefight thread
MMA,not_removed,cm punk vs wonderboy was the fight to make imo two elite strikers
MMA,not_removed,when you look at his paths to victory and put all other bullshit aside things look very bad for punk win by submission no chance gall is way more experienced ko with limited striking experience it is very unlikely that punk has the timing and precision to land a clean ko punch im assuming that he cant kick for shit tko this is the most likely scenario for a punk win gall takes him down a scramble goes badly gall ends up on his back against the cage punk somehow is on top landing strikes the ref stops it probably a controversial stoppage punk gets the w decision surely over the course of full rounds punk isnt going to out score gall so id agree with the general consensus that punk has about a chance of winning
MMA,not_removed,i dont see it happening theres nothing that cm punk excels at brock was an elite wrestler cm punks just some guy who loves fighting
MMA,not_removed,realistically the chances arent very goodbut its mma and everything could happen so i wouldnt count him out
MMA,not_removed,low but he obviously has a chance theres a lot of pressure on gall too one mistake and punk could capitalize
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,realistically nobody knows
MMA,not_removed,the people who are basing his ability in this fight on his toughness are a bit deluded to be honest hes done in one
MMA,not_removed,dude once he hits gall with the gts he then will lock on the anaconda vice its over unless punk tries to pin gall and herb dean counts and the match could end that way too
MMA,not_removed,he has been training every single day with one of the best gyms in the country i would give him like a percent chance
MMA,not_removed,i personally have a hard time picking someone who ive never seen fight over someone i have particularly when the reason ive never seen that person fight is because they never have gall has won fights and looked pretty good doing it so i have no reason to pick against him in this fight
MMA,not_removed,his best chances will be getting gall to engage in a dogfight then he can hope that he has more grit and heart
MMA,not_removed,the ufc would benefit way more financially with a punk win stranger things have happened
MMA,not_removed,none of us know weve never seen him compete
MMA,not_removed,really unlikely gall is no joke i think thats a tough fight for punk to be honest big step up well see what kind of level he is at
MMA,not_removed,very low
MMA,not_removed,most people on this sub have never seen gall fight but they will confidently tell you that they know for sure whats going to happen
MMA,not_removed,ill give brooks a
MMA,not_removed,tree fitty
MMA,not_removed,anything can happen in a fight
MMA,not_removed,whats the vegas line
MMA,not_removed,anyone has a chance however i doubt he does well
MMA,not_removed,gall isnt exactly ufc caliber either he was chosen because he was at the time and they gave him a second fight for promotional purposes against a guy that was literally with one amateur fight which he lost and the guy before that was as well i dont like punks chances and the trainingsparring footage that came out a few days ago was pretty damning but years at roufusport training with guys like pettis vs a guy whos against the lowest level of competition possible isnt impossible odds to me
MMA,not_removed,i think a lot of people underestimate punk i for one dont see him going down i think he has a lot more willpower than people think even if he doesnt have elite technique im expecting a war to be frank
MMA,not_removed,i was the theorizing in another post that the videos being released were made to look purposely bad so that it looks more like an underdog story and on fight night he comes looking a lot better than those videos
MMA,not_removed,as hilarious as this situation is i think punk wins
MMA,not_removed,nobody knows nobody knows what hes like
MMA,not_removed,tbh id rather see cm punk fight robbie lawler after lawlers been through rounds of war
MMA,not_removed,did you just call cm punk an elite striker
MMA,not_removed,the round kick was actually one of punks signature moves in wrestling
MMA,not_removed,anything can happen though id love to see someone ko somebody while putting together a submission followed by a roundhouse kick i can dream can i
MMA,not_removed,gall could come in really cockly and get caught fucking around not taking it seriously i honestly think thats punks best chnace
MMA,not_removed,khabib knows
MMA,not_removed,no his best advantage is that he has experience in big events and gall doesnt so he might feel the pressure but that most likely wont be even close to enough to cover the skill disparity
MMA,not_removed,doesnt look like hes learned much at all
MMA,not_removed,i think chance is probably too optimistic sure hes training at a good gym but theres only so much they can do with a year old guy walking in with zero experience and multiple surgeries in such a short time period even if they managed to get his skill set up to par theres still an enormous age gap thatll be hard to overcome his reflexes simply wont be as good as a year old in their athletic prime roufusport may have taught him how to block punches etc but that wont matter if his reaction time isnt good enough im actually rooting for punk would like to see him win and prove all the doubters wrong but realistically id put his chances of winning at more like
MMA,not_removed,maybe hell go and defend it in bellator or one fc hell he might take it back to the wwe and defend it there
MMA,not_removed,saw gall fight he looks like a real future prospect with some already impressive performances cm punk meanwhile is pushing has never been in a fight spars with people that treat him with kiddy gloves and has striking that honestly looks worse than a lot of beginners zero chance gall would have to suffer an aneurysm for cm to win
MMA,not_removed,dont know why youre being downvoted its true i can also guarantee that if i bet my life on gall beating punk punk would win
MMA,not_removed,galls around and punks around if i remember right value in gall at that price to be honest
MMA,not_removed,willpower doesnt stop you from going to sleep
MMA,not_removed,why do you want lawler to die
MMA,not_removed,he was also quite sarcastic
MMA,not_removed,yeah lol has nothing to do with who i actually think will win the fight gall looks sharp punk doesnt im not in the gym with those guys so i dont know shit what i do know is that after watching nearly years of mma and another of boxing kickboxing judo and karate tournaments on top of that is that anything can happen someone will have a good day the other guy will learn what he needs to work on either way we get to watch a fight everyone wins
MMA,not_removed,also why would anyone give a shit about upvotes or downvotes im here to discuss and learn not for a popularity contest
MMA,not_removed,i expected likeholly holm vs rousey numbers damn
MMA,not_removed,wouldnt bet on that fight maybe a small bet on brooks
MMA,not_removed,youd be surprised
MMA,not_removed,lol idk been wondering since i joined reddit if i get downvoted i just laugh
MMA,not_removed,gall only has pro fights so its not like punk is fighting the best at ww so im not surprised the numbers are close
MMA,not_removed,why though gall isnt exactly a known commodity he could very well turn out to be complete trash in mma
MMA,not_removed,i think youd be surprised having never been hit in the face by a naturally athletic ww who spends every day of his life training to knock people out
MMA,not_removed,jedrzejczyk vs esparza
MMA,not_removed,rda vs pettis
MMA,not_removed,vitor took silvas sole
MMA,not_removed,barbozaterry etim
MMA,not_removed,usada vs vitor
MMA,not_removed,koschecks had his soul taken in the rematch against gsp he hasnt been the same fighter since whenever he gets hit he is constantly touching his face to make sure it is okay you can tell be his facial expressions he is afraid of taking damage
MMA,not_removed,silva vs franklin utterly crushed ill never forget when franklin looked at himself on the big screen as they announced the winner and he just said ah fuck his face was smashed to hell
MMA,not_removed,holly holm vs ronda rousey
MMA,not_removed,maybe not exactly what youre after but maia vs condit condit just looked completely deflated after the human backpack claimed his back as his own after the wars hes been in over the years i think this was the moment he realised its over all his social media has been locked down on private with no updates whatsoever since highly doubt well see him compete ever again
MMA,not_removed,holm vs ronda for sure
MMA,not_removed,bit of a bold prediction here but i wont be shocked if cerrone isnt the same after masvidal handled him its gotta be so discouraging building momentum that many times in your career and always falling shy of the mark when youre on the cusp weve seen him rebuild before but hes gotta fizzle out eventually and a loss that devastating could very well be the beginning of that
MMA,not_removed,cro cop vs wanderei silva for a long time no one knocked out wanderlei like that before and in future fights after that ko it was like every other guy managed to knock him out too
MMA,not_removed,bader vs perosh complete mismatch bader beat the fuck out of him for minutes edit i only read the complete dismantling part of your post
MMA,not_removed,old school but evan tanner against dave terrell
MMA,not_removed,not mma but cro cop vs bob sapp although he did beat a couple of dudes since i think that fight put true fear into sapp and set him on the track of turning from the nigh indestructible beast he was perceived as into well whatever the hell he is now
MMA,not_removed,jones vs shogun
MMA,not_removed,rockhold vs machida

MMA,not_removed,without a doubt makowski beat serras ass until he literally couldnt stand up anymore literally retired him from the sport kelvin gastelum vs tim kennedy kelvin just tooled tim if you watch the fight there are several times where tim locks in his bread and butter hold and knees kelvin in the asslegs kelvin kept calm literally looked to his corner and says oh dont worry im just resting ill spin out in a bit then bam he spins out kenndy retired after that match hendricks vs appitite watch some of the weigh ins his coaches telling stories about having to follow him home so he wouldnt visit fast food stores him having a meeting with his family regarding missing weightfighting and still failing etc he was on a slump for a long time due to his appetite ronda vs holm literally broke her it was an amazing showcase of film work strategy and developing a strong game plan it make ronda look like some soccer mom who wandered into the ring she was read like some sort of simple book after the match ronda contemplated suicide and apparently took shits in her yard it make it look like ronda was afraid of any strikes afterwards as shown by nunes

MMA,not_removed,i feel that yair rodriguez took bj penns soul
MMA,not_removed,i would say penne too
MMA,not_removed,carla should be since then decisionbot esparza markos
MMA,not_removed,this was only the beginning of a long downfall
MMA,not_removed,god listening to the corner audio going into the final round was pretty brutal pettis just looked like he had nothing left
MMA,not_removed,rda looked surprisingly bigger i remember this was one of the first i ever saw before i was a fan and i thought it was unfair that they put a guy that was clearly so much smaller and worse than rda in a rounder had no idea how much of a world beater pettis was
MMA,not_removed,usada took pettis soul
MMA,not_removed,nice
MMA,not_removed,wandys
MMA,not_removed,also when he destroyed bj fights ago it was a beating and a half
MMA,not_removed,shit eddie broke his spirit for sure but he still thought he was a contender until nate diaz murked him add thats whats up hungry nate diaz to the list of fabled monsters
MMA,not_removed,turned him into a mannequin shit was fucked up edit the clip httpimgurcomaqhdef
MMA,not_removed,hes running into oncoming traffic the last thing i read about him unfortunately i think that kick did really mess him up
MMA,not_removed,this is the correct answer
MMA,not_removed,yeah i think its cause he broke his orbital bone
MMA,not_removed,cool story bro here check out these kneees real quick
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,in this case both fighters had their souls stolen that or holm wasnt really good enough to consistently win in that division
MMA,not_removed,condit was talking about retiring since the lawler fightit didnt surprise me that maia won quickly
MMA,not_removed,cerrone has recovered from even worse losses
MMA,not_removed,this fight was pretty much my introduction to mma i was into wrestling at the time so a family friend gave me some mma magazines and one had wanderlei on the cover i searched him and the first thing that came up was the second crocop fight this was just after it had happened in so after reading a long piece on how much of a savage wand was the first thing i saw was him getting absolutely wrecked for a while my interest in mma sort of ended there as it gave me the impression fights couldnt really be back and forth it was just a case of one bigger guy destroying a smaller one also after watching it i thought crocop must have been the most lethal guy on the planet fast forward a while and i decide to search for crocop again only to see gonzaga ice him this was when i decided anything could happen in this uniquely exciting sport been a fan ever since
MMA,not_removed,probably my favorite fight of all time
MMA,not_removed,decisionbot bader perosh
MMA,not_removed,bader vs lil nog as well that was depressing
MMA,not_removed,he got knocked out in of his remaining three fights after ill allow it perosh deserved it for kicking bjj whiz and resident cocky asshole vinny magalhaes out of the ufc though and hes aussie so fuck him glad he got wrecked
MMA,not_removed,shogun didnt look that bad afterwards and is on quite the streak right now jones mauled him though
MMA,not_removed,id argue it was the knee surgery just before that fight that already did him in not saying hed have beaten jones just that he never seemed to recover as well as he eventually did after the first im sure that beating in his first fight back didnt help edit forgot to say surgery like an idiot
MMA,not_removed,luke and gay jesus also did a lot of damage to the chris yoel split him wide open and luke beat him like he caught him screwing his wife
MMA,not_removed,i love lyoto but i think usada took his soul before that
MMA,not_removed,poor diego let his anger work against him in that fight
MMA,not_removed,gsp penn took my soul
MMA,not_removed,maldobobo is far too tough for his own good thought i was gonna see a death in the cage
MMA,not_removed,i mean depends on what you consider one sided at least he stayed awake for longer than seconds unlike his heavyweight debut against stipe
MMA,not_removed,the little eagle flys again
MMA,not_removed,best answer most of the posts here are mere knockouts they dont answer ops question khabibs complete domination of trujillo is painful to look at at one point trujillo actually extended his arms to his sides as if to say its hopeless i have no chance
MMA,not_removed,came here to say this
MMA,not_removed,decisionbot nurmagomedov trujillo
MMA,not_removed,i think its more that after the silva fight he got generally more difficult opponents than before dude was always the perfect gatekeeper
MMA,not_removed,leben was an overachiever who ran into one of the greatest fighters ever his soul was taken by oxy and alcohol addiction he fought in while in withdrawal more than once
MMA,not_removed,silva took a few souls my favorite was vs chael where he just stares into chaels soul after the spinning backfist
MMA,not_removed,calm down eddie didnt even have another fight yet lol
MMA,not_removed,eddie just got caught early and never recovered conor looked like he just got whooped by his step dad after the first nate fight and we all saw how he came back cant count eddie out based on one performance shit happens when you get punched in the face for a living
MMA,not_removed,wouldnt say he took his soul jds has a title shot coming up and is looking really good right now i have him oveer stipe again
MMA,not_removed,what happened to matt makowski
MMA,not_removed,eddie hasnt fought since so its a bit premature to claim conor took his soul
MMA,not_removed,edgar vs penn iii
MMA,not_removed,he took his nose
MMA,not_removed,macdonald dosent have a soul just like lawler the were filling the void with each others blood

MMA,not_removed,gunner has been successful since he seems fine
MMA,not_removed,hasnt fought yet im not wicked smart in the politics of mma but nates a big draw right now and i dont think hes been in this position previously hes either waiting for the trilogy fight or another good money opportunity to build his draw more

MMA,not_removed,terrys decline has been dramatic these days he can be found running into buses one of three he ran into eyewitnesses claimed that the jumped out of a ford focus car on a busy road and started darting in and out of traffic he got injured in the process of throwing himself on the windshields of four vehicles leaving one of them completely shattered according to a report by the liverpool echo eyewitnesses reported seeing a man in his running amok on east prescot road this afternoon it appeared he threw himself against as many as four vehicles including three singledecker stagecoach and arriva buses all except one were believed to be stationary at the time he was eventually restrained by police and taken to hospital his condition was this evening described as serious an eyewitness hairdresser andrea mccullough said his friends were running after him and trying to restrain him on the floor but he managed to break free and was running in and around all the cars he wasnt trying to harm anybody but himself he was covered from head to toe in blood etim was discharged from hospital last week and is recovering at home
MMA,not_removed,dunno how to feel about spinning hook kicks in mma on the one hand theyre incredible to look at and i can watch guys like barboza and lando throw them all daybut on the other hand they result in absolutely brutal knockouts this one clearly fucked up terry etim uriah halls ko on tuf seemed to have similar effects
MMA,not_removed,drugs probably had more to do with it than that kick
MMA,not_removed,fyi the medical term for it is broke his whole shit
MMA,not_removed,really gonna give that shit eating emoji to a pioneer of the sport getting her body smashed like that you dont have to like her but god damn have some respect
MMA,not_removed,i would say maybe thats a little unfair on holly look at her last fights after that one she was very possibly winning the tate fight until she let her guard down got too relaxed and allowed miesha to scramble to her back props to miesha of course but still i think if you ran that one back again holly would win she got taken to a decision by shevchenko who is easily one of the most talented fighters in that division and may very well be the next champion she lost a suuuuuper close decision against de randamie in a fight in which she got hit hard after the bell twice and rocked de randamie with a kick many think she should have won that fight im not saying holm is the goat or anything i just think that your comment implies that holm has just been a complete can since the ronda fight and when you look at the facts thats not really a fair assessment
MMA,not_removed,i think its the latter
MMA,not_removed,think condits fight with lawler affected them both more than they or us would like to admit was an amazing fight and war but damn both of those guys took so much damage
MMA,not_removed,true that but i think johnbugara is talking about the cumulative effect of disappointing outcomes on these cerrone hot streaks i think cowboy will be all right mentally doesnt seem the type to mope and feel sorry for himself too long
MMA,not_removed,i dont even know if thats true cowboy basically got knocked out twice in his hometown because of that fucky situation with herb dean stopping the fight at the bell and before this win jorge wasnt even high up in the rankings everyone else he has lost to in the ufc at least had some name power i wouldnt be surprised if this is the loss that really kills him

MMA,not_removed,yeah but hes just not the same not as aggressive but yeah i agree took him a while but hes back on track
MMA,not_removed,fair point but the fight was so hyped and seemed just so easy for conor i know it was soon after but when eddie was on chaels podcast eddie sounded beyond depressed was hard to listen to

MMA,not_removed,i thought that was a bs made up story because it sounded unbelievable but it wow ill hope hell be ok
MMA,not_removed,what the damn hell i thought you were kidding that shit is so crazy i wonder if the crazy behaviour is all brain damage related or if he had some other issues
MMA,not_removed,thats true the victim of the spin kick from luke rockhold v chris weidman never truly recovered
MMA,not_removed,fists and shins do worse and more often
MMA,not_removed,and gambling from what ive heard from people close to him
MMA,not_removed,you a doctor or some shit
MMA,not_removed,her game plan was completely delusional and she deserved to get kod
MMA,not_removed,i think it is more of a case of styles rousey was a perfect style matchup for holm and holm looked amazing beating her in all of the fights since she has looked significantly worse than she did in the rousey fight i also think those fights were not easy style matchups
MMA,not_removed,youre not giving miesha enough credit round was a on every judges scorecard and round was looking to be the same holm didnt let her guard down or allow miesha to do anything mieshas wrestling and grappling dominated hollys
MMA,not_removed,yes exactly not only that but he had never lost that badly that was a legit ko at the end of round a stoppage would have been a great call imo he was in terrible shape on the stool the other finishes all seemed to stem from bodyshots which he or others could somewhat attribute to his past health issues if they wanted to but weve never seen him chinned like that before masvidal
MMA,not_removed,oh jesus that is so much worse than i expected
MMA,not_removed,tart logic is one thing be retarted unacceptable
MMA,not_removed,i came here to review reports on the post about whether it belongs in the general discussion thread but then found ops gem of a comment not sure what is worse saying that perosh deserved to get fucked up because hes australian or dissing australians in a sub where a fair few mods are aussies either way would love to see how this goes
MMA,not_removed,no fucking shit hes gonna be upset after all the build up to the fight to have it end up like that if he wasnt emotional after the fight i would have been amazed
MMA,not_removed,didnt you see his fight vs rothwell jds was teeping like king leonidas and throwing overhand rights like big bens face was an affront to juniors way of life though i agree the dos santos we saw in the overeem fight was far from aggressive

MMA,not_removed,niceeeeeeee
MMA,not_removed,yeah i thought the buses would be other opponents i was waiting to read more references to how it was a joke but they never came
MMA,not_removed,does anyone know if it was the kick that left him like this or if its like an emotional issue that is so crazy poor guy
MMA,not_removed,im not convinced by that obviously you see some brutal knockouts from both punches and kicks but its very rare to see the kind of knockouts we saw from barboza or uriah the average clean punch or high kick might well knock someone out but not out coldconvulsing as the above examples did while sample size is small with spinning hook kicks such knockouts seem much more common which makes sense since youre torquing your entire body generating power from your posterior chain and connecting the hardest part of your foot to the chin
MMA,not_removed,her gameplan was bullrush into the clinch as shed done every other time and hollys ringcraft and counterpunching wouldnt let that happen and yeah she might be a bitch but respect how much shes done for the sport she just launched mma into the mainstream
MMA,not_removed,good points ronda is pretty much a pure grappler with lets face it really shoddy boxing and she tried to have a striking match against a multipletime world striking champion that was only ever gonna go one way on the other hand both shevchenko and de randamie are striking phenoms tates win is a bit more of an anomaly because honestly i think holly wins that fight at least times out of and we just happened to see one of the
MMA,not_removed,rtherewasanattempt
MMA,not_removed,cerrone is my favorite fighter but that match was straight bullshit and he deserved that beating he did zero research into masvidal before walking in the ring didnt watch his videos to see his weaknesses didnt talk go his past opponents to learn how to move nothing dude walked in there with every intention of getting his ass beat as much as i love him as a fighter i feel like he is going to wind up as the gatekeeper
MMA,not_removed,i dont usually agree with him on a lot but schaub was right about cowboy having a quick turnaround after the matt brown fight he was dropped imo if youre dropped in a fight you should automatically be given a month medical suspension
MMA,not_removed,pretty much whats wrong with mma scoring perosh wasnt in thst fight for a second and only one round got given across scores
MMA,not_removed,decisionbot petz morgan edit check out that only one ever in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,that that isnt how moderating should be done
MMA,not_removed,im a kiwi we have a strong sporting rivalry with australia which i love to hype up because it tends not to get the respect it deserves it is admittedly difficult to convey tone using just words though
MMA,not_removed,eh at a risk of downvotes i kind of agree with urealniceandtight the way dos santos fought before his second cain fight very aggressive always moving forward behind his jab and every fight afterwards tentative keeping his opponent at a distance and counter punching is rather difference whether that constitutes losing your soul or not dos santos has switched up his game a bit
MMA,not_removed,yeah i know i thought the bot also made desicions in fights that had a finish with an algorythm but now i know it doesnt
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt say she made it a striking match but she tried to bullrush through rather than actually be tactical

MMA,not_removed,well if the intent of the ban is to prevent bodily harm to americans this seems appropriate
MMA,not_removed,trump wont be able to stop the moosetrain
MMA,not_removed,mousasi has brought this on himself if he wanted to come to america to fight and entertain the public then he should have planned ahead and been born in a different country
MMA,not_removed,but meryl streep told me id get to keep mma and football
MMA,not_removed,good he was taking an americans spot at ufc so hopefully they replace him with a real american like hulk hogan
MMA,not_removed,donald trump youre taking everything i worked for motherfucker i wanna fight your fuckin ass
MMA,not_removed,this is number bullshit
MMA,not_removed,weidman playing the long game by being a trump supporter before this fight was even announced
MMA,not_removed,so far ive been willing to give trump the benefit of the doubt but if he denies me my moose it might be the straw that breaks the camels back
MMA,not_removed,born in iran
MMA,not_removed,from google translatethe coarse measure of newfangled american president donald trump now exceeds possibly a known victim gegard mousasi sometimes could hear that he is not allowed in the country for ufc the dutchman who was born in iran said in an interview with telesport that the measure will also take him as possible ufc is only a few months but mousasi is not assured i have the dutch nationality but i also have a visa but even with a visa you get in trouble i heard so i hear it this week though the ufc lawyers are busy and the people who arrange the visas too so it is not in my hands my job is to train and get ready for the game well its annoying the impending invliegverbod it do not shoot so this is not the right direction i think there seems to me a bit too much turmoil in the world and this is certainly not a positive way for years there working relationships between countries and now with trump go all these years that worked piece i think its a bit of an arrogant guy he does things his way but i think he has little understanding of politics i wait for this week off and stay quiet in training which is also good for the next game whenever that may be it appears that mousasi the storm itself actually see hanging well i think race cancel and then see if we can fight or something somewhere in europe
MMA,not_removed,cmon moose anybody else feel bad for a guy who filed his papers and never did terrorism outside of the cage
MMA,not_removed,make mousasi sassy again
MMA,not_removed,only logical solution move ufc to iran
MMA,not_removed,did everyone forget dana is best buds with trump gerard will be fine
MMA,not_removed,this is where i draw the line
MMA,not_removed,rmma is conflicted now
MMA,not_removed,dana white will call up his buddy and get him in this is how oligarchy works
MMA,not_removed,im sorry but preventing someone from earning their livelihood is a douchey thing to do if trump is a fan of mma like he claims he is he will personally see to it that the moose is able to fight
MMA,not_removed,as difficult as it may be i think hes got enough time to go threw the new process and get cleared before its too late from what ive read if it does actually hold him up that long would be very upsetting
MMA,not_removed,any confirmation on this wiki says he moved to netherlands when he was im willing to bet he has a netherlands passport
MMA,not_removed,what i thought he was a dutch citizen
MMA,not_removed,its a ban retroactive from when anybody know ufc is april i really hope theres a way around this
MMA,not_removed,nooooooooo
MMA,not_removed,well now hes crossed the line but really wonder how many athletes people who big business might actually care about are affected
MMA,not_removed,ufc lawyers
MMA,not_removed,better put him on the london card quick
MMA,not_removed,he is a christian armenianiranian how is that going to impact him he is not from the hot spots
MMA,not_removed,let me bang bro
MMA,not_removed,fuck
MMA,not_removed,i asked mousasi via twitter if he would be able to due to the ban but hes not very active right now there hope ariel or someone else nails an interview or something he was born in iran but is ethnically an armenian and moved to netherlands as a kid if they dumped his iranian citizenship and made him instead a dual dutcharmenian citizen it shouldnt hurt him
MMA,not_removed,dude what the fuck
MMA,not_removed,this is guaranteed to be a non issue
MMA,not_removed,i think there is an exemption for athletes
MMA,not_removed,thought hes dutch national
MMA,not_removed,as a dutch guy gvd
MMA,not_removed,hes armenian like the kardashianskim and kanye can step in to help him out
MMA,not_removed,dana ya better call up your fuckin buddy
MMA,not_removed,maybe ufc london will get a decent card now
MMA,not_removed,become canadian o right we suck for fighting too our laws sorry moose we have em but not like you
MMA,not_removed,i heard that certain individuals such as celebrities athletes etc are exempt from this so hopefully ze moose gets loose
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure dana white can find a way to fix this in addition to his connection to trump that will be interesting to see it play out i would be surprised if mousasi couldnt fight in the us
MMA,not_removed,the luck of mousasi come oooohn he is dutch
MMA,not_removed,i am sure they will make a special exception
MMA,not_removed,the executive order has provisionsexception clauses for government officials and athletes so this article seems poorly researched
MMA,not_removed,thats be hilarious

MMA,not_removed,i guess same ban could apply to makwan amirkhani who was born in iran although he is a kurd and i am not sure hes a muslim didnt trump say something about religious minorities from these countries being exempt from the ban mousasi is christian and im not sure about amirkhani
MMA,not_removed,im happy that there are enough funny memes to lighten the situation before i try to write an angry post
MMA,not_removed,i thought there was some exemption to athletes and stuff read about it somewhere
MMA,not_removed,can someone do us the pleasure of a translation
MMA,not_removed,he has a dutch passport lol
MMA,not_removed,real talk it supposedly has language in the eo that exempts foreign athletes hopefully situations like this will get worked out in time
MMA,not_removed,this is bullshit i believe he has a netherlands passport and can compete if he flies in with it also hes fighting in may or june after the ban expires the article is clear click bait and just another attempt by certain forces to recruit people against the president
MMA,not_removed,looks like hell be okay
MMA,not_removed,huge if true
MMA,not_removed,hell be fine quit spreading fake news
MMA,not_removed,appeals are possible on a case by case basis hell make it in
MMA,not_removed,the eo gives a pass to politicians and athletes your precious moose will not be denied he has a long history of not being a terrorist
MMA,not_removed,can we all keep in mind that criticizing macro policy based on micro factors individual people that are inconvenienced is intellectually dishonest if you disagree with the policy citing stories like this is a very poor way to do it
MMA,not_removed,anyone who has worked a real job in their life knows that rollouts are almost always sloppy i assume by the time rolls around the details will be fixed and he will fight but visas get denied all the time for fighters keep that in mind for example and no this doesnt make me a trump supporter im just sick of everyone going glenn beck level bat shit crazy on the left
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if dana is still a big fan of trump hes taking danas money now
MMA,not_removed,this is so fucking stupid this is not gonna happen did anyone here read the executive order
MMA,not_removed,dana can get an exemption he and trump are friends dana gave a speech at the rnc convention no worries fight fans
MMA,not_removed,wut
MMA,not_removed,i think its my understanding that people such as athletes celebrities etc are not banned
MMA,not_removed,wait isnt he coming out of europe not one of the countries listed
MMA,not_removed,hahahah
MMA,not_removed,mousasi is exempt because he is an athlete if you do any readying into the executive order you would know that
MMA,not_removed,if you actually read the whole executive order this will have zero effect on him it was rolled out quickly to not give bad guys a heads up to rush in and this caused a ton of confusion at the airports
MMA,not_removed,dana will get an exemption for mousasi hes good friends with trump but this also makes mousasi danas bitch now
MMA,not_removed,this shit is hillarious
MMA,not_removed,ive been wondering if trumps immigration policy could eventually spell problems for khabib with him being muslim but hopefully his being russian will actually be a benefit
MMA,not_removed,i understand wanting to keep politics out of this sub but in this case it is relevant just like the former ban in ny if people want to argue about trump fine go ahead and delete it but if people are talking about the fact that a ufc fighters career and our sport are being negatively impacted by a law then it seems like a worthwhile discussion
MMA,not_removed,shillary cuck have to assume thats a joke report its too comedic for anyone actually trying to get something across
MMA,not_removed,celery shuck
MMA,not_removed,im hysterical laughing at that report hahahaha
MMA,not_removed,i agree i see enough shitty politics on my facebook and the homepage thanks for keeping the shit slinging comments out
MMA,not_removed,i agree why should we not talk about politics i mean i dont care for politics but if someone wants to bring politics into the conversation let them especially in a thread that has trump in the title let downvotes and upvotes have the final say
MMA,not_removed,why is your score hidden but everyone elses are visible
MMA,not_removed,thank you
MMA,not_removed,where do you get your news
MMA,not_removed,wtf is up with this trend of locking threads stop clinging to safe spaces and dont get hung up on imaginary power
MMA,not_removed,ridiculous this is totally relevant to this sub and mma doesnt get to exist within a bubble
MMA,not_removed,i kinda love how everyone in here is critizising trump yet acts as if this is about mma just like every other sub on this site right now
MMA,not_removed,even though the title clearly says trump ban this whole article thread is about the what effect politics is having on mma but we cant talk about it lol cool coconut
MMA,not_removed,fucking hilarious
MMA,not_removed,if this new shadethrowing mousasi dropped that line in an interview the world would implode
MMA,not_removed,plot twist dana called in for a favor
MMA,not_removed,genius call on trumps part
MMA,not_removed,gegard is far more dangerous than the vast majority of people from those countries it checks out
MMA,not_removed,holy shit its actually working
MMA,not_removed,he is a bad hombre
MMA,not_removed,lol give this man gold
MMA,not_removed,big if true
MMA,not_removed,top tier comment
MMA,not_removed,fucking excellent comment
MMA,not_removed,a
MMA,not_removed,love this
MMA,not_removed,especially with someone with the name off all american
MMA,not_removed,ha well done sir
MMA,not_removed,apparantly if youre british and a dual citizen youre exempt not sure why exactly
MMA,not_removed,isnt mousasi an ethnic armenian who was born in iran
MMA,not_removed,a fellow persian from toronto im assuming by your username omidvaram khoob bashi
MMA,not_removed,this also includes randa markos shes fought her last fights in canada and is booked for halifax but shes an iraniancanadian refugee lets hope they keep bringing fights o canada well take mousasi too
MMA,not_removed,i just sent you a pm about this need some clarification
MMA,not_removed,nor did he want to no one here has read the executive order obviously since it clearly states that people like athletes and politicians are allowed in calm down children this is gonna be a looooong years let me tell ya
MMA,not_removed,all planned by the chris he knew he would have to face moose one day or another so he voted for trump s
MMA,not_removed,he did say he supports trump on helwanis show
MMA,not_removed,chris knew this would happen thats why he accepted the fight
MMA,not_removed,or you know gained citizenship
MMA,not_removed,ð
MMA,not_removed,which mind you are not the arts
MMA,not_removed,bitch cant even research her bad jokes
MMA,not_removed,much love brother hh
MMA,not_removed,dont give bisping ideas buddeh
MMA,not_removed,even fucking hulk hogan fights for the rights of every man he gets it hogan for prez
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,nah chuck norris should be a good replacement
MMA,not_removed,id watch
MMA,not_removed,im not like all the others you already punked at the primaries nah fuck that shit everyone knows the real money fight and its me
MMA,not_removed,cm punk v trump
MMA,not_removed,best one of the thread
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,whore you
MMA,not_removed,urrrr fuccin ass
MMA,not_removed,your comment makes no sense because the argument only applies to unskilled labor
MMA,not_removed,mooseshit
MMA,not_removed,boolshit
MMA,not_removed,let the moose loose
MMA,not_removed,came to say thisstripping people of their constitutional rights is one thingwhen you start fucking with the moose i wanna march
MMA,not_removed,still i lost the benefit of the doubt before he really even started but it was completely demolished once he started picking his cabinet at this point after everything he has done as president its pretty obvious he is pure corruption
MMA,not_removed,trump and dana are buddies this is a nonissue i guarantee the ufc have also shown to have extensive connections in regards to visas cerrone used to be given hell to get into canada the ufc called him to fight patrick cote short notice he said yeah but ill probably not get in ufc said lol brb
MMA,not_removed,he has a dutch passport hell be fine
MMA,not_removed,invliegverbod loosely translates to ban on flying in
MMA,not_removed,isnt he christian too not that it should matter
MMA,not_removed,newfangled american president amazing
MMA,not_removed,thanks for that whats the closest nonus event after if known
MMA,not_removed,the ring girls might have a different flair though
MMA,not_removed,gerard did i miss this meme or does moose moonlight as a brother either way is fine please advise
MMA,not_removed,its el guard mousassi gegards mexican cousin
MMA,not_removed,knowing the potus doesnt give you leeway to just circumvent law
MMA,not_removed,if they start doing case by case like this for every visitor there is no way that hiring freeze for federal work will be maintaned
MMA,not_removed,there are clauses in what trump wrote for athletes like this but since nobody reads shit before they complain here we are in this thread
MMA,not_removed,no you dont
MMA,not_removed,if he has dual citizenship he could be in some trouble and given he was born in iran he probably has dual citizenship
MMA,not_removed,they just denied an australian kid with iranian parents on his way to space camp so its not outside the realm of possibility
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure people with other passports can still be denied it will probably be deleted or changed by anyway
MMA,not_removed,people who have even less to do with their other citizenship moose would be dual dutchiranian have been denied he is boned
MMA,not_removed,its a ban on citizens from iran having a dutch passport doesnt exclude him from iranian citizenship
MMA,not_removed,he is but i believe he was born in iran and is from armenian descent so pretty much fucked with the trump ban
MMA,not_removed,i believe
MMA,not_removed,even if he has an iranian passport it doesnt matter because he can travel with his dutch one
MMA,not_removed,there is for athletes and other high profile performers and professionals but people dont mention it cuz dae trump is literally hitler durr
MMA,not_removed,he was born in iran and is of armenian descent likely holding several passports
MMA,not_removed,bisping just had surgery
MMA,not_removed,this guy says there may be issues for what thats worth
MMA,not_removed,citizens of the seven countries identified by president donald trump for a visa ban who hold dual nationality also will be barred from entering the us state department officials said saturday it also applies to people who originally hail from those countries but are traveling on a passport issued by any other nation the official said that means iraqis seeking to enter the us on a british passport for instance will be barred according to a us official british citizens dont normally require a visa to enter the us
MMA,not_removed,mousasi doesnt have citizenship in the uk
MMA,not_removed,hes not from britain hes dutch
MMA,not_removed,iceland does not get the exemption as of yet httpruvisfrettakvordunumferdabannverdurekkibreytt so far ive seen uk and australia seem to have exemptions
MMA,not_removed,i dunno about that
MMA,not_removed,well that plus hes a hardcore christian lol
MMA,not_removed,source its not in the eo
MMA,not_removed,its kinda weird how everyone magically forgot about obamas visa restrictions on iran too
MMA,not_removed,yes i did the aclu is also suing because its unconstitutional under the establishment clause
MMA,not_removed,yet another argument against trump
MMA,not_removed,i dont know why you are getting downvoted for this the executive order allows for exemptions and i dont think it would be very hard for mousasi to obtain one not necessarily because dana and trump may be friends but because mousasi shouldnt have a problem being vetted
MMA,not_removed,he has iranian citizenship so is banned
MMA,not_removed,knowing the potus doesnt just allow you to ask him to circumvent law
MMA,not_removed,there are harvard scientists affected by this why would moose not be
MMA,not_removed,it was rolled out quickly to not give bad guys a heads up to rush in and this caused a ton of confusion at the airports is that the official spin that theyre going with now lmao
MMA,not_removed,born in iran lived there till he was
MMA,not_removed,for the record i agree which is why i havent locked this thread or removed it the edit text was in response to the shillary cuck report my opinion on whether this thread should stay up or not is stated before the edit keep talkingdiscussing just keep it civil
MMA,not_removed,i agree going like trump this hillary that is not relevant that said a prominent fighter potentially being barred from competition is pertinent this news is more mousasi potentially out of ufc than hissss trump hisssss
MMA,not_removed,the words shillary cuck is just funny on its own the fact that hes being reported for it is even funnier
MMA,not_removed,talk all you want just keep it civil please
MMA,not_removed,do the total upvotes vs downvotes have the final say or is there an electoral upvote college
MMA,not_removed,mines a sticky comment
MMA,not_removed,nothing is locked
MMA,not_removed,perhaps read my comment again i havent removed or locked the thread so youre obviously fine to discuss it that said weve had to remove a ton of really shitty comments in this thread libtardneonaziosamadrumpfblah and its getting old real quick
MMA,not_removed,just tremendous
MMA,not_removed,why is this shit comment up voted
MMA,not_removed,because of our special relationship were constantly up each others arse
MMA,not_removed,that doesnt seem to be the case happened yesterday iranian born british citizen the irony is that he cant even go back to iran because he works for the bbc
MMA,not_removed,same for australia iran dual citizenship
MMA,not_removed,because it would have been very embarrassing and awkward had america turned away the likes of sir mo farah so they quickly changed it so dual citizens from good countries are allowed
MMA,not_removed,doesnt seem to be working for mo farah
MMA,not_removed,cos the us and uk have a special relationship and theresa may has not denounced trump
MMA,not_removed,yes he is definitely armenian born in iran and he holds dual citizenship in iran and netherlands but i believe being born in iran made him an iranian citizen regardless of race
MMA,not_removed,he was born in iran
MMA,not_removed,romero only further cemented weidmans fear of immigrants
MMA,not_removed,daily reminder to not get your political analysis from celebrities or pro athletes
MMA,not_removed,goddammit is there anybody that gets punched in the head for a living with an opinion i can respect anymore
MMA,not_removed,why would he need citizenship if he doesnt want to live in the us he lives in the netherlands
MMA,not_removed,you made the comment i was hoping for
MMA,not_removed,yeah she messed up her minutes of standup comedy she should stop comedy and try something else
MMA,not_removed,bidding gets to comain against yoel kos him via flying knee in the first bisping becomes the goat and is given the presidential medal of honor by trump
MMA,not_removed,your daddy
MMA,not_removed,reminds me of the oj protestors just replaced with juice
MMA,not_removed,i was cool with marginalizing nearly everyone else on the planet but this is where i draw the fucking line donald
MMA,not_removed,million moose march
MMA,not_removed,nonus citizens dont have us constitutional rights
MMA,not_removed,nah you aint going to march
MMA,not_removed,technically the ban is not completely unconstitutional if at all depending on a few interpretations
MMA,not_removed,cerrone used to be given hell to get into canada why does he have a criminal record or something
MMA,not_removed,expediting a visa and disobeying an executive order are not even in the same realm of comparable things
MMA,not_removed,i kinda wish they dont have that pulling power this time because the moose shouldve been the main event in manchester destiny is helping dana listen to it you goof
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,iran is one of those countries that doesnt allow it citizens to stop being a citizen if youre born in iran youll always be an iranian citizen and its people like moose with dual citizenship who are confused about the travel ban
MMA,not_removed,you realize thats exactly how it doesnt work right it doesnt matter what passport you hold if your birthplace is on the list
MMA,not_removed,if he has a dual citizenship he still cannot come to the country
MMA,not_removed,dial citizens are impacted as well
MMA,not_removed,nah dawg dual citizenship is a no go
MMA,not_removed,how many protesters do you think actually read the eo
MMA,not_removed,not only does mousasi have a dutch passport he will be flying from holland a country which has no problem performing the background checks which are the reason for the travel ban thats right all countries do their own background checks on passengers flying to the us and we used to just trust them even when coming from places like somalia
MMA,not_removed,lol struggled with it for like seconds until i read this is it dutch
MMA,not_removed,according to the white house it matters a great deal christians will have priority over muslims getting in this will eventually include the organ donor list ya think skipping muslims to save christians yikes
MMA,not_removed,i thought he was mooselim
MMA,not_removed,steven gerard the english moose
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,so all he has to do is scale a wall then
MMA,not_removed,a law that he implemented
MMA,not_removed,would it matter that gegard is dutch and that kid was australian serious question i still dont understand how this ban works
MMA,not_removed,thats dad for reading the headline again he will fight lol
MMA,not_removed,oh wait here it is the article says its because he has an iranian visa i think i hope this shit gets worked out
MMA,not_removed,looks like they are carving out a few different types of exemptions dual citizens being okay but upon review and case by case basis
MMA,not_removed,restrictions and banning are two separate things
MMA,not_removed,right and you know it still went through right
MMA,not_removed,my side of the shit covered coin is betar than your side of the shit covered coin
MMA,not_removed,youre trying to sensor us brah
MMA,not_removed,oh and here i thought my comment went through because gay jesus performed a miracle ffs dude if this discussion keeps heading south im afraid were going to have to lock it
MMA,not_removed,its yuuuuge
MMA,not_removed,the special relationship doesnt exist its a way for entitled brits to feel better about themselves because they are in with the winners its something youll almost always here british people say not americans ps im british
MMA,not_removed,any journalist whos a dual citizen of any of the seven countries is gonna be flying to the us at least thats what i would do gotta get that paper news
MMA,not_removed,not sure if this is true a kid got prevented from coming from aus because his parents were born in iran even tho he was born here
MMA,not_removed,but i believe being born in iran made him an iranian citizen regardless of race i think thats only the case if his father had lranian citizenship at the time or if one of his parents were born in iran regardless of their citizenship sourcei just read it on wiki may not have been indenical in the
MMA,not_removed,did bush not make it so you cannot be a dual citizen in us
MMA,not_removed,i wasnt sure that the islamic republic of iran would give an armenian christian citizenship i didnt realize he was a dual citizen until i googled his wiki
MMA,not_removed,to armenian parents in a lot of countries that would exclude you from citizenship unless they were already iranian citizens it was a fair question
MMA,not_removed,lol that makes perfect sense silly me
MMA,not_removed,this whole thread is pure gold
MMA,not_removed,especially the pro athletes that get constantly smacked in the head
MMA,not_removed,in democracies every opinion matters though yeah far from every opinion is well thought through
MMA,not_removed,yeah and he still supports trump is the thing most fighters do they are fans of hard work and not taking the easy way out
MMA,not_removed,well op was sarcastically saying oh if he really wanted to fight he should have been born in a different country im pointing out that no he could just gain citizenship and its not like this trump thing is a surprise lol people are more mad about a candidate actually keeping his campaign promises than all the rest lying about theirs
MMA,not_removed,like acting
MMA,not_removed,his wiki says hes a dutch citizen
MMA,not_removed,bang the loose moose
MMA,not_removed,basically what i was trying to say but worded better
MMA,not_removed,green card holders do i suggest you at least google things before spewing bs
MMA,not_removed,he had some boatrage head kick related assault charges not too long ago doubt he was a choir boy prior to that either but thats the most high profile cowboy shenanigans
MMA,not_removed,where did i imply disobeying an executive order at all in the slightest even a little in any reality i clearly state first line trump and dana are buddies this is a nonissue this is a nonissue this isnt even remotely a problem trump was going to go to ufc before security from winning made it impossible so his son went instead and has called dana after every major event to congratulate him there are numerous reports of people with visas getting in with vetting just your average joe muhammad and his family also athletes have an exception anyway nonissue
MMA,not_removed,the pouya ghadirian was born in australia but his parents are from iran giving him dual citizenship damn
MMA,not_removed,theyve since announced that people with dual citizenship will be able to travel there on their australian passport whether or not that is a deal specific to australia or whether someone from the netherlands like mousasi would be ok too i dont know
MMA,not_removed,mousasis parents are from armenia i dont see it affecting him but i could be wrong
MMA,not_removed,literally birthplace doesnt matter either iran lists you as a citizen if your father was born there the australian kid going to space camp who got turned away that kid was born in australia with his parents born in iran
MMA,not_removed,well im guessing all those lawyers working at the airport sure have
MMA,not_removed,if he has dual citizenship which is possible as he was born in iran this exact scenario happened in another case he still may be banned either way mousasi is hardly the sole reason to be concerned about this
MMA,not_removed,im sorry i thought real people with real lives real peace loving otherwise harmless people were being effected by an eo carried out with zero planning zero notice zero organization and zero compassion carry on though if youre just focused on the wording of the eo not actual events happening on the ground i voted for trump too btw
MMA,not_removed,thats not how visas work
MMA,not_removed,dorsntnthe religious minority thing only apply to refugees
MMA,not_removed,christian theology is compatible with the constitution yall need to read both groups books or just listen to a muslim speak to see why islam and the constitution can not vibe
MMA,not_removed,yes what he implemented is now law he cant just pick and choose who it applies to after the fact
MMA,not_removed,gegard has iranian citizenship so hes boned
MMA,not_removed,this best part of the ban and the white house is that no one knows how it works and by the best part i mean the worst
MMA,not_removed,thats literally nowhere in the headline stop trying to be edgy
MMA,not_removed,nothing in sweden yet yesterday they reported here that all swedish citizens with dual citizenship in one of those countries should not apply for a us visa in the coming days unless something changes
MMA,not_removed,i remember seeing a video clip when he was in nl with his family forgot which all i know though is that theyre armenian christians and he kisses the crucifix he got on his neck most of the time before a fight while entering the ringcage
MMA,not_removed,no one really knows how theyre treating dual citizens yet
MMA,not_removed,has my russianctrufcshill cover been blown
MMA,not_removed,chyna
MMA,not_removed,its gonna be greeeeaaat
MMA,not_removed,yuge if true
MMA,not_removed,this is rmma not squarecircled
MMA,not_removed,it definitely does saying america and us dont cooperate on a different level together is silly might not be as special as people think but were definitely on better terms with them than anyone else also were the winners in a sense of being a super power we once owned a big majority of the world and america is literally just us in a sense
MMA,not_removed,britain and america are pretty close allies
MMA,not_removed,clearly you didnt watch the devil wears prada she should have won an oscar with that performance s
MMA,not_removed,im no expert but shouldnt that be an angle he can play to circumvent the block
MMA,not_removed,doesnt matter he is simultaneously an iranian one whether he even wants to or not
MMA,not_removed,he is an armenian he was born in iran and raised in netherlands with dutch citizenshipi think so he will definitely have no problem travelling to us
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,no thank you
MMA,not_removed,its how they roll they cant have discussions like adults so they go towards hyperbole instead
MMA,not_removed,theres most definitely room to debate the letter of that particular legislation which is where most of the controversy is occurring take your own advice most things cut both ways
MMA,not_removed,boatrage head kick related assault charges im half asleep and i wish this didnt make so much sense perfect mental image ty
MMA,not_removed,im from iceland and on the news here an athlete with an icelandic passport was denied to go to usa to compete in taekwondo he was born in iran httpruvisfrettakvordunumferdabannverdurekkibreytt you can use google translate
MMA,not_removed,and the kid just wanted to to space camp
MMA,not_removed,as far as i understand a dual citizenship you cant even get rid of unless the australian part is the one youre willing to part with
MMA,not_removed,fuck you got me my edge wore off and ive been trying to get it back
MMA,not_removed,i see i see
MMA,not_removed,depends on if you agree with my political affiliation or not
MMA,not_removed,gina
MMA,not_removed,i was making a joke im not a big tvmovies guy in fact the only thing i watch is mma and a couple movies a year so i wont pretend to know about her acting capabilities
MMA,not_removed,bro he just works his sweet dutch tan dont be jel
MMA,not_removed,clearly he was going to blow up space camp as a sleepaway camp cell
MMA,not_removed,well well see how this turns out if they let mousasi in then next time the kid can say hes fighting on a ppv no problem
MMA,not_removed,he supports someone whose interest completely counter to his own people not educated to learn not to do that are dumb
MMA,not_removed,pretty sure he was also making a joke ive seen that movie thousands of times and i was not impressed with her performance
MMA,not_removed,when was the last one on this scale
MMA,not_removed,remember that movie sleepaway camp that
MMA,not_removed,do we really want to teach him how to fly stuff s idk if gegard has a work visa or a green card if its the latter he should get in easily if its the former he should get in but maybe not as easily couple hours longer possibly
MMA,not_removed,you need to work on english before politics
MMA,not_removed,yea i was making a joke im going to edit my post to add a s at the end
MMA,not_removed,ya man i saw that as a kid as well and i was shoot disturbed by the ending haha ive never spoken to someone else who saw it thats awesome its funny how watching it now its basically a comedy
MMA,not_removed,is he broken whys he just standing there
MMA,not_removed,ive not seen the movie but that spooked me somethin fierce
MMA,not_removed,i like how and are feast like comedies
MMA,not_removed,haha i always meant to watch that movie after seeing of all things although it sucks i know the ending
MMA,not_removed,lol like i said no way in hell i would know
MMA,not_removed,that thing doesnt seem that comparable not nearly as widespread comprehensive or blanket and actually in response to a tangible threat and more of a slowdown really and i wasnt talking about worldwide when i was asking about the last travel ban i meant to ask when was the last us travel ban regardless travel bans in the united states do not happen all the time thats just straight up wrong
MMA,not_removed,a clean knockout well not quite
MMA,not_removed,the one time he used his range
MMA,not_removed,yeah he also slipped pretty fucky finish
MMA,not_removed,wow i completely missed that the first time i watched this apparently so did the commentators and referee blatantly obvious though
MMA,not_removed,jones has a chance if he goes to heavyweight
MMA,not_removed,some high level dundasso
MMA,not_removed,and people say struve doesnt use every centimeter of reach to his advantage
MMA,not_removed,struve was winning this fight before this punch unfortunate that stipe slipped and got caught but its not like he was dominating the fight before this point
MMA,not_removed,would like to see miocic defend against jds and then get this w back
MMA,not_removed,ufc should come back to nottingham ill buy a ticket miocic fought really dumb here he has evolved a lot
MMA,not_removed,sometimes i feel like eye pokes are used as excuses for losses inappropriately but this one holy crow it seems like almost an almost direct cause and effect the slip seemed like it was cuz of vision issues even
MMA,not_removed,struve was battering him for at least a minute before this iirc dont like the suggestion that he won because of a poke because it isnt true
MMA,not_removed,that was a combination of unfortunate events that struve capitalized on perfectly the eyepoke clearly caused stipe some issues slipped and corrected right into a right straight to the chin rough go for stipe and solid performance by struve
MMA,not_removed,imagine struve amongst the general public in a bar or something usually when you see a giant like that you assume the odds are that he could probably kick some ass or at least give the average dumbfuck some trouble to think that he has all that size and ultra high level fighting skills is a hell of a combination
MMA,not_removed,rite rite
MMA,not_removed,did the eyepoke have poison in it or something
MMA,not_removed,love struve hate he gets hated on here a lot he seems like such a good dude when he had to pull out of the mitrione fight it was sad as fuck
MMA,not_removed,misleading title considering that struve was winning this fight before this also the whole but he slipped is as stupid as the people that say condit wouldve beaten woodley if he didnt hurt his leg theres a reason he slipped he got punched in the face
MMA,not_removed,struve was popping stipe before this dont act like struve got lucky because he got away with a foul
MMA,not_removed,dat immigrant blood
MMA,not_removed,metro pcs with the assist
MMA,not_removed,you didnt see his last fight versus omielanzcuk i almost cried that this behemoth was finally fighting long
MMA,not_removed,a rare site indeed
MMA,not_removed,a very good chance
MMA,not_removed,ive always been under the assumption hell walk right into heavyweight and become champion immediately
MMA,not_removed,but jones is a bitch who would rather fight middle aged middle weights even turned down a short notice fight against chael sonnen lol
MMA,not_removed,this is like the one time he did
MMA,not_removed,struve is really far from a title shot miocic has bigger fish to fry
MMA,not_removed,if miocic loses a title defense struve should be his warm up fight
MMA,not_removed,bisping really opened the pandora box didnt he
MMA,not_removed,nah i dont think he gives a shit about the loss really hed rather fight other people and struve is nothing rn
MMA,not_removed,he finished stipe here because of the eyepoke he was on his way to winning the fight without it but the fact that it happened taints this win
MMA,not_removed,the eyepoke clearly was intentional which then contibutedlead to to other unfortunate events he capitalised on calmly shoving his thumb in his opponents eye
MMA,not_removed,strongly disagree people shouldnt be praised for eye pokes
MMA,not_removed,condit blew out the acl on the knee that didnt get leg kicked it was a chance
MMA,not_removed,theres a reason he slipped he got punched in the face because he couldnt see the punch coming thanks to the blatant eye poke right before it
MMA,not_removed,there were no punches that landed before that slip you blind fuck
MMA,not_removed,viking
MMA,not_removed,everyones moving to metro
MMA,not_removed,he still got hit with a lot of power shots from a guy he had a inch reach advantage on
MMA,not_removed,wwwrarecom
MMA,not_removed,jones vs brock would be a good time
MMA,not_removed,its an eyepoke joke but seriously itd be interesting how hed do its not like his game at lhw translates to hw though hed have to contend with people more his size so hed have to fight different than he does currently
MMA,not_removed,and then beat his ass later only middle weights he fought were lyoto dan henderson vitor and chanel dan was the first fighter to hold belts back in pride and knocked out fedor lyoto was the light heavyweight champ of the ufc vitor was juiced to the tits and knocked out luke rockhold with a spinning kick during the same era and the chael fight is an example of how shallow the division was and still is you can talk all the shit you want jon could fuck your girlfriend and mother while holding you down with one hand
MMA,not_removed,chill dude its an eyepoke joke
MMA,not_removed,that didnt stop bisping from attempting to get his soul back from hendo
MMA,not_removed,i would love to see him fight sea level cain or ngannou or rematch werdumovereem but obviously this was a shitty way to lose with the slip and all what i meant was that i would like to see miocic get this w back somewhere down the line perhaps not immediately but yeah
MMA,not_removed,hes actually noted hes a fan of struve
MMA,not_removed,so youre not coming to my eye poke praising party jones and browne have already rsvpd as speakers in seriousness though i wasnt praising stipe for eye pokes i can see where you think that though when i did say he had a solid performance it was more so for his reaction after the slip and not the eyepoke
MMA,not_removed,we want him to use his range we dont want him to suddenly become an untouchable goat
MMA,not_removed,r u telling me he should keep pulling guard
MMA,not_removed,brock lesnar could beat up your dad
MMA,not_removed,he never fought hendo the fight was scheduled but canceled last minute chael offered to fill in but jones turned him down
MMA,not_removed,and rashad evans and shogun could probably make the cut if guys like rockhold can i do love jones but he outsized most of his opponents especially the guys he crushed
MMA,not_removed,how juiced was jon jones during the vitor fight just a regular amount or was it also to the tits
MMA,not_removed,wrong
MMA,not_removed,actually knowing hw if struve gets knockout wins i can see it happening
MMA,not_removed,hendo was a perfect storm though not that its impossible but i dont see the stars aligning for struve
MMA,not_removed,sea level cain is dead
MMA,not_removed,i do i love the skyscraper
MMA,not_removed,nah i just dont think he used he really fought long like the dude suggested i thought he let omielanzcuk get in on him too much id have liked to have seen him back out and circle when he came in more it was still nice to see him with a good jab
MMA,not_removed,ie why i dont talk shit on bork lepard you catch my fade
MMA,not_removed,rashad did fight at middleweight recently and lost looked real good physically though
MMA,not_removed,he was probably high on crack but i dont really think jones ever really used trt or anything you cant compare him to someone like vitor
MMA,not_removed,for sure work on those comebacks
MMA,not_removed,gonna have to get past ngannou first danas got a raging boner for that tall glass of french chocolate
MMA,not_removed,its tough because omielanczuk was able to follow him in as he pulled his arm or leg back from the attack struve is too big to be able to strike quickly enough to prevent that
MMA,not_removed,oh my god for struves sake i hope he doesnt fight ngannou
MMA,not_removed,as he should thats a scary dude who stops people not to mention they like international fighters and he can play well in europe and africa as he is native to cameroon but fight out of paris not that they are pushing the african market hard or anything but its always nice to have options in promoting people
MMA,not_removed,cameroonian chocolate
MMA,not_removed,ill have to watch it again but i remember a few instances where omielanczuk was able to punch his way in i could be wrong tho
MMA,not_removed,oh fuck i probably actually would not watch this big fan of struve but i couldnt sit through that
MMA,not_removed,for sure man i didnt know he was from cameroon side note i love the diversity in mma its dope having so many killers from across the globe
MMA,not_removed,ikr i love when they show some divisions rankings with the flag next to their names looks like a character select screen in street fighter
MMA,not_removed,tell that to meryll streep
MMA,not_removed,any black dude from france is going to not be very far removed from africa either first or second generation immigrant bet it
MMA,not_removed,tell her that mma fighters come from many different countries
MMA,not_removed,yeah exactly that
MMA,not_removed,this shit no god i love khabib
MMA,not_removed,too much movie make your heart weakwhat a savage
MMA,not_removed,i want to know what khabib does besides smesh in his free time
MMA,not_removed,i was surprised he knew the theme song from youve got mail and his insights regarding typical sexual tension tropes was pretty spoton despite his accent
MMA,not_removed,i dont like this
MMA,not_removed,i couldve watched minutes of this tbh
MMA,not_removed,from russia with love
MMA,not_removed,this is the greatest thing i have ever seen in my entire life
MMA,not_removed,awful music aside that was a thoroughly enjoyable video and could have gone a lot more than just examples
MMA,not_removed,now they need to have him actually watch a romcom and give his critique after actually watching it itd be really funny if one made him angry and confused and he gave more in depth reflections why this is number one boolshit
MMA,not_removed,on a serious note has he never heard of these movies do they not get those in dagestan
MMA,not_removed,that was way better than i was expecting
MMA,not_removed,lmao i do like this either khabib does not
MMA,not_removed,this is number one boolshit movie
MMA,not_removed,haha this needs to be way longer
MMA,not_removed,first video i actually lold at in awhile such a great premise wonder what other things would be amazing to have khabib comment on maybe most things
MMA,not_removed,this needs more attention
MMA,not_removed,khabib does not know love or comedy khabib knows only smesh
MMA,not_removed,lol he was totally set up with that dirty harry line that had to be scripted
MMA,not_removed,exactly what you would expect haha
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,ððð
MMA,not_removed,khabib is the type of guy to club a woman over the head and drag her back to his cozy cave with bear skins plastered all over the walls
MMA,not_removed,this man dirty harry he smash on first date fucking bool shit khabib smash on first minutes she must give up poossy i deserve this
MMA,not_removed,i dont understand why nobody kiss her hes the best
MMA,not_removed,im starting to get on his hype train after watching some of his fights on youtube the guy seems to have a brain in every limb of his body conor would lose to him so badly unless it was kept standing of course tony conor destroys i know conor is rooting for tony
MMA,not_removed,struve confirmed romcom fanatic
MMA,not_removed,khabib smesh then eat then sleep then is time for more smesh
MMA,not_removed,he plays csgo
MMA,not_removed,are you trying to bait ppl who didnt watch the video
MMA,not_removed,the terrible music honestly made the video even better it just seemed to fit so well
MMA,not_removed,if you have no interest in movies or in a particular kind of movie its pretty easy to ignore them i wouldnt say i go out of my way to ignore romcoms but i have exactly zero interest in them and have only a fleeting knowledge of the most popular ones
MMA,not_removed,im an american i listen to podcasts watch tv go to movies play video games go out with friends ie im not a shut in ive only ever heard of when harry met sally ive never heard of or seen the other two
MMA,not_removed,lets just say that i think that internet piracy is a wide spread thing outside of western world not that i would know of course the question is if he wanted to see these movies not his preferred genre i would say not could he see these movies if he wanted to you can literally watch anything you want live or recorded anywhere in the world as long as there is internet connection available
MMA,not_removed,they probably just arent on his radar im vaguely aware of two of them but i couldnt for the life of me tell you what they are about
MMA,not_removed,how many russian movies would you recognise given just the poster
MMA,not_removed,i know they got when harry met sally over there within the last couple years but those new releases they were giving him would be tough
MMA,not_removed,but khabibi kissing before marriage haram
MMA,not_removed,tony is like an improved diaz i wouldnt write him off at all
MMA,not_removed,is this the new version of if rda beats cerrone conor will stay at featherweight you people are ridiculous
MMA,not_removed,struve and dada to start their own camp netflix and chill
MMA,not_removed,haha damn the real savage right there
MMA,not_removed,pokÃ©mon go
MMA,not_removed,proof
MMA,not_removed,yeah the music made the whole thing much more comical
MMA,not_removed,yeah i couldnt give a shit about action hero comic book anime type movies so i have no idea what of reddit is talking about a lot of the time
MMA,not_removed,youve never even heard of never been kissed
MMA,not_removed,miami vice brand new show
MMA,not_removed,khabibi i see you what you did there
MMA,not_removed,httpimgurcomtejpamf
MMA,not_removed,not writing him off at all i wouldnt be surprised if he won just saying conor would rather face him over khabib
MMA,not_removed,what youre being serious
MMA,not_removed,lol wut thats one i have never heard
MMA,not_removed,that was a mental picture i didnt need yep neuron number will forever be used to hold an imagined snapshot of steven struve and dada spooning on a dirty futon in a dimly lit dorm room lit only by a lava lamp and a laptop playing napoleon dynamite
MMA,not_removed,lego
MMA,not_removed,hes russian
MMA,not_removed,he rushes b
MMA,not_removed,nope maybe it kinda rings a bell but khabib just showed me the cover i know who drew berrymore is but i certainly wouldnt have known she was in the movie i think the last drew berrymore movie i watched was the one with adam sandler where she had amnesia
MMA,not_removed,you are americans i love america
MMA,not_removed,yes were you on rmma after conor beat aldo it was common practice to say he wanted nothing to do with rda and would only fight for the lw belt if cowboy beat rda
MMA,not_removed,really because plenty of people in this sub were saying if cowboy won conor would move up but if rda won he wouldnt do it turns out he moved up to fight rda before the eventual pull out
MMA,not_removed,sickening but also undeniably hilarious
MMA,not_removed,duplo
MMA,not_removed,that movie was first dates never been kissed is about this awkward journalist who has to go back to high school for a story and gets to relive the whole experience at the end she gets her first kiss from michael vartan these are classics
MMA,not_removed,fifty shit scenes i think it was called
MMA,not_removed,the train yes its coming they are building it right now
MMA,not_removed,not as much as i should have apparently first time ive heard that conor vs khabib would be an incredible fight but if conor gets taken down even once well you saw what nate did conor has only a pretty good ground game not enough to for pro mma now tony the guys a college wrestling champ and is an entire different story i think he can make the shifts to counter being taken down all i know is i cant wait till saturday
MMA,not_removed,nobody was saying that
MMA,not_removed,nate took conor down after he hurt him on the feet khabib isnt going to try and hurt him on the feet before he takes him down i agree conor khabib is stylistic dream fight and i think it could go either way khabib certainly hasnt fought a striker on conors level and conor hasnt fought a guy who is so strong on top and able to chain takedowns and trips like khabib who the fuck knows how that fight goes down
MMA,not_removed,wanna see it happen but conor wants the money fight not that i blame him
MMA,not_removed,let the record show i just accidentally voted for woodley with full intention of picking wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,not the popular choice around here but i think woodley will win it
MMA,not_removed,im on team wonderboy but its a dangerous fight for both of them thompsons chances go up if he makes it out of the round and gradually picks tyron apart on the flipside wonderboy keeps his hands down and has shown the tendency to get hit and all it takes is one right hand from woodley
MMA,not_removed,thompson by ko thompson is the most talented striker i have seen in mma
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy all day long woodley needs to come out fast and finish it early just like tonight but wonderboy isnt going to be on the end of that big right when its thrown hell pick woodley apart at range with his kicks on the way to a finish
MMA,not_removed,i think wonder boy wins but woodly looked awesome tonight super sharp and focused and he looked great against a robbie lawler that looked to be on point tonight guys are scary good
MMA,not_removed,thompson whenever i watch him i am like damn his legs seem so long compared to his opponent
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy woodley just has that big overhand and lands it whenever he fights someone who stands in front of him and is willing to trade those big shots if you watch the rorywoodley fight you see that if they stay out of that range he doesnt have very much in regards to his striking as for his wrestling i think he uses it more to defend or to simply close the round with a td woodley also doesnt have amazing cardio to seriously push the tempo and threaten with tds round after round wonderboy is going to slowly pick him apart while just focusing on staying out of the range of the big overhand
MMA,not_removed,idk why wonderboy has an aura of inevitability that he will be a champion should be fun though
MMA,not_removed,wonderboys counters him with body shots then t wood gasses and eventually finished
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy is going to pick him apart worse than rory did hell keep him at range and go to work i expect because woodley just slept robbie rmma will immediately shift from months of saying woodley is awful and has no chance against robbie to people saying hes now going to sleep wonderboy and be a dominant champion
MMA,not_removed,same here thompson is being very overrated lately
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy is a world class undefeated kickboxer as long as he can keep the fight standing up he will always have the advantage imo
MMA,not_removed,exactly this is just the hype that comes with a new champion woodley is great but the technical strikers like rory and wonderboy just have to stay out of the that overhand right and they will pick him apart
MMA,not_removed,maybe because hes on a fight win streak beat rory easily and finished hendricks in the first round yeah very overrated
MMA,not_removed,world class kickboxer is a gross exaggeration that he has been marketed that way doesnt make him one he was competing in defunct semiamateur ikf bouts and even glory were where the elite kickboxers were competing while he was plying his craft in the noncompetitive american badlands
MMA,not_removed,okay
MMA,not_removed,new year new champs it is what it is
MMA,not_removed,and people wonder why dj is
MMA,not_removed,obviously joanna and dj are best
MMA,not_removed,was ferguson given the exact questions in advance he was pretty sharp on that mixdrink segment
MMA,not_removed,i thought it was a great interview and ferguson for the first time came off as really likable relatable and chilled the more i think about it the more i like his suggestion july fight week ferguson vs diaz for the belt pay both men a stack cause otherwise theyll wait for the conor stack and put them on as the main event for a dope card
MMA,not_removed,good to see tyron and el cucuy are cool after that little scuffle in media phone call
MMA,not_removed,any word on when khabib will fight like is his medically ok edit love tony dropping the f bomb
MMA,not_removed,id love to see tony get more of a push yeah he got drunk on tuf and screamed wheres your kid at but thats the worst controversy he has gotten himself into since hes been a ufc athlete so he sometimes makes douchey comments especially while intoxicated the dude seems like all he does is train and support his family through fighting his situation kind of reminds me of dc who gets tons of undeserved hate because people enjoyed seeing jon get the best of him in their arguments the real reason people boo dc is because he replies with corny comebacks that make people cringeat least thats why i cheered for jon in those interviews people dont want to empathize with the guy being bullied because it reminds them what its like to feel like a loser not sure how this comment got me on a dc rant but that was recently posted hit me right in the emotions anyway lets see tony on some late night talk shows and sports talk radio where he can call out khabib conor and nate simultaneously and accuse the three best lightweights in the sport that he hasnt already beaten of running from him do they want to fight the best or not
MMA,not_removed,wheres your kid has gone from complete jerk to laid back cool guy in the last years
MMA,not_removed,sucking air x
MMA,not_removed,i like this guy he can talk shit
MMA,not_removed,is it tony knows now
MMA,not_removed,spooky
MMA,not_removed,didnt he say on ariel helwanis show that he was sure khabib would make weight
MMA,not_removed,he actually has a home remodeling business as well
MMA,not_removed,ferguson is a great interview
MMA,not_removed,tony had the tiramisu laced where was eddie fight week
MMA,not_removed,im feeling tonys corporate bad guy outfit
MMA,not_removed,if khabib is scheduled to fight again and he misses weight or gets injured again the right thing for the ufc to do would be to cut him from the roster go ruin bellators events
MMA,not_removed,i thought he was reading them off the paper he picked off the table at around he seemed to look down and read before answering
MMA,not_removed,without a doubt its a friendly forum they want to showcase him not looking to hit him with an gotcha questions like in politics
MMA,not_removed,honest question did you watch the video or just listen to audio if you listened to it i can see how youd think he was sharp but he was reading every answer off the card and i got the feeling they were written for him cause he looked off screen and laughed when he did the khabib one still a good segment though i enjoyed it even if they were all written for him he still delivered them well imo
MMA,not_removed,yeah he nailed that
MMA,not_removed,he was reading the answers off his lap so i imagine so
MMA,not_removed,what did they say to each other
MMA,not_removed,hi ariel
MMA,not_removed,he has a very narrow window to still make and i mean very but that card seems to be settled on aldoholloway and gastelumsilva as the main and comain respectively and if you do khabibferguson again its gotta be a comain or main his father claims hes to start training at the end of march but ramadan is just around the corner expect him to fight in late if at all this year
MMA,not_removed,there was a rumor they wanted it in september that would line up with ramadan since it ends in late june and a camp generally takes about two months its not that long between fights but obviously khabib has a reputation and we came so close it hurts
MMA,not_removed,i dont think ferguson is anything like dc dc is actively booed the worst crowd reaction ferguson has had is a bit of silence hes a pretty easy fighter to cheer for based on his actionstyle and i doubt he has a following of vocal haters the way dc or woodley seem to have
MMA,not_removed,i dont think people boo dc because of his personality its because hes prone to wrestle fucking ppl in the main event
MMA,not_removed,ufc shows are actually some of the only sports shows i can stand to watch they have a good roster of analysts who know what they are talking about and they actually cover their sport instead of just showing child cancer stories and shit like espn
MMA,not_removed,i dont like how the ufc is taking over the mma media theyve been slowly displacing independent media sources with big budget shows that have better access to fighters a bigger reach with a network deal and a more impressive format to make the parties seem like amateurs they have state run media in magazines websites fightland is ufcvice though seem to be hands off so far tv shows bye bye espns mma live mma uncensored and inside mma and now they have their own podcast who always get the big names on fight week ariel used to be backstage with a camera interviewing fighters minutes after their fight now thats exclusive ufc content and no media has access backstage ariel was known for those interviews long before his podcast blew up they have such a huge advantage over parties like mmajunkie mmafighting and sherdog with their network tv presence budget and the fact that fighters will naturally appease the will of the guys signing their checks not sure why media guys dont discuss this the ufc is literally taking the raw resources needed for many of them to do their jobs and giving them to people on their payroll
MMA,not_removed,this sub would explode if khabib were cut
MMA,not_removed,please tell me youre theboxingczar on instagram
MMA,not_removed,lol i see the palin mccain talking point worked on you
MMA,not_removed,ferguson answered a media question and said that he was the real main event of and should be headlining the card and woodley quickly replied that hes the champ and thats why hes the main event i dont remember it going any further than that
MMA,not_removed,totally forgot about ramadan and how it effects khabibs training feels like an eternity between khabib fights between missing weight injuries and time off for religious purposes nothing wrong with that gotta respect it i just wanna see the dude fight these other top guys
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats true i guess i read too many threads about him on rmma and i am more referring to his perception among fans not active booing at events the last card its hard to tell because i thought i remembered some booing but it was probably just the vocal russian and muslim contingents that seem to follow khabib wherever he goes i agree that ferguson does have a much better reputation with fans than dc or woodley
MMA,not_removed,ok guess were all then
MMA,not_removed,just wait until he loses that first bellator fight kevin lee would beat khabib
MMA,not_removed,gsp vs khabib would watch the fuck out of that fight
MMA,not_removed,thats right and in weeks time i am going to be face to face with the hero of rmma conor mcgregor if conor wants to be a boxer he needs to fight young lions not old retired former greats why doesnt conor call out me keith thurman or canelo you know why too young too skilled
MMA,not_removed,its funny cause its one of those rare times where i am in agreement with both fighters khabib vs ferguson was the main event for me but theres no way an interim fight should top a legit title fight go figure
MMA,not_removed,didnt tony also say something like he won tuf at implying he could fightbeat tyron
MMA,not_removed,can i be too sucks
MMA,not_removed,you want some waffle fries with that salt
MMA,not_removed,i saw you on paddy pimbletts instagram and i must say you are a master craftsman of trolling
MMA,not_removed,damn dude i never knew if you were a troll or not but apparently you really are delusional do you have any fights that dont take place in your garage who have you beaten what makes you think you could take conor or that youre in the same league as canelo or thurman
MMA,not_removed,but theres no way an interim fight should top a legit title fight ufc would like to have a word
MMA,not_removed,in the early zuffa days they had non title fights headline ufc tito vs vitor headlined over the hw championship between arlovski and sylvia
MMA,not_removed,and ufc which is even more egregious a bout over a title fight
MMA,not_removed,i mean a lot of their big signings have been recent and havent come to fruition yet im willing to give them a chance to see if their cards get better i think giving the ufc competition will be good for the fans in the long run
MMA,not_removed,theres economic factors they have to provide a certain amount of content for spike each year remember when they did two cards in two days ufc has done that in one day thats to try and clear up owed events to broadcasters these smaller bellator cards have a lot of no namers from the local area of event event itself is lower budget too if it made financial sense to have super stacked cards a year and nothing else they would do that rizinksw are doing well on that less is more schedule but it doesnt work for all
MMA,not_removed,bellator wont get moved to a different network theyre owned by viacom who also owns spike none of their other channels really make sense
MMA,not_removed,went to bammabellator event in dublins arena the bamma part of the card was much more professional and organised having the bellator card after this was a real anticlimax the main event was a flop and most people left the arena before it was over bamma hosting another event soon in dublin and will be trying to go far better and more organised imo
MMA,not_removed,this is what ive been saying since the beginning a lot of bandwaggoners on this sub are claiming bellator is doing so great right now if youve paid any attention to bellators management as well as cokers management of strikeforce that shine will start to wear off pretty quickly lets not forget the three best bellator fighters ever brooks alvarez and askren all left the organization with the title and they were all dying to leave bellator due to the poor management and lack of professionalism
MMA,not_removed,this chaelwandy card would be an absolutely bonkers free tv card but the fact thats its on ppv makes it meh
MMA,not_removed,yeah theyre nowhere close to ufc and i usually dont even watch their events
MMA,not_removed,you can say the same things about the ufc a majority of their events are subpar as well especially these days
MMA,not_removed,this plus bellator still needs to give other fighters fights and try to promote them tbh thir last couple events have been good
MMA,not_removed,its almost like people forgot kimbo v dada was year ago bellator is light years away from being an actual competitor to the ufc and youre kidding yourself if chael larkin rory or benson are changing that anytime soon
MMA,not_removed,but a subpar ufc event is better than a subpar bellator event by leaps and bounds
MMA,not_removed,was probably better than of bellator events
MMA,not_removed,i would have to disagree there the last two fight nights and the last ppv all turned out to be pretty awesome was the last all around stinker i can think about in a long time the chael v ortiz event sucked dick only highlight was ward getting a daley knee to the eye socket
MMA,not_removed,its almost like you people forget that cm punk fought in the ufc less than a year ago
MMA,not_removed,exactly not even comparable the weakest ufc fight cards are still designed on a basic level with some semblance of matchmaking rankings and prospectcontender intention in mind you cant always say the same thing about bellator some of their matchmaking decisions make sense and the high turnover rate of their champions is equally concerning
MMA,not_removed,not always true in terms of pure entertainment value bellator put out some bangers
MMA,not_removed,probably as in you dont know
MMA,not_removed,on a card headlined by the reem v stipe and travis v werdum when the ufc headlines a card with matt hughes and royce gracie ill be worried
MMA,not_removed,right cm punk fighting on a great card headlined by overeem vs stipe is so much worse than kimbo vs dada kimbo vs shamrock and royce vs shamrock right i love youre posts in this thread trying to compare gsp vs bisping to kimbo vs dada kimbo vs shamrock gracie vs shamrock and doing it with a straight face of course if the ufc headlined a card with any of those fights or chael vs wandy you would be in here shitting on them
MMA,not_removed,yeah artem lobov vs cub swanson and gsp vs michael bisping make all the sense in the world
MMA,not_removed,ya of course it depends on how the fights go im saying just looking at the names and matchups on a card lower quality ufc cards are almost always way stronger than bellators smaller cards
MMA,not_removed,probably as in everytime i watch bellator its a shit show
MMA,not_removed,matt hughes and royce gracie they did i watched it live
MMA,not_removed,im not praising what bellator are doing either im just saying ufc isnt that fucking innocent
MMA,not_removed,but these are two egregious and very very recent examples historically bellator making terrible decisions is just par for the course
MMA,not_removed,name value wise of course it is ufc is the biggest organisation in the world and have been around for over decades nobody when theyre becoming a professional mma fighter is gonna say my dream is to fight in bellator its always i wanted to be a ufc fighter
MMA,not_removed,i love that youre getting downvoted the ufc hate circlejerk will never cease to amaze me people that have never watched bellator before chael vs tito are in for quite a treat if they think the ufcs matchmaking is bad btw can you imagine if the ufc tried to headline a ppv with chael vs wandy and the corpse of fedor vs mitrione
MMA,not_removed,hey remember when james toney fought in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,btw can you imagine if the ufc tried to headline a ppv with chael vs wandy and the corpse of fedor vs mitrione im more excited for chael vs wandy and the corpse of fedor vs mitrione than watching bisping struggle against the corpse of dan henderson
MMA,not_removed,thank god someone agrees
MMA,not_removed,wtf is bubble
MMA,not_removed,just want to say i love your style always gracious in defeat and humble in victory interviews im sure you should have gotten the win over miller in your second to last fight
MMA,not_removed,hey joe if you could fight a food item which one would you fight i would fight an onion
MMA,not_removed,hey joe
MMA,not_removed,i know this isnt an ama or anything but i cant get on bubble to ask i started bjj recently trying to move to less time in front of video games it sounds like it is similar to your first steps as well im having a hell of a time staying motivated to go even though i am enjoying when i make it do you have any advice to help stay motivated to keep my fat ass at the gym
MMA,not_removed,hey joe how was your day
MMA,not_removed,joe in your opinion what is stopping the ufc from picking up the mangler
MMA,not_removed,youre the man joe
MMA,not_removed,im going to see my first live mma event in nashville in a few weeks and the biggest reason im excited is to see ujoelauzondotcom fight i cant wait
MMA,not_removed,is it bubble or bumble
MMA,not_removed,not sure if youll respond since im late but i have a question joe i was getting ready for my amateur debut on the this month but had to pull out cause i popped a rib in jiu jitsu so no training for a little bit now im and i already have a few nagging injuries but worried im losing time because ive become so injury prone lately did you have any of these problems when you started out

MMA,not_removed,its called bumble its basically tinder but they make it so only the woman can make the first message and if they dont do it within the match expires or if the dude doesnt reply to that message within it also expires meaning you are unmatched so cannot communicate it actually runs smoother than tinder for me and crashes less the only problems are the smaller userbase and the fact that it seems most women are used to men initiating conversation so you just get of hey or hi messages
MMA,not_removed,cuz he gets paid

MMA,not_removed,same thing
MMA,not_removed,more like rear naked poke
MMA,not_removed,its obvious this will save some money by not paying anik stann the models and production staff but it feels like this is taking a few steps backwards in terms of hyping fights especially with a watered down card no weigh in no face offs no hype videos and interviews great job ufc
MMA,not_removed,as a fan living in new orleans where we only get fight nights i hate this
MMA,not_removed,no ceremonial weigh ins no gems like mike perry
MMA,not_removed,they already did this for albany card in december its a right move for smaller cards why waste anybodys time when there are going to be people in the crowd for fake weigh ins
MMA,not_removed,media turn out for small events has been less during the past few months also in the us
MMA,not_removed,this sucks ive been watching since and i always watch the weighins to get hyped for the fights
MMA,not_removed,its on during super bowl weekend its not worth renting out a building for an event that ist going to draw a lot of people renting a building that weekend is probably going to cost more than what the gate will end up being also at some point you are either interested in this card or not seeing two guys stand and do their best mean face for seconds isnt going to convince people to stay up till on a saturday night especially with the fucking super bowl on the next night
MMA,not_removed,fight main card on get ready to stay up until est
MMA,not_removed,are these new owners penny pinchers or something
MMA,not_removed,they should merge the ceremonial weigh in with the real one at like noon and thats it
MMA,not_removed,i think its this because of all the events going on in downtown houston right now nfl experience concerts and tons of other things for the super bowl
MMA,not_removed,damn not a fan of this decision if they go this way from now on there has been so many great moments on the weighin stage i like to use them as a tool for betting as well to see who looks like theyve had a bad cut etc
MMA,not_removed,dont forget a giant reason for this for the smaller shows when they host ceremonial weighins its typically at the host venue if not then its at a venue that needs to be rented out regardless any idea what it costs to book united center in chicago for a few hours in the afternoon if its not available or you want to go smaller any idea what it costs to book chicago theatre on state street i dont know the exact numbers but it cant be cheap on top of that you have to pay your stage crew you have to pay your production crew for a broadcast im sure there are fees that are due commission members who would need to be in attendance there almost certainly is extra insurance that needs to be paid there are the transportation fees just to get the fighters from the hotel to the venue and back and countless things im not even thinking about and for what for a broadcast on that probably doesnt do squat for ratings unless you have a giant name and for a couple hundred fans on a good day to be there in person theyre not making that money back in the advertising on theyre not making it back in concessions and merchandise sales at the venue basically it was a pr move and a goodwill thing for the fans theres little doubt that the internal conversation came up with something along the juice isnt worth the squeeze lines for the smaller shows and im not sure i can fault them
MMA,not_removed,not a horrible idea some of these small events have only a handful of media at them the same media that showed up for the real weight in
MMA,not_removed,i think we are starting to see the ufc appeal to a more casual audience most casual fans dont watch or even care about the weighins the golden age of mma is coming to an end fellas its all about appealing to masses than the hardcore fans when it comes to making the big
MMA,not_removed,not sure if its related but i noticed at ufc phoenix fight night they did not have programs either just a sided sheet with bouts listed even the smaller fight nights used to have programs now they might not even do that they dont need the large oversize programs like they used to but they need something that gives more information on the fights fighters the ufc etc thoughts
MMA,not_removed,i completely forgot that card with derrick lewis vs some guy was happening because they didnt do a ceremonial weighin making a bit of a show out of weighins has been a part of combat sports for a very long time so to cut that of all things doesnt make much sense to me its easy promotion it gives bettersfans a sense of how inshape fighters are etc
MMA,not_removed,another big reason they arent doing it is because is going to be doing wall to wall super bowl coverage stuff this week and they arent goign to take a break from that to go to an hour long show filled with very few famous fighters
MMA,not_removed,with grasso vs herrig my god this is a travesty
MMA,not_removed,if ceremonial weighins werent so fucking boring and had more hype around it maybe more people would show up this sucks
MMA,not_removed,they gotta make a return on that investment somehow lol
MMA,not_removed,if korean zombie is on a card i will watch it i was of that bought aldo vs kz the combat world stops and watches when he fights he needs better promotion for the rest of the markets if you show somebody a kz fight they will become a fan
MMA,not_removed,no big deal we all know who diddidnt make weight ceremonial weighins are nothing more a fashion show featuring reebok apparel and fit bodies in underwear
MMA,not_removed,i doubt the ufc is just abandoning their hypegeneration efforts for smaller events theyre probably just adjusting the way they implement it if you think about it all of the things that televised weighins accomplished can easily be done elsewhere there are tons of opportunities to do interviews with fighters they end up on various social media sites and on some of their fox programming they have plenty of avenues to deliver interviews to their viewers announcing who diddidnt make weight is completely unnecessary fans either dont care or they find out on twitterredditfacebook long before the ceremonial weighins go live by hype videos im guessing you just mean any kind of video advertising again theres a ton of different ways for the ufc to get that kind of stuff out there theres no reason it needs to be at a weighin the faceoffs are probably the biggest thing theyd lose but it seems they have plenty of opportunities to set up facetoface confrontations before a fight takes place so i dont see that as being an irreplaceable thing my guess is that the ufc has been going over their viewership numbers remember they have access to that information and you do not and found out that barely anyone actually watches these things anymore sure people tune in to watch ronda and conor weighing in but for the smaller shows people just werent watching anymore instead they watched the various clips from the weighins that always end up on youtube eg the video of two fighters facing off the video of a fighter being interviewed etc then someone had a bright idea instead of making a program that nobody wants to watch how about we just directly produce the minutes of content that people actually care about split it up into various videos for more convenient viewing and then post it on all of the social media that everyone is already on
MMA,not_removed,i feel like when they do have weigh ins it will feel more special
MMA,not_removed,there is no way they would be doing a ceremonial weighin in the same city the night before the super bowl they would be wasting their time and money
MMA,not_removed,it was a good guess that the ceremonial weigh under would go away as soon as the tv deal was up is this a result of a new tv deal m
MMA,not_removed,which is nuts because its such a large city and you guys are so welcoming to tourist bucks it makes no sense to not do a ppv there at least every years i remember the last time your city hosted a super bowl the commentators were talking about how they would be content doing every super bowl there because of the food music and environment in general bring in some southerners country boys like porrier cowboy rumble big country and derrick lewis add to that a stellar main event and it would be a sold out dome
MMA,not_removed,so true the dude has a sizable online presence purely because that scream meme went viral in the community you lose that kinda publicity without the platform of the weigh ins
MMA,not_removed,you say why waste anyones time because the crowd might be small i say why generate interest in fights that have very little to begin with if i dont know who a fighter is i am less apt to watch them or get excited about their fight but when i hear brian stann tell me an undercard fighter has first round stops i get excited and make a point to see their fight as cliche as this sounds my interest in ufc is directly attributed to the jre at first i was disinterested in hearing him talk about fights and fighters maybe even mildly annoyed but after months and months of him speaking so highly of fighters and incredible fights especially the women i decided to watch my first event rousey mcmann its not about the live audience size its about getting fans hyped for someone other than conor mcgregor or ronda rousey i dont consider myself a hardcore fan but im not exactly a casual fan either im sure im not the only one who gets interested in fights or specific fighters because of the prefight hype around the ceremonial weigh ins
MMA,not_removed,tell that to those people who were excited to be there
MMA,not_removed,so lets cancel it altogether to hell with hyping unknown undercard fighters something like that i would assume that the list of what fans watch goes something like this fights weighins tuf embedded vlogs daddy danas lukin fer a fight open workouts ive gotten so excited for undercard fights because i learned about a fighter at the weighins that im probably a fan of as many fighters than if i just watched the events without the weigh ins
MMA,not_removed,so the open workouts are in a field somewhere seems they have the space and are prepared to pay staff for the workouts would you prefer the workouts over weigh ins edit i didnt realize they are on thursday i dont watch the open workouts i just figured they were the same day as weigh ins
MMA,not_removed,well just call it revenge for me having to make business calls to the east coast by pacific
MMA,not_removed,worse they are business men who dont give a fuck about mma or the fighters this is another asset in their portfolio and it better preform
MMA,not_removed,the issue with that is there is a window several hours long in which fighters can weigh in so they would have to just sit around from the time they make weight until the end of that window either way they need to get the shit figured out for a multi billion dollar corporation who just sold for more than any other sports organization in the history of sports this is some real amateur hour shit
MMA,not_removed,yeah zuffa didnt care about money
MMA,not_removed,they didnt have them at their atlantic city events in either
MMA,not_removed,derrick lewis vs some guy or as rampage would say roy nelson vs
MMA,not_removed,i didnt even know they aired the weigh ins on i always watch them online it makes sense because they have all the fox stuff when its an card but maybe they should have just done it online like they do for ppvs
MMA,not_removed,i agree to a point i think they should either do away with the weigh in part and make it walkouts a little fighter background from the commentators shit talking and faceoffs or at least weigh them in again but stepping on a scale for half a second is bullshit i also found myself losing interest when they started skipping weeks just to show full cards in one day could they really not show an overseas card on one of those off weeks im not watching hours of fights more like hours of fights and hours of commercials in one day and when i skip an event i almost always get the results spoiled before i can watch
MMA,not_removed,cutting cost on promotion that helps sell the fight is probably not a good idea but what the fuck would i know im just a goof talking shit on the internet
MMA,not_removed,i feel the same about ujoelauzondotcom i know hes showing up with a pocket full of balls and hes going to throw down until the fight is over some fighters are mustwatch kz is definitely one of them
MMA,not_removed,which creates hype which is his point
MMA,not_removed,i love hearing the back story and seeing the face offs for unknown fighters on the prelims it gets me interested and puts a name out there for me to root for ive been following several fighters since thanks to the ceremonial weigh ins its not like the ufc is desperate for money i dont understand this decision
MMA,not_removed,fit bodies in underwear whywewatch
MMA,not_removed,i love them seeing guys face off before they meet in the octagon is great and you always get interesting fighter profiles from whoever is at the desk
MMA,not_removed,first time i went was fight night i think where ellenberger murked shields which was held in the convention center the second time was fight night nola which was and amazing card but it was held in the smoothie king where the pelicans play i wish they would do a super event ppv in the seat super dome it will never hapoen though
MMA,not_removed,they have a lot of pre fight promotional material outside of the fake public weigh ins and as a company that runs promotional events they obviously have an interest in which are and are not worth putting on
MMA,not_removed,yeah honestly no one gives a shit about open workouts
MMA,not_removed,this is some real amateur hour shit no its actually pro shit theyre testing it on smaller cards so that theyll have actual numbers to see if the ceremonial weigh ins actually increase revenue
MMA,not_removed,weird being atlantic city is such a gaming friendly place
MMA,not_removed,that may be true but they wont know till they test it out it doesnt hurt to do some pilots on small cards
MMA,not_removed,well it is a card so from a purely short term perspective there is probably little in net profit that having a weigh in would have in terms of increasing revenue for that fight whereas there probably is an associated cost of some tens of thousands of dollars in showing it the hype is kinda intangible that a corporation seeking to recoup its investment would probably overlook in favor of a short term cost savings but a ppv card i would see them airing them because some kind of wild confrontation may just be the tipping point in getting some people to go out and buy the ppv
MMA,not_removed,but its not a ppv and they might have data showing ticket buy rates priorpost the stated media events if they have to use to bring in an extra then it wouldnt be worth it
MMA,not_removed,especially when they face off nothing gets me hyped seeing fighters facing off during the weigh ins and see the close up from danas camera guy
MMA,not_removed,to add to this half the fighters are people ive never seen before until the weigh ins edit for the dumbasses the think im dissing the promos why would i think its a bad thing to be introduced to the fighters
MMA,not_removed,its like the new owners want to trim the fat to pinch every penny possible but they are cutting weight all wrong and burning muscle instead heres another brilliant idea lets fire goldie and replace him with jim rome or jon anik granted goldie was pretty much a soundboard with a handful of sponsor plugs i just wish they would replace him with someone who would actually be an improvement like leslie smith or miesha tate if you are going to replace a decade long mainstay to the crew maybe do it with someone who isnt going to cheapen the show we already hear enough or aniks enthusiasmless voice now we have to hear that for the ppv cards maybe we can replace rogan with morgan freeman while were at it i hear meryl streep has been takling about mma maybe she can join the crew too
MMA,not_removed,which is brilliant considering kz who hasnt fought in almost years is headlining
MMA,not_removed,so youre saying theyre introducing you to the fighters who are going to be fighting tomorrow and thats a bad thing
MMA,not_removed,so when you watch the fight youve seen the person twice and heard their name multiple times thats called promotion
MMA,not_removed,leslie smith am i missing something why would leslie smith be good at commentary google doesnt show that shes ever done it or really any reason to believe shed be any good at it just seems like a weird name to throw out there miesha makes sense leslie smith doesnt
MMA,not_removed,i dont know if either leslie or miesha is a good fit for the role idealy you want a pro who can keep the broadcast on schedule and provide play by play in the dead space where rogan has nothing to say and of course cram in the ten sl thousand ads the company sells for each show
MMA,not_removed,miesha is definitely more polished for the job but im basing this off invicta i think it was where smith filled in for the broadcast staff she is amazingly articulate always down to fight and a good ambassador for the sport either way i think a female fighter would be a good addition to play off of rogan
MMA,not_removed,ah i didnt know about the invicta commentary thanks a lot google
MMA,not_removed,leslie did incage interviews not analysis or commentary
MMA,not_removed,thats cool but she could have got you an interim title
MMA,not_removed,cool as fuck dj really is a cool guy man
MMA,not_removed,thats awesome im already a mightymouse fan but ill also be cheering for kevin casey in his next fight for the simple fact that hed take time out of his day to do that for a fan by the way what did your girlfriend get you
MMA,not_removed,she messaged some of my favourite ufc fighters she also messaged kevin casey which was super random ayyyy poor old kev
MMA,not_removed,im a fan of dj simply for two clips he genuinely seems like hed be fun to hang out play some game with
MMA,not_removed,its a shame you couldnt get a hold of platinum thought you wouldnt age boi aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
MMA,not_removed,did kevin casey say many more to come or maybe more to come because one of them is normal and the other combined with an ominous well see is very worrisome kc is coming for you dude
MMA,not_removed,happy birthday ashton homo is a good one

MMA,not_removed,that is so cool happy late birthday mate also props to mighty mouse for taking the time to do something like that for a fan just days from a title defence that says a lot about the guy and the same goes for horiguchi and casey
MMA,not_removed,i mean its pretty cool that you got a response from dj but id be even happier that you have such a great gf kudos to you

MMA,not_removed,i have to admit to warming to dj slowly but he is an amazing fighter every time i seeread an interview with him he comes off as a great guy then he does stuff like this even cooler
MMA,not_removed,great now million people will send dj birthday requests regardless happy belated birthday ashton hope its a good one
MMA,not_removed,i love dj when he streams on twitch hes pretty interactive with the chat hes just a nice and chill guy

MMA,not_removed,she is most definitely a keeper put a ring on that one because thats one hell of a birthday gift
MMA,not_removed,haha i still have a video on twitch when me and mighty mouse had a conversation about the fight that was on that night i think it was the dom and tj fight
MMA,not_removed,i thought you were going to say the surprise was a red panty night i am disappoint
MMA,not_removed,vid made me giddy happy birthday
MMA,not_removed,nice i got chills just imagining that was me getting wished happy birthday
MMA,not_removed,aslong as none of them replied with a dick pic its all good lol all jokes aside happy birthday op

MMA,not_removed,so likely the best fighter yes i said it in the world wishes you a happy birthdaydude thats awesome
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse streams on twitch dude is legit
MMA,not_removed,was i the only one expecting some sort of nsfw situation with the title
MMA,not_removed,very cool its not too surprising though that he would do something like that he is a very down to earth guy i watch him on twitch when ever i get a chance and he is always very cool and talkative with fans plays a lot of cool games too so follow him on twitch and watch sometime twitch channel
MMA,not_removed,thats awesome
MMA,not_removed,very very cool mighty mouse might just be the goat and im gonna have to cheer for kevin casey the next time he fights
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse is awesome his streams are quite chill too
MMA,not_removed,wait wait what dj is defending his title in less than a week are you sure about that
MMA,not_removed,dj is such a chill cool dude stuff like this makes it sort of disappointing he hasnt made that superstar leap yet and hes forced to constantly deal with this why not him narrative i think demetrius johnson and tyron woodley could take thing from conor to really help get over with fans if theyd just slow down when they talk sometimes emphasize some things some more take some extra time to think while talking rather than rushing to get the last thought out notice how conor used to speak at press conferences he would sit and ponder his response a moment say emphatically and place the mic down on the table putting the mic down as if he was resisting the temptation to say anymore than needed to be said heres hoping for the mega breakthrough in
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse seems more and more like a good dude oh and happy belated birthday from this unknown unaccomplished fighter as well haha
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse is the man
MMA,not_removed,amazing he doesnt get enough credit for being so down to earth
MMA,not_removed,i was hammered after and spent like on twitch so that i could ask mm questions and have him read my user name no regrets
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse pound for pound nicest guy
MMA,not_removed,came in expecting with arianny
MMA,not_removed,read the title and was looking forward to this thread noticed there was no nsfw tag and got that sinking feeling opened the thread and realized some guys have different birthday wishes
MMA,not_removed,i get a little giddy if he replies to my messages on twitch chatwould probably feint if he sent me a birthday vid nice dude
MMA,not_removed,despite everything that was a really nice gesture from kevin casey
MMA,not_removed,thats awesome
MMA,not_removed,kevin casey seems like such a good dude same with mighty mouse
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse is the man you follow that guy in twitter or twitch and just come to find out the guy is cool as fuck such a great fighter so down to earth and humble shame he doesnt get the love he deserves but mighty mouse is truly awesome
MMA,not_removed,that was awesome dj is hilarious he just created a big fan out of me enojy your bday man and oh you should put a ring on on her bc she seems like she definitly deserves it
MMA,not_removed,thats honestly really fucking cool i love seeing fighter fan interaction on all levels fighters are like the only stars i get nervous to meet but i just respect them so much i feel like that wrestling fan its still real to me dammit
MMA,not_removed,wow thats really cool of dj and kevin to do that and cool of your gf for thinking about it and youre probably cool with such a nice gf and all everyones cool i feel good
MMA,not_removed,mm is a cool ass dude hes always answering questions and chatting with people on his twitch stream while hes gaming
MMA,not_removed,thats fucking awesome
MMA,not_removed,mighty mouse coolest guy in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,mm is the absolute man i remember one of the few times i even used twitch i went to his stream and shot him a question he responded almost instantly and gave a thoughtful response made me a fan for life
MMA,not_removed,everything ive heard about dj im not surprisedmotherfuckers he seems like a really nice guy
MMA,not_removed,might mouse besides being the pound for pound best is also one of the pound for pound coolest dudes out there the guy is completely underrated i talked with him on twitch and it blew my mind how down to earth he is i still dont get how he isnt a fan favorite at this point i mean he is literally sitting at press converences not getting any questions
MMA,not_removed,wow a threesome with mighty mouse lucky you
MMA,not_removed,teenage mutant ninja turtle pies
MMA,not_removed,dont they charge money for these kind of videos pretty sure a lot of fighters do it
MMA,not_removed,hangs out in his twitch stream at quite often cool guy he and rampage streams quite often rampage at httpswwwtwitchtvrampageishuman
MMA,not_removed,i would have preferred head
MMA,not_removed,happy belated man thats a really cool of your girlfriend to do that many returns
MMA,not_removed,of all fighters why on earth would she message kevin fucking casey am i missing something lol
MMA,not_removed,youre so lucky you get to bang meg from family guy
MMA,not_removed,happy belated birthday you obviously have a fairly hot gf going to go out on a limb since she got so many responses and you got to get a birthday message from the master so that must have been one hell of a day for you
MMA,not_removed,a
MMA,not_removed,why u a fan of kevin casey

MMA,not_removed,i guess op wouldve to settle for just the rim
MMA,not_removed,this meme is gold
MMA,not_removed,got mine in a cracker jack box
MMA,not_removed,yeah i wasnt still not sure about posting this because they probably dont want their inbox filled with happy birthday requests but i wanted people to see what a genuinely nice guy he is
MMA,not_removed,such a great personality should watch him play video games on twitch ill drop the link below he talks a lot to his fans and answers so many questions while entertaining in another manner the guy is a great role model
MMA,not_removed,dj has the perfect life man living like an athlete gets paid to do what he loves seems to have a good wife and family and plays video games in his free time thats like as good as it gets man lol
MMA,not_removed,dude she felt so bad and embarassed when i told her that kevin casey got cut recently because apparently her message was saying about how i was a huge fan of the ufc etc but he was still so cool nice enough to reply with a genuinely awesome video she wrote me an amazing song she was working on for the past two months and made a beautiful video to go with it thanks for asking
MMA,not_removed,kevin casey seems like he doesnt fight to his strengths he supposedly has an extensive jiujitsu background but ive only seen him lay and pray or ground and pound still really cool of him hes obviously getting overlooked but im rooting for him in bellator
MMA,not_removed,unnecessary burn
MMA,not_removed,op is fucking heartless geez haha
MMA,not_removed,thought one of those were links was going to be the scene where his wife says she left something on the nightstand and he gives that goofy look to the camera dj is the man
MMA,not_removed,im a fan of dj simply for two clips dont forget this one httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcejyutpkvoa
MMA,not_removed,any idea what his coach was wearingplaying in that second clip
MMA,not_removed,oh hey i was at that same sheraton hotel last night

MMA,not_removed,show some respect thats alis son in law
MMA,not_removed,hahahaha dude ill willingly admit how giddy and excited i got over this was pathetic but you can at least appreciate them for the fact that it was a genuinely nice gesture that they didnt have to do
MMA,not_removed,whats pathetic is taking yourself so damn seriously you wouldnt even crack a grin if mm wished you happy birthday
MMA,not_removed,what why wouldnt it be exciting to see a personalized message from one of the best martial artists in history its the same as appreciating an athlete in any sport or even any movie star different people have different interests theres nothing wrong or unmanly with being humbled by the accomplishments of others
MMA,not_removed,gonna need a fookin army to get dat interim belt off me yeh
MMA,not_removed,you could have maybe made her weight lower isnt too flattering
MMA,not_removed,hes a really cool guy i got him through the oryx raid from destiny around this time last year he was really good when you gave him the instructions of what to do even though he was under leveled
MMA,not_removed,honor your account bet
MMA,not_removed,god damn you got a keeper
MMA,not_removed,for the lazy
MMA,not_removed,haha i was like i bet one of those are with his wife and the nightstand platinum scene
MMA,not_removed,heres my favorite
MMA,not_removed,im just talking about in the context of the video he seems really hyped about birthdays from all ive seen of him hes super chill
MMA,not_removed,link for curious
MMA,not_removed,op you have to deliver and post the video now
MMA,not_removed,are you fucking serious brah i had no idea he was fighting the winner that night thats awesome

MMA,not_removed,uleclassman is chicken he run all year fight me uleclassman
MMA,not_removed,hey uleclassman uncle dana here we had another event fall through so if we could have that interim belt back thatd be greeeeeaaaattt

MMA,not_removed,yeah i run his wow guild heading to his fight on sautrday and meeting him at his after party hes a great dude
MMA,not_removed,really haha thats so dope guardian
MMA,not_removed,lol i watched that o twitch i played lots of destiny til ttk and it was awesome to see him genuinely into it even tho the mechanics of the raid are the hardest by far imo the dude always answers question and stuff on his twitch channel awesome dude
MMA,not_removed,a bj wouldnt have gone amiss though
MMA,not_removed,thanks man i couldnt remember what embedded it was in or i would have linked it myself
MMA,not_removed,he starts off the video looking like mac from its always sunny
MMA,not_removed,yeah man nothing like a free championship fight
MMA,not_removed,yeah be a man dont get excited about anything ever
MMA,not_removed,a
MMA,not_removed,thought youd get away from bullshit on rmma boiiiiii aaaaaaaaaghhhhhhh
MMA,not_removed,thats maybe the greatest line in the history of mma
MMA,not_removed,im gonna smash ur son
MMA,not_removed,uleclassman smash minute no problem welcome
MMA,not_removed,khabib talking smack to dana is so fucking funny between rounds that too
MMA,not_removed,this is the outcome i was seriously hoping for sounds like he would do that
MMA,not_removed,his psn
MMA,not_removed,sounds like a crazy set of events lucky for you
MMA,not_removed,that is awesome i have heard hes an awesome and chill guy i dont play wow but used to play everquest and was an officer in a raiding guild in our guild was a guy who was a onehitwonder musician in the
MMA,not_removed,yeah i even have a screenshot of us after we finished somewhere on the internet edit httpsimgurcomadimgq
MMA,not_removed,oh hes such a great guy i did a write up of the entire event and posted it on the destiny subreddit someone actually tweeted it to him and he retweeted it saying something like what goes down with the mighty squad just cool that my post got that much exposure
MMA,not_removed,sorry wrong guy you were the one that bet on sucking his own dick do it
MMA,not_removed,a greeting from bj would have been pretty cool years ago but nowadays who knows
MMA,not_removed,a song lasts a life time a blowjob lasts seconds on a good day
MMA,not_removed,would you like a hummer at halftime a hummer on ashtons birthday
MMA,not_removed,isnt he retired she asked him for a video and he redirected her to his website felt like a scam so she messaged gsp instead
MMA,not_removed,sick burn man super effective against strangers you know nothing about
MMA,not_removed,listen you uneducated fool
MMA,not_removed,ohhhhhh good one
MMA,not_removed,i need a backstory for this its everywhere
MMA,not_removed,somebody is forgetting a magic night in the company of tito ortiz
MMA,not_removed,hes surprisingly good at bloodborne it was a long fight and he manages to whoop my ass up to a cliff and boop me off
MMA,not_removed,dont even remember it now you might see it on his stream he goes by and his name was pretty similar
MMA,not_removed,everyones everquest guild had a weird guy it seems my raiding guild had a guy who invented some infomercial bullshit product and retired due to the amount of money it made it was a really stupid invention too and he was nuts
MMA,not_removed,come join us
MMA,not_removed,which one is he
MMA,not_removed,someone get this man a proper blowjob
MMA,not_removed,i love you i see you soon boy
MMA,not_removed,this is a good one an underrated meme
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,platinum mike perry went to shake hyun gyu lims hand before pulling back and screaming thought you had a friend booiiiii aggggghhhhh this incident combined with platinums constant unmatched meatheadness led to him becoming rmma top and the thought you had a boiiii aghhhhhhhh meme was born
MMA,not_removed,mike perrys first weighin
MMA,not_removed,hahaha ive never seen that its beautiful
MMA,not_removed,damn tito is approaching kyle levels of awkward
MMA,not_removed,i could understand him not being a god at fpss but actionadventure and fighting games i could see him being good at
MMA,not_removed,he doesnt play much anymore
MMA,not_removed,you
MMA,not_removed,i would love to but i am in wisconsin and wont be able to get off work
MMA,not_removed,titan on the far right also vamp hunter d at the time
MMA,not_removed,maybe he already gets the best and thats why it only lasts seconds
MMA,not_removed,rmma just unleashing the memes in this post hahaha
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,hall of cost is probably my favorite phonetic misunderstandings of all time
MMA,not_removed,no fucking way since that day i thought it was thought you had a plan boiiii damn son platinum savage
MMA,not_removed,i think hes super gold in sfv which is really decent
MMA,not_removed,yeah hes been playing a lot of lately its a decent game so far but its buggy enough to make people like drdisrespect and incredibly angry
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,lol i meant in wow
MMA,not_removed,so get him a few beers
MMA,not_removed,yeah i could see that happening from him
MMA,not_removed,ohh lol i dont play wow or i would too little time to game anymore
MMA,not_removed,we are on sargeras but the guild is on a kinda low pop situation right now because of djs camp we havent been able to have a steady raid schedule after his fight we are going to map that out and schedule stuff and start recruiting
MMA,not_removed,any and everyone is welcome
MMA,not_removed,alliance join our mighty squad discord dj is up in here usually in the subs only chat where only subs to his twitch channel get accesss too
MMA,not_removed,i dont know why people are so shocked by this conan has been heavily involved in the fighting community since httpiimgurcomgdmvijgjpg
MMA,not_removed,conan vs cm punk
MMA,not_removed,ari gold working that hollywood magic
MMA,not_removed,people are gonna lose their shit lol its so cool to see guys like conan turning into huge fans of mma reminds me when i first started getting really into it
MMA,not_removed,mark wahlberg is interesting hes a huge fan of boxing and put on a bet on pacquiao to beat mayweather it may sound weird but boxing events arent just for fans tons of celebs go just to socialise so having all these celebrities invest in the ufc could really help it grow
MMA,not_removed,well thats cool as shit the more mainstream the better kimmel got a piece probably explains the showing of the jeremy stevens clip last night
MMA,not_removed,rogan should invest
MMA,not_removed,its the best time to be a mma fan right now i believe this is the golden era of mma
MMA,not_removed,funniest part is conor fighting on fight night
MMA,not_removed,this is like when celebrities bought part of the mets
MMA,not_removed,read conan as conor dammit
MMA,not_removed,i think people think this is a joke
MMA,not_removed,holy shit thats genius they probably gave them an insanely good investment deal just in order to get that many big celebrities with a vested interest basically instead of paying them big money to endorse ufc they give them a small stake for cheap to have them essentially become mainstream ambassadors sounds like the new owners could potentially blow the roof off of this with their connections
MMA,not_removed,cool good way to build publicity this kind of investment encourages media to promote the ufc more by talking about it and hopefully having more fighters on as guests giving people a chance to show themselves to the public
MMA,not_removed,i thought this was a huge troll job for the segment
MMA,not_removed,actually kind of funny
MMA,not_removed,kimmel and conan both promoting conor lol
MMA,not_removed,i hope ben affleck makes an mma movie
MMA,not_removed,this is how you take the ufc to the next level genius move
MMA,not_removed,is any fighter a part owner of the ufc
MMA,not_removed,i read it as conor being a part owner of the ufc biggest wtf moment ive had for while haha
MMA,not_removed,so did anyone else take the ronda fight here as an announcement
MMA,not_removed,anyone else think conan looks like a red headed less muscular chael
MMA,not_removed,hes big on boston too he keeps trying to convince people to cast him as a southie irish gangster
MMA,not_removed,with the way ufc matchmakes and their greed i can see conan getting a title shot in in any weight class he chooses maybe two weight classes the same night
MMA,not_removed,id ground n pound maria big time
MMA,not_removed,some people were scared of the new ownership when the deal went down but i saw differently now the ufc is in the hands of people with even more money and connections in order to get more viewers now we shouldnt have to deal with money matchups and super fights while screwing over the pecking order of fighters hopefully will jumpstart this new management and make rankings actually matter and get rid of reebok
MMA,not_removed,so are tom brady mark wahlberg ben affleck jimmy kimmel cam newton sylvester stallone etc a bunch of other celebrities
MMA,not_removed,im sure conor got a little part too
MMA,not_removed,wme era is surreal
MMA,not_removed,expect alot more ufc appearances on late night television
MMA,not_removed,conan look like a male street walkerï»¿
MMA,not_removed,he said he was going to fight he cant be any worse than cm punk
MMA,not_removed,how come he hasnt showed up to an event yet
MMA,not_removed,dang chad mendes had no chance
MMA,not_removed,i timestamped it but the whole skit is great
MMA,not_removed,heres the full sketch
MMA,not_removed,conan the barbarian obrien
MMA,not_removed,i got conan
MMA,not_removed,conan vs edmond after that as well
MMA,not_removed,all hail our new overlords
MMA,not_removed,whether or not he likes the sport i suspect hell be subtly promoting it for a while now
MMA,not_removed,wasnt the maypac audience pretty much celebrities
MMA,not_removed,thats when you have fuck you money
MMA,not_removed,and put on a bet on pacquiao to beat mayweather what a dumbass lol
MMA,not_removed,yeah sounds like a mcgregor fight
MMA,not_removed,damn ufc is definitely going to hit million ppv buys now with that celebrity endorsement
MMA,not_removed,id imagine all these part owners will help promote the sport too
MMA,not_removed,cant read the story subscription required
MMA,not_removed,he cant because hes gonna start his own promotion soon
MMA,not_removed,does he have enough money
MMA,not_removed,i look forward to posts in three years titled dae miss the zuffa era
MMA,not_removed,mma started getting really big when i was in high school in the mid before that it was some sort of underground kick boxer ultra violent alternative sport now i think its being accepted in pop culture its becoming the biggest combat sport even more popular than boxing or wrestling ufc will obviously be the biggest in mma but i predict there might be serious competition in the future the future of mma is bright and with lots of money to be had from the young year old male demographic
MMA,not_removed,i might get a lot of hate for this but i still think pride has the golden era of mma
MMA,not_removed,but conor mcgregor fans ruined rmma s
MMA,not_removed,for the lightweight belt guess they spoiled the script
MMA,not_removed,well yeah conans memorial ppv would go for way more than
MMA,not_removed,wait is this real about all the celebrities being owners i still dont know if the joke is going over my head or what
MMA,not_removed,gili where he fights jennifer lopez in a cage match
MMA,not_removed,they got rocky balboa
MMA,not_removed,usually pretty busy
MMA,not_removed,nightly show and young kids would be my guess it was banned in his state to boot also hasnt talked about mma till mcgregor and the irish connection happened
MMA,not_removed,with the right attitude and enough psoriasis cream anyone has a chance
MMA,not_removed,this is awesome
MMA,not_removed,definitely the funniest conan skit ive ever seen thank you so much for posting this
MMA,not_removed,that darkhaired woman needs to star in more videos
MMA,not_removed,i dont know if its just me but theres something extremely cringeworthy about that performance reminds me of some segal shit
MMA,not_removed,hes got an incredible reach and hes nearly transparent when shirtless easy money
MMA,not_removed,he seems to have gained an interest ever since mcgregor became a thing given conan makes a big deal about being irish
MMA,not_removed,i suspect hell be subtly promoting it for a while now didnt he already
MMA,not_removed,and dude dressed as the burger king guy
MMA,not_removed,when floor seats cost upwards of then basically yeah
MMA,not_removed,lol he probably did it because he has more heart or some other stupid bullshit i made tons of money that night from casuals keeping the betting lines way closer than they should be
MMA,not_removed,casual here did pac really have that low of a chance is it that mayweather is just better or that his style counters pacs
MMA,not_removed,i mean its not not those things
MMA,not_removed,i wonder how long the deal has been in place because i remember
MMA,not_removed,id imagine all these part owners will help promote the sport too i think this is exactly why they let them be investors now all these celebrity cunts will talk about the ufc and promote it
MMA,not_removed,stadium fighting league no time or space restrictions
MMA,not_removed,roganfc is gonna be two guys fighting in the middle of a football field with no cage hell allow stomps soccer kicks and lesnaresque levels of juicing the fighters wont walk out via a tunnel on field level they will be poured onto the canvas from a vat of nuclear waste
MMA,not_removed,hes got that onnit money bro
MMA,not_removed,nick diaz managed to do it so i suppose yes
MMA,not_removed,he only got paid million to fight fucking peanuts
MMA,not_removed,you dont have to wait that long i already miss the zuffa era
MMA,not_removed,high school jeez youre making me feel old
MMA,not_removed,unless its for billion dollars
MMA,not_removed,for hardcore fans for sure it was fun af
MMA,not_removed,conans been in la since he took over the tonight show they film in burbank
MMA,not_removed,hes a five foot overblown bodybuilder
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,its just you
MMA,not_removed,i think rousey was first on there in recent times
MMA,not_removed,which is weird because he was born in massachusetts
MMA,not_removed,the biggest celebrity of them all
MMA,not_removed,that was actually daniel craig
MMA,not_removed,he bet p diddy
MMA,not_removed,pac could have only won by knocking him out you cant knock out what you cant reach years before pac would have definetely had a chance but not when it happened
MMA,not_removed,that limits it to two disciplines and the ufc mma includes those things but it includes much more
MMA,not_removed,batman needs better tdd i hear deathstrokes got a mean double leg
MMA,not_removed,yea if this is a new kind of product placement i wouldnt be surprised
MMA,not_removed,cm punks next opponent should be ben affleck id pay for that ppv
MMA,not_removed,last thing i thought was ufc when i watched bvs i dont get the comparison at allthe fighting is like in a superhero movie or comic book that would be an accurate comparison
MMA,not_removed,it just happened i doubt the celebrities are going to be obligated to do promotion wmeimg represents a metric shitton of celebrities musicians djs etc etc etc they could have offered ownership to anyone they wanted but they specifically chose people that they knew to be fans of the ufc they essentially turned fanscelebrities into owners if you owned a small piece of a sport or show that you loved do you think you may tend to talk about it even more now imagine you are a celebrity and you know very well that alot of people listen to you and that promoting the ufc might make you alittle extra money this makes it much more likely that these celebrities will want to discuss the ufc btw most of these celebrities are clients of wme whom may act as their so in a way wmeimg works for them really its a mutual relationship agents get paid by percentage of what an actor makes their incentives are mutually aligned please note this is often the complete opposite way of how the ufc tends to do business aside from maybe the top fighters the ufc seems to want to maintain maximum control over the fighters taking away their sponsorships owning their likeness forever denying boring fighters the chance to prove themselves an actor wants his agent to strike the best deals an agent wants his clients to perform well and be very successful and popular etc if either party stops meeting expectations than they can be dropped the agency can always book more talent the actor can always use a different agency
MMA,not_removed,and no usada
MMA,not_removed,with elbows to the back of the head and no gloves
MMA,not_removed,literally operating outside the bounds of time and space audience members will be required to consume dmt
MMA,not_removed,or he could take the dragon ball z route in stadium design like this httpimgurcomvzcaqjc
MMA,not_removed,pride never dies it just gets bigger stages
MMA,not_removed,onnit
MMA,not_removed,will they stop forcing these men to fight for literally nothing god
MMA,not_removed,i think it is already painfully obvious that dana doesnt have the power he used to have hes always been very outspoken even for him about how much he hates the kind of matchmaking that goes on in boxing with him recently being so adamant about conor giving up or defending the fw belt i think that is what he wants but it is out of his hands
MMA,not_removed,totally forgot he moved ive even been to a taping of the tonight show and the tbs show lol
MMA,not_removed,why did you type out five but use how about a little consistency when youre being twatty
MMA,not_removed,seems like it im ready for my downvotes
MMA,not_removed,im not saying he was the first mma fighter on his show rousey was huge at the time and i imagine wme her reps even before the buyout were working their asses off to get her booked on stuff mcgregor on the other hand conan ran with the irish thing he seemed genuinely interested in him and did bits on him even when mcgregor wasnt on the show
MMA,not_removed,biggest us population of irish americans in massachusetts iirc
MMA,not_removed,grappling and striking would be more appropriate two words
MMA,not_removed,its actually a decent description for a general audience someone who has no knowledge of combat sports whatsoever wont necessarily know the terms grappling and striking mma fans can distinguish between wrestling and other forms of grappling but for the average person wrestling is a good catchall term
MMA,not_removed,bellator uses cages
MMA,not_removed,everybodys got fuckin super powers batman
MMA,not_removed,i mean it has to be that because the style of fighting hes describing isnt similar to conor more like lawler but conor is the most recognizable name i guess
MMA,not_removed,i think affleck would murder him with no training
MMA,not_removed,use the code word joe rogan
MMA,not_removed,god damn it this matchmaking is nothing like boxing how often do you see the a fight the caliber of conoralvarez in boxing a legit superfight with two really high level competitors when they start booking conor vs joe lauzon for the title then you can cry boxing but thats just not the case right now
MMA,not_removed,probably that prior nearly years of him in front of an nyc backdrop
MMA,not_removed,make me
MMA,not_removed,conan not being on a mainstream network meant that fewer alist acting people would be on the show but that really allowed him to expand beyond hollywood and look towards people from other types of media as well
MMA,not_removed,underrated comment
MMA,not_removed,i think he just picked the biggest name out of the hat to describe ufc type fighting doesnt sound like hes in on the nuances of individual fighter styles then again the guy is a fucking part owner
MMA,not_removed,its actually just rogan for off any and all supplements
MMA,not_removed,hey you fucking leave joe lauzon alone buddy
MMA,not_removed,hey you leave joe out of this
MMA,not_removed,hey joe is a solid fighter with a some grade a bjj he has the most fight of the night bonuses for a reason wouldnt be a cake walk for conor
MMA,not_removed,when they start booking bisping vs hendo for the title then you can cry boxing but thats just not the case right now ummmmok so can we cry boxing now
MMA,not_removed,a legit superfight its not even close to a legit superfight these are two guys who have never defended their titles not a single defense between them its not like theyre reigning champs who have cleared out their divisions and this is the fight to make
MMA,not_removed,how often do you see the a fight the caliber of conoralvarez in boxing a legit superfight with two really high level competitors canelokhan was pretty much the boxing equivalent of this and it was whatever when they start booking conor vs joe lauzon for the title then you can cry boxing but thats just not the case right now how about when they book year old dan henderson for a title shot on an impressive one fight win streak and at least canelo had to vacate his belt
MMA,not_removed,youre joking but saying its like wwe but real would have been the best description to casuals
MMA,not_removed,this batman fights like dominick cruz doesnt work as well as hilarious as the film would be
MMA,not_removed,damn ive forgotten already i need some alpha brain in that case
MMA,not_removed,dude i get that lauzon lurks here but he would definitely be considered easy compared to the people at the top of the division
MMA,not_removed,lauzon is a cool fighter but that would definitely be a boxingesque decision hes far from the best at his weight class
MMA,not_removed,both multi promotion champions these guys both got chops
MMA,not_removed,champion vs champion is always a super fight dont get it twisted
MMA,not_removed,because he didnt want to fight ggg
MMA,not_removed,demian maia hope batman doesnt run into any multiple opponents
MMA,not_removed,lol can you imagine batman in his big ass suit bobbing and weaving using incredible footwork to skip around between enemy to enemy haha it would be like the batman video games almost
MMA,not_removed,batman dancing around his opponents and throwing feints but rarely hitting them eventually jim gordon comes in and gives him the decision win
MMA,not_removed,jlau isnt an easy fight for anyone at
MMA,not_removed,yes but they are untested as far as consistently beating the most white hot contenders goes there is a difference between fighting people of various levels streak to become champ and continuing this streak by fighting only against the cream of the crop if i look at weidman for example i am much more impressed by his title defenses than anything else he has done in his career
MMA,not_removed,b
MMA,not_removed,champion vs champion in different weight classes is always a super fight two champions unifying the belt is not always a super fight
MMA,not_removed,i think he means is that while this is the first mma superfight it isnt really the sort of superfight akin to gspanderson silva or even aldopettis you can have a beggars cant be choosers kind of mindset but this particular superfight is pretty mild in everything but hype
MMA,not_removed,thats right yes
MMA,not_removed,id love a minute sequence in the next movie where batman takes on guys by methodically working for a single leg and taking their back one by one
MMA,not_removed,yeah but the games dont have spans where gotham doesnt have batman for year stretches because he tore both his acls
MMA,not_removed,ok but would you agree that wed be getting into boxing matchup style where the big guy would be taking much easier fights than he could to somewhat guarantee a victory an example being most recently canelosmith
MMA,not_removed,conor would find his chin really easy
MMA,not_removed,the climax of the film is a fight between him and deathstoke ebi rules
MMA,not_removed,yes you are right the lauzon fanboys have no sense of objectivity
MMA,not_removed,that slap to set up the strike was so money
MMA,not_removed,ken is a legend gets uneeded bad rep
MMA,not_removed,tldr king mo loves everything my man is full of love
MMA,not_removed,actually i see him more of a pro wrestler with his exuberant entrances like the one he did in strike force
MMA,not_removed,he was in tna when they started bringing in a bunch of mma guys but seeing his fights you can tell he fell in love with his hands and rarely reverts to his wrestling
MMA,not_removed,i love wolves i like dogs and i like dog training but i love wolves wolf is my love that and cats and puppies
MMA,not_removed,oh and kickboxing cant forget kickboxing bjj too bjj is great
MMA,not_removed,so basically he hates jiu jitsu lol
MMA,not_removed,then why didnt he box
MMA,not_removed,ken shamrock says pro wrestling is alot harder than mma
MMA,not_removed,king mo on pro wrestling are you still training wrestling at all you know what wrestlings just too hard to my body man if i do anything i wouldnt mind being a manager or some guy that comes in and interferes with matches but you know right now im just a fan of it i watch it i know that in my opinion its harder to do that than it is to do mma so mma is more about reactions and protecting yourself pro wrestling has more rules to the game the techniques and being able to do work with whoever you wrestle with at any time its just different httpuproxxcomsportsbellatorkingmorampagejacksonrematchinterview
MMA,not_removed,always cool seeing coach anthony in his corner
MMA,not_removed,what about otters
MMA,not_removed,one of my favorite for for anyone that doesnt want to watch ali vs holmes was like bj vs edgar except more brutal and depressing edit holmes also famously was caught crying after the fight for brutally beating ali one cool thing is however after the fight mike tyson got on the phone with ali and told him hell get him one day years later tyson knocked the fuck out of holmes
MMA,not_removed,cant believe so many people criticise holmes for taking this fight like it makes him a bae person huge payday plus ali wanted it
MMA,not_removed,what is the most baffling about this is the parallels between alis coming back from retirement and larrys against tyson both guys were the same age had been retired the same amount of time you wouldve thought after larry beat ali so horribly to the point larry cried backstage and was severely depressed afterwards he wouldve known better than to come out of retirement of nearly years at the age of the to fight a prime mike tyson member what you did to ali larry no motherfucker you clearly didnt member
MMA,not_removed,this doc was absolutely brutal to watch i remember watching it a couple years back when all the cte news starting pouring out incredible documentary for sure tho highly recommended for fight fans
MMA,not_removed,its ironicdepressing how cyclical these things are holmes himself came out of retirement to fight tyson and was long past his prime by that time i saw an interview with him where he said he wanted a year to get back in shape and train but don king demanded that he take the fight sooner or not at all even so holmes length jab and clinch gave tyson problems early on before tysons aggression prevailed
MMA,not_removed,at just tyson speaks with ali
MMA,not_removed,honestly i wanted to mention bj in the title i just couldnt deal with his nut huggers someone should do a comparison with bj and ali in these fights so similar
MMA,not_removed,holmes did come out of retirement but it wasnt like that was his last fight he fought for years after the tyson fight
MMA,not_removed,ali was and had been retired years when he came out of retirement to fight larry larry was and had been retired years when he came out of retirement to fight tyson
MMA,not_removed,you linked to the main page i looked up the article heres what i found httpawesomejellycomtheamazingstoryofhowateenagemiketysonvowedrevengeonlarryholmesforbeatingmuhammadali
MMA,not_removed,why not tag carwin though hes actually in his and heavyweight like ali
MMA,not_removed,sorry for the confusion mike said hed get holmes
MMA,not_removed,both men were years old ali when he fought holmes holmes when he fought tyson holmes was overweight and coming off a year lay off tyson clearly did not fight the same holmes ali did
MMA,not_removed,never saw him get beat up like that in fact i think hell be putting fedor in that spot maldonado almost merked him for gods sake that said i wouldnt mind hearing him weigh in
MMA,not_removed,holmes seems to still have all his marbles i dont think he ever took the punishment ali did also all the thyroid pills and diuretics ali took probably didnt help
MMA,not_removed,i never said they fought the same man all i was saying is that holmes fought years after this it wasnt like this was his retirement fight or anything
MMA,not_removed,spooky
MMA,not_removed,true i was wrong about ali looks like he was late in this fight
MMA,not_removed,man he really took those prime foreman and frazier punches for endless rounds what an iron chinned warrior
MMA,not_removed,weird the way he slides his hand down his chest and onto his dick
MMA,not_removed,i see you dc with your fake jones ball grab
MMA,not_removed,he pinch the peen
MMA,not_removed,why would he hang his body pillow in his gym like that
MMA,not_removed,all i see is dc caressing jones abs
MMA,not_removed,dc really set himself up here
MMA,not_removed,bag no hit back mr miyagi
MMA,not_removed,why the fuck did his hand slide down like that and pull on jones crotch area that was a little creepy
MMA,not_removed,has a fighter ever acted super gay to put their opponent off
MMA,not_removed,can anyone slow this gif down and insert appropriate music
MMA,not_removed,jon is living rent free in daniels head
MMA,not_removed,why is he rubbing on then pinches jons junk
MMA,not_removed,im cringen my balls off right now
MMA,not_removed,no homo
MMA,not_removed,im dying man dc has his very on jbj waifu
MMA,not_removed,congrats you played yourself
MMA,not_removed,oh dc you tried
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,rcringe
MMA,not_removed,he had to get a picture from the jbj vs gustafsson fight because if he used a picture of jbj from his fight he wouldnt look anywhere near that dc is shook
MMA,not_removed,they took that photo when he fought gustafsson not dc
MMA,not_removed,nice dick pinch jones is doomed when dc releases that move
MMA,not_removed,why did he touch jons pp
MMA,not_removed,these two dudes need to just fuck already and get it over with
MMA,not_removed,lmao i hope dc beats bones
MMA,not_removed,i love dc
MMA,not_removed,seriously dont get dc reasoning for talking so much shit after getting beat by jones he is the new tito ortiz
MMA,not_removed,dc showing us the only way he could beat jon jones
MMA,not_removed,may at utc talking shit huh i am bot for bugssuggestionsfeedback httpsnpredditcommessagecomposetobestmeampsubjectinstagrammirrorhttpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,jones gonna respond with a life size weeble of dc
MMA,not_removed,ah man this gonna be used as ammo if dc loses again
MMA,not_removed,thats a pretty realistic love pillow i didnt need to see him fondle it though
MMA,not_removed,god this is gonna backfire meme so hard on him sohard
MMA,not_removed,that dick pinch is some of the most akward shit
MMA,not_removed,i dont know why but everytime i see dc do something i feel like jon smiles and gets more confident but that last fight of his was a wake up call this next should be real legit
MMA,not_removed,watch the video before you post the video dc yeeikes
MMA,not_removed,he pulls down a zipper on his pants why would you do that
MMA,not_removed,oh boy
MMA,not_removed,poor dc everything he does can be turned around to make him look like a goon
MMA,not_removed,dc is secretly gay and would love to suck long jon
MMA,not_removed,that was kind of gayyyyyyyyyyyyy
MMA,not_removed,pause
MMA,not_removed,haha even jon jones the punching bag is taller than cormier
MMA,not_removed,man jon jones gonna have some ammo for the next time hes on a mic
MMA,not_removed,this way he can spit in his face without worrying about jones literally killing him then again do you think hes just going to sit there and let jon kill him
MMA,not_removed,love my boy dc but he need to be training and praying right now for this rematch with bones
MMA,not_removed,look what alexander did to jones faceabsolutely ruined it dem lips were like balloons
MMA,not_removed,ayy
MMA,not_removed,stare long enough into the abyss and the abyss will stare back into you dc slowly turning into the villain
MMA,not_removed,fatty gonna get slayed again
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure hes just treating jon like hes a bitch
MMA,not_removed,he pinched his dick at the end would tap
MMA,not_removed,well he is the biggest pussy jones has ever met
MMA,not_removed,something something freud
MMA,not_removed,dc might be undercover gay
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,and now youre acting like us making out at aka never happened jon youre so fake jon
MMA,not_removed,he said you want that as he did it and then slapped him and did the no finger lol
MMA,not_removed,different kind of eye poke
MMA,not_removed,yea real weird im really hoping for either him or jones to be koed in the next fight
MMA,not_removed,he gave jones a dick pinch
MMA,not_removed,unlike any other fighter ive ever seen dc always manages to find a way to make every trash talking moment awkward
MMA,not_removed,httpimgurcomxulqkkk
MMA,not_removed,to show off the waifu
MMA,not_removed,stupid sexy jones
MMA,not_removed,and penis if you look closely
MMA,not_removed,yeah i can almost hear it already
MMA,not_removed,he ran full speed into this one
MMA,not_removed,worst trash talk in the buisness
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,only in pro wrestling in the and was that gorgeous george character was hilarious
MMA,not_removed,im on it
MMA,not_removed,such is the theme of all dcs attempts at jon
MMA,not_removed,all jones needs to do is find a picture of dc crying after their fight and hes got his rebuttal video
MMA,not_removed,this is whats sad about it he used a picture from a fight he wasnt involved in much like how bisping mentioned that rockhold was knocked out by vitor yes thats true but irrelevant when rockhold submitted bisping when they fought
MMA,not_removed,seriously
MMA,not_removed,oooh exciting i hope jones beats dc
MMA,not_removed,dc showing us the only way he could beat jon jones off ftfy
MMA,not_removed,dont know why you were down voted youre right dc is terrible at shit talking and needs to focus on his training
MMA,not_removed,yeah man every time a girl grabs my dick and caresses my abs she makes me feel like a bitch
MMA,not_removed,nah bones pee hole so big it gets wedgies dc just puling a solid
MMA,not_removed,people are what they eat a dickhead like jj should know that
MMA,not_removed,something something priming
MMA,not_removed,nah he just loves cake
MMA,not_removed,i used to think the cop was weird in this situation but now i think its the dude who has their dick out above their belt line while walking around
MMA,not_removed,more like jons cuckhold
MMA,not_removed,hey man you watched the clip too
MMA,not_removed,im so dead right now but i think dc trying to act gay to throw of his opponent war dc
MMA,not_removed,yep its the awkward mma equivalent of carlton vs will
MMA,not_removed,where can i get the luke rockhold one its for a friend
MMA,not_removed,he just set himself up for weeks of constant memes and deleted jones videos of pure torture
MMA,not_removed,bag no pinch back kenny miyagi
MMA,not_removed,yeah man kflo waz here
MMA,not_removed,never gets old lol
MMA,not_removed,golddust in the was about as gay as they came in that era
MMA,not_removed,waiting
MMA,not_removed,he is his own rebuttal video
MMA,not_removed,people dont train hours a day i am pretty sure he is focused on his training people still have time to do other things
MMA,not_removed,its that diamond shaped pee hole
MMA,not_removed,i just lold
MMA,not_removed,i just want my kids back
MMA,not_removed,i do it so my boner wont be exposed in situations where i am wearing basketball shorts it really works
MMA,not_removed,sometimes i tuck my boner into my belt to avoid the obvious pant line boner this guy probably had a fear boner
MMA,not_removed,guys with big cocks
MMA,not_removed,this is the support group for that
MMA,not_removed,ive always been your friend is this a birthday present awesome
MMA,not_removed,yeah he did the whole gorgeous george act
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,off
MMA,not_removed,honestly now its a business idea
MMA,not_removed,perfect
MMA,not_removed,goddamn this is hilarious
MMA,not_removed,makes the pinch at the end all that more awkward lmao
MMA,not_removed,make it a post so we can upvote the shit out of it
MMA,not_removed,so funny
MMA,not_removed,dc already practicing sliding his hand down jons smooth cylindrical body
MMA,not_removed,a draw would be insane and highly unlikely
MMA,not_removed,mma gone sexual
MMA,not_removed,youll need testers just saying
MMA,not_removed,ill send you a prototype if you guys let me advertise the product
MMA,not_removed,in editing he does to sound that what luke rockhold does to vaginas amazing
MMA,not_removed,the ufc needs this guy on their payroll
MMA,not_removed,his jones video gets me so hyped he keeps them just short enough that im itching for more also great choice of music one of the few youtube channels ive actually subscribed to
MMA,not_removed,man i have seen a lot of mma videos and hype videos and all that stuff but what you captured in this video legit gave me goosebumps the little moments that can easily be forgotten op has a real talent and im so happy hes sharing that with the world
MMA,not_removed,love ukwozymotos work i still remember his superb conordiaz promo
MMA,not_removed,this man deserves a check from the ufc for each video he puts out
MMA,not_removed,as soon as i discovered his channel i knew he was special kwozymoto mikefightpromo hizzer edits brattmamley they all got something going right now
MMA,not_removed,kwozymoto is definitely the most talented of the freelance guys out there
MMA,not_removed,this video exemplifies what excellence feels like
MMA,not_removed,i love this video
MMA,not_removed,this does so much to encapsulate what i love about this great sport its the individuals and the emotion
MMA,not_removed,great piece i just subscribed to ks channel thanks
MMA,not_removed,why he does it for free
MMA,not_removed,its flawless editting presenting the sport in a completely different light to the norm
MMA,not_removed,so hes exclusively ufc and not producing any work a potential competitor his videos could easily get me hyped for a belator event if he done one
MMA,not_removed,and just to see them distributed to a wider audience and used as official promos because the quality is that good
MMA,not_removed,thanks so much for the kind words man really appreciate it all these comments just blow me away every time also should have a mighty mouse one up tomorrow
MMA,not_removed,there probably something more to it than that youd think any one promotion would hire him
MMA,not_removed,i love his videos but i dont think they are very marketable to try and attract new followers i love the violin because i know the emotion that goes into the sport but i can see how that can not be so effective on people who are new
MMA,not_removed,good man the last huarche lights mighty mouse one is a favourite of mine
MMA,not_removed,downvote me bitches i want to be in hour
MMA,not_removed,i think youre thinking way too far ahead first step would be to find a local gym try it out and see if you have a knack for fighting lotta people realize its not for them once they catch a good shot to the head or gut
MMA,not_removed,kevin ross started muay thai at and is now the lionfight champ son its never too late pull you finger out and join an mma gym
MMA,not_removed,a great mma fighter yes probably too late unless you find a cody mckenzieesque trick you can spam in every fight
MMA,not_removed,well ill be honest its not going to be easy but nothing in life worth wanting is at your hope is that you body is fully grown so you can compete at either or assuming your body isnt grown would likely be your home but i suppose that also involves how much body fat you carry then again worry about that before you have any formal training might as well be a waste of time my opinion is that if you are going to train at least once a day for years then youll be ready for your first amateur fight if youre coming from no martial arts background if you have any sort of background even tma then you may have a small leg up on some people if you are small it may not be easy to learn but if you have a camp that views everyone as training partners instead of pieces of meat then youll stand a chance id say good luck but id also keep in mind that its not a sport with much money behind it at any level unless youre a borderline household name
MMA,not_removed,well this became a nuclear meltdown quick
MMA,not_removed,dont tell me what to do ill upvote you and youll like it
MMA,not_removed,a charitable man
MMA,not_removed,go sign up for a gym worst case scenario you find a fun hobby to do instead of becoming the new gsp
MMA,not_removed,is this the second latest submission in ufc history behind mm v kyoji
MMA,not_removed,i love that quote by faber
MMA,not_removed,i love that quote by faber
MMA,not_removed,frankie beat the fuck out of swanson in this fight crazy how active he was on the ground there he landed so many shots from the top
MMA,not_removed,frankieee breaking necks and cashing cheques
MMA,not_removed,i was there live in austin fights were pretty good and i got to meet pvz the day before her ufc debut frankie looked like an absolute monster in that main event though
MMA,not_removed,what happened to cub he was such a hot prospect and was on an impressive winning streak up until the frankie fight then kinda went inactive and wasnt the same once back
MMA,not_removed,i missed this fight was edgar behind on the scorecards
MMA,not_removed,as a cub i was disappointed in the outcome of this fight but godamn edgar is tough mofo
MMA,not_removed,yeah at the time of this fight it was the latest finish then mighty mouse had to go an oneup edgar like a douchebag s
MMA,not_removed,which quote
MMA,not_removed,which quote
MMA,not_removed,i hate watching neck cranks my aching neck pinches watching this i feel like i can watch the blood bath between cain and bigfoot but nah cant take neck cranks
MMA,not_removed,cubs been very unlucky with injurys hes had some realy badluck and had his jaw wired numerous times he would of been champ if it wasnt for that imo
MMA,not_removed,frankie took his soul
MMA,not_removed,nope edgar was beating the fuck out of swanson like no other on his way to a decision easily the most dominant performance of edgars career
MMA,not_removed,yeah bro im an otter and i was pretty upset too
MMA,not_removed,i remember watching this and thinking how is anyone gonna break that record then five months later
MMA,not_removed,the one you used in the title fool
MMA,not_removed,deja vu
MMA,not_removed,the one op used in the title fool
MMA,not_removed,simulated death match
MMA,not_removed,thats really unfortunate i remember him being a big threat and was always impressed every time he fought hopefully he can get another roll going and get that shot
MMA,not_removed,and choi is about to take his spot
MMA,not_removed,did you forget the third bj penn fight happened
MMA,not_removed,outlanded cub i remember how the fight went but still what the fuck
MMA,not_removed,thanks im an idiot
MMA,not_removed,maybe but choi is still an unknown quantity at this point and i wouldnt be surprised to see cub beat him
MMA,not_removed,probably the only fight that has ever made me feel physically sick from the sadness of bjs downfall that i had to stop watching
MMA,not_removed,penns performance was awful but this was a worse beating by far imo
MMA,not_removed,theyre for the media more than the average fan
MMA,not_removed,press conferences are expensive conference calls are not
MMA,not_removed,for me unless its conor diaz or yoelbisping then i dont watchlisten
MMA,not_removed,its an easy way for journalists to get up to date quotes for writtenradio media in the leadup to the fight before the fighters are due to be onsite for the fight its just about sustained media coverage for the ufc this one isnt so much for the fans and wasnt always posted for them to use
MMA,not_removed,pad guy should run at him in a cartoonish manner
MMA,not_removed,i pray to the mma gods for a highlight real ko by silva
MMA,not_removed,looks like hes working on that left hand counter against brunson
MMA,not_removed,goat
MMA,not_removed,can he stop the takedown though
MMA,not_removed,i still feel he has a title run left if he takes it serious
MMA,not_removed,after all the usual rmma posts that show bad formstriking this was pleasant a fighter training a specific aspect of his training in a well done and thought out manner weird how it seems strange to see
MMA,not_removed,im sorry to say as much i like silva he looks very stiff
MMA,not_removed,jan at utc ð½ð½ð½ð½ð½ð½â³âï¸â³âï¸â³â³âï¸âï¸â³âï¸âï¸âï¸â³â³âï¸âï¸âï¸âï¸â³âï¸âï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸ð¤¼ââï¸â³âï¸âï¸â³âï¸âï¸ httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,no mask for once interesting
MMA,not_removed,he looks a little slow honestly and i know its pad work but brunson is going to be significantly faster than him
MMA,not_removed,he looks like hes slowed down quite a bit hes not the same guy who stopped vitor with a front kick out of nowhere
MMA,not_removed,its amazing how imperfect his boxing technique looks compared to a pure boxer maybe it shouldnt be surprising but his striking was so good when he was in his prime that i would expect him to look more technical here
MMA,not_removed,pads dont hit back
MMA,not_removed,usadasilva
MMA,not_removed,the werdum move
MMA,not_removed,may the rest of the card be an offering so we can get that one ko
MMA,not_removed,thats like my number one reason for and how i started watching mma
MMA,not_removed,and practicing fighting with his back to wall
MMA,not_removed,fingers crossed for another hail mary triangle if he doesnt
MMA,not_removed,dont think hes taking it lightly dudes in fighter years hes like or
MMA,not_removed,as much as bispings title story was amazing and a great moment in mma history anderson beating brunson calling out bisping and getting a title shot would be an awesome end to his career
MMA,not_removed,i want to believe
MMA,not_removed,sadly i dont see anderson beating anybody ranked ahead of him if he beats brunson he should retire
MMA,not_removed,why is it that mma fans have no concept of ageing curves and just how much little decline is required in this sport before youre no longer competitive
MMA,not_removed,i dont think hes looked bad in his last fights its just been a bunch of bullshiteyeroll loses the most frustrating was bisping he had that fight in the bag and took the entire round off the dc fight was just a fuck it fight etc
MMA,not_removed,by mma standards it wouldnt even be that crazy
MMA,not_removed,no he cant hes getting chinny now too dont forget he got dropped twice by bisping that would have never happened in his prime
MMA,not_removed,he never was the faster man its his timing that is truly phenominal
MMA,not_removed,you dont say years a knockout and a leg break tends to do that
MMA,not_removed,boxers dont have to worry about takedowns im sure its easier to have perfect boxing form if youve never had to be aware of takedown attempts on your life just be thankful an mma fighter can throw hands that well
MMA,not_removed,what i think this is is a glimpse inside a person teaching their body reactions this is basically role playing with specific moves advancing opponent working with his back to the ropescage to build familiarity identify bad reactions and instill good ones pretty fascinating really repetition makes things naturalâautomatic evenâand thats what hes doing in this drill kinda brilliant
MMA,not_removed,boxing technique is perfect for the sport of boxing this is mma some aspects of boxing form are the same but not many the stance has to be different the feints are different footwork is different etc perfect boxing technique would get you ruined in high level mma mma striking is different
MMA,not_removed,too soon
MMA,not_removed,i actually kinda like the card i dont like the title but i do like holmde randamie for the same reason i liked holmshevchenko i dont quite like jacareboetsch but i do like that jacare is active and boetsch at least is coming off a stoppage win glover vs cannonier is actually a solid matchup could go either way and could be a big step up for cannonier who had a great outing in his last fight poirier vs miller has the potential to be fight of the night yeah i really dont mind it actually
MMA,not_removed,not to mention the mileage he has on him if he had started fighting at thirty it wouldnt be as bad but with the career he had his body and mind are probably more beat up than he is willing to admit
MMA,not_removed,some would say hes a tortoise
MMA,not_removed,i disagree he has been fighting a long time but he didnt take any damage in most of his fights he has taken damage in his recent fights but he actually doesnt have much mileage for
MMA,not_removed,implying bisping beats romero then anderson leapfrogs jacare but whatever happens i just want to see silva beat the chris i dont care if he cheats takes trt grabs the fence stoolgate whatever as long as he beats weidman
MMA,not_removed,he could beat bisping
MMA,not_removed,he was always the faster man maybe trttor was quicker than him i cant think of anyone else of course the timing was essential but silva was always fast as shit
MMA,not_removed,for sure
MMA,not_removed,regardless he is mostly using his arms and shoulders here you dont need a proper boxing stance to rotate your hips properly something he doesnt do here nbsp that might be because they are working on movement he doesnt care or just that he isnt aware of it or unable to do it anymore cause he has done it properly before and hasnt looked that stiff nbsp saying that mma needs different and needs to be approached differently is true as there are far more factors to consider doesnt mean that you ignore the basic mechanics of throwing a punch
MMA,not_removed,its like ufc lite bullshit main event but fun matchups
MMA,not_removed,most of the damage a fighter like anderson endures comes from training this is specially true on the gym he comes from grueling sparring sessions done on a regular basis for years will wreck your body no matter who you are even normal training will take its toll
MMA,not_removed,i dont know man he was a lot like chuck when he was younger he could eat some bombs and keep going his chin eventually cracked and hes at where hes at now getting dropped twice by bisping if he keeps this up he will end up like chuck
MMA,not_removed,not rooting for one of rmmas golden boys bold move cotton lets see how it pans out for him
MMA,not_removed,he kind of did and prematurely celebrated which cost him the fight bisping made his way to the belt following that fight
MMA,not_removed,could he though he landed a flying knee as a result of bisping erroneously thinking the fight could be stopped to get his mouthpiece it was a particular circumstance that silva took advantage of to drop him bisping made a huge mistake that almost cost him but he recovered and implemented his game plan and won a solid decision i would put my money on bisping in a rematch
MMA,not_removed,doubt it bisping completely out struck him
MMA,not_removed,i see your point bur it was never omg look how fast he throws when i think fast hands i think micheal johnson or alexander emelianenko he used to look like he was on fast forward when he let em fly
MMA,not_removed,those are all fair points on watching it again i notice that they seem to be drilling backward movement and evasive action while throwing weak shots im sure anderson silva knows whether hes throwing arm punches or not and has a reason to drill this way for those seconds or whatever
MMA,not_removed,good point
MMA,not_removed,silva was mmas golden boy long before weidman
MMA,not_removed,dont know why youre getting downvoted its an important piece of information thats often omitted when people discuss this
MMA,not_removed,probably because youre logged on in two places
MMA,not_removed,yeah its happening to me constantly definitely not logged in on two devices but kept getting popups saying i am beyond irritating
MMA,not_removed,doesnt happen with me and i switch between xbox app and pc try logging out on the one youre not watching maybe
MMA,not_removed,nah all good here mate
MMA,not_removed,are you using a vpn or any other proxy
MMA,not_removed,nope
MMA,not_removed,so holly is a cheater because the ref kept standing her up
MMA,not_removed,in the return fight against holm later holm won on points this would imply that objectively holm lost the second fight and mattis was robbed a decision was that the case
MMA,not_removed,what is this shit holly is a cheat because she didnt stay down or
MMA,not_removed,the first fight is infamous for its bad reffing and holm won the second on points seriously watch it hometown judges or no she clearly won mathis complains about her fights with holm in every single interview she gives
MMA,not_removed,like awesome and literally words lose all meaning when they are applied to everything and anyway how bitter do you have to be towards a person you knocked out to still complain about them
MMA,not_removed,the claim is that holly was helped out of the ropes and such basically that the match was fixed and that the only way mattis could get the win was by a clean clear cut knockout
MMA,not_removed,debatable at best most seem to agree it was a solid decision to holm i included it because its part of the statement mattis made far as i can tell the claim seems to be that holm would fight on points and either win legitimately orthe judge would give her the win regardless something that has been alleged andor hinted at by other boxers as well as part of the reason why holm fought almost exclusively in her hometown
MMA,not_removed,i dont disagree on the second fight ill happily admit i dont like holm but this post was more of a this is a ufc fighter so this its somewhat relevant please discuss more than anything i doubt shes cheating in the ufc at least not in the fixed match kinda sense
MMA,not_removed,paddy cant really talk trash after his last fight where he should have lost against a journeyman if you havent watched the fight it was an embarrasing display for pimblett hopefully he has learned from it and doesnt puke after the fight this time
MMA,not_removed,huhuhuhuh nad
MMA,not_removed,pimbletts a dork
MMA,not_removed,i was thinking the same after that shitshow its best to keep your mouth shut and put in a good performance
MMA,not_removed,the dude is hyped as the next conor mcgregor but he doesnt know what a double is for fucks sake
MMA,not_removed,his haircut is more than enough for him not to be able to talk shit he looks like the from children of the corn
MMA,not_removed,a few of them
MMA,not_removed,pimblett had some hype behind him but i wouldnt say it has ever been comparable to mcgregor the hype also pretty much died after this last outing
MMA,not_removed,i think the only person who had been saying he was the next conor mcgregor was paddy himself
MMA,not_removed,apparently in europe hes bigger than conor was during the cage warriors days
MMA,not_removed,mma is bigger in europe than it was thenthanks to conor
MMA,not_removed,how does conor making cage warriors more popular factor into that
MMA,not_removed,europe is very big and diverse im not from the british isles but im scandinavian and havent noticed any special hype behind him hes probably popular in liverpool but i dont now how many know of him outside of the regional scene except hardcore fans
MMA,not_removed,nah regional promotions get no national coverage in britain only mma youll hear of is the mainstream ufc fighters like conor bisping rousey etc
MMA,not_removed,thank you only reason he is getting any hype at all is because the profile of not only mma but the cage warriors brand has risen massively thanks to conor
MMA,not_removed,savage
MMA,not_removed,it amazes me too she just stood there zero movement what the fuck does he teach her
MMA,not_removed,why nsfw
MMA,not_removed,ryan hall upboat
MMA,not_removed,so theres no thumbnail for mobile users which could spoil it
MMA,not_removed,oops i thought i had to tag it that way to get the rogan face over the thumbnail
MMA,not_removed,well dana was wrong because aldo is ecstatic about the news
MMA,not_removed,its sad but dana doesnt care jose has never moved the needle and pulled out of title fights theyll do max vs frankie or pettis for the title and the division will move on chad will probably come back and be right back in title contention
MMA,not_removed,mystic dana
MMA,not_removed,its kind of insane to think about what ufc could look like if conor decided to shoot a movie or something instead aldo vs holloway for the fw title khabib vs alvarez for the lw title woodley vs wonderboy for the ww title maybe im in the purist minority but i would be much more excited for that card and it would cost the organization a fraction to put it on im certainly not saying that i dont appreciate watching conor fight but when you look at that card from a conorless perspective it really shows how neutered the fighters at the top of these divisions are
MMA,not_removed,im going with mcgregor now i still talk about aldo but i dont actually care in any way whatsoever dana white
MMA,not_removed,i truly believe that dana wanted conor to fight aldo next but the powers that be overruled him
MMA,not_removed,it seemed like dana always had a soft spot for aldo but
MMA,not_removed,well both conor and mma journalists have a point what is conors incentive for fighting aldo again as a fan id love to see a full fight between them at least a round but if i was conor how can i top seconds there is no better outcome than what already happened now if he defeats him soundly both standing up and on the ground hed probably get more respect and cred but if he loses it costs him a lot more i want to see this fight but i just dont expect it to happen any time soon if at all
MMA,not_removed,lets remember how many fights aldo has pulled out of this is a huge event for the ufc and from a business standpoint cant take a risk like that
MMA,not_removed,i know jose is a legend and all that good stuff but why cant he be content to reign over until conor is back it doesnt matter who you are getting starched in seconds is never ever going to get you immediate rematch
MMA,not_removed,you spoke with dana and who are you
MMA,not_removed,neither has dj but aldo and dj are goat candidates
MMA,not_removed,pulled out because of injury
MMA,not_removed,i think he actually cares just realizes that this is a business first i guess we will see though if dana does care for jose he will make sure the ufc lets him out of the contract dana said that conor holding that belt for so long is not fair to the division before they announced the fight with eddie
MMA,not_removed,i see your point but thats you and me there is no denying that conor brings in huge numbers
MMA,not_removed,i dont think dana ever wanted conor to fight aldo to begin with
MMA,not_removed,last time aldo tried to move up to lw to challenge for the title against pettis dana told him he would have to vacate the fw belt first because dana didnt want a division champ holding up the most stacked divisions
MMA,not_removed,incentive the champion of a division is fighting and its not against the interimchampion if this was actually a sport conor wouldnt be able to pick his matchups but whatever hes the draw and all that bullshit
MMA,not_removed,incentive to keep his belt its like saying whats the incentive for the superbowl champions to play again next season dana has properly fucked the fw division now creating an interim belt because the title holder is fit but refuses to defend his belt
MMA,not_removed,conorjose would be a huge financial success people are dismissive of a rematch because of the second ko and i guess thats fair to a certain extent but the ko can be used a promotional motivator on joses side i seriously doubt a rematch goes anything like the first fight maybe a first round finish i can get behind but there will be exchanges attempted takedowns lateral movement kicks etc i would watch the fuck out of a rematch
MMA,not_removed,i dont really understand the downvotes here nothing you said is wrong yeah it would be nice for conor to actually defend his belt i think more hardcore fans want to see that over alvarez but from the money making standpoint both him and the ufc probably make more with his whole two division champ thing fairness and sportsmanship are pretty obviously not the most important things at play here
MMA,not_removed,getting starched in seconds is never ever going to get you immediate rematch getting tapped in two rounds by a guy who was vacationing when he got the call days before does though
MMA,not_removed,except he already beat edgar and won the interim title so it wouldnt be an immediate rematch
MMA,not_removed,if hes actually mark la monica hes a sports writer google is your friend
MMA,not_removed,if anything khabib has way more reason to be pissed than aldo hes dominated every opponent never looked close to losing and has taken short notice fights after his opponents have pulled out and hes not even an interim champ
MMA,not_removed,baaahahaha you son of a bitch mcskills
MMA,not_removed,people keep spouting that line without the addition of injury one of them being a fucking motorcycle accident it sucks that he pulled out but aside from his first scheduled fight he eventually fought the assigned challenger as expected anyhow injuries happen and when youre champion and want to stay champion its fucking stupid of you to fight hurt its sort of bullshit for a business to punish you for things beyond your control such as matters of health even though depending on where it is in the states its legal that said it sucks that aldos ufc run over the last years has been plagued with injuries i can see why as a promoter the ufc prefers an english speaking technically discrimination noninjury prone champion
MMA,not_removed,well uh do you feel the same way about henderson getting a shot at bisping for the mw belt
MMA,not_removed,i get that im putting myself in his shoes and i see no reason for him to do it he just wants to make a lot of money he doesnt care about anything else
MMA,not_removed,he seems to have kept his belt so far there is a difference between the ufc forcing him to fight aldo versus him wanting to fight aldo he has no incentive to want to fight aldo
MMA,not_removed,yes this actually is me thanks for googling
MMA,not_removed,thanks
MMA,not_removed,and aldo has only defended the belt times in fw division only thats more times than the current champion edgar mendes and holloway combined
MMA,not_removed,hes dominated every opponent never looked close to losing spoken like someone who gets their mma knowledge from reading other comments everyone knows he lost the tibau fight
MMA,not_removed,that fight against tibaut could have and maybe should have gone the other way personally im feeling more for aldo right now i am most excited for the fight we ended up getting though
MMA,not_removed,i dont get why khabib hasnt fought an actual prospect in his division to prove all the shit he talks about being the best
MMA,not_removed,nice try khabib
MMA,not_removed,back to youtube
MMA,not_removed,the ufc offered bisping that fight
MMA,not_removed,ya i think that fight is bullshit as well should be jacare but whatever
MMA,not_removed,yeah it makes sense for any fighter to win a fight then run away from ever having a rematch or defending their belts why take the chance but thats why you need a good match maker who makes sure the integrity of the sport isnt thrown away for good ppv numbers sadly dana has back flipped and theyve traded integrity for money
MMA,not_removed,better to do that than run off at the mouth first cheers
MMA,not_removed,youre welcome
MMA,not_removed,easy there i definitely wouldnt say he lost
MMA,not_removed,absolutely not
MMA,not_removed,yeah everyone i guess thats how he won the fight
MMA,not_removed,yeah he was busy fighting nohopers like raphael dos nachos or some shit
MMA,not_removed,well we are talking about fairness here arent we is it fair how aldono is it fair that henderson is getting a title shot over jacareno if you havent noticed its not about fairness its about business
MMA,not_removed,what do you think this means and well see what happens with jose aldo im sure hes not gonna be thrilled does this sound like someone who is about to get a title shot
MMA,not_removed,lol you conor fanboys are really too much these are his own words youre upset cause im repeating what he says how long was i going back and forth with jose that must have been a twoyear build up he pulled out last minute i continued to fight someone else then we rescheduled twoyear roundtheworld deal with that boy and then he stepped in and i beat him in seconds mcgregor said via fox sports its hard for me to get excited about that especially after his last performance it was a decision he didnt go out and get it he didnt go out and get it like i wanted him to get it so i dont know well see
MMA,not_removed,oh i had no idea at all not like its his only decent win ever and it was years ago if only one of his fans would post about it in every thread then i may have known
MMA,not_removed,edit is it fair how aldo is treated
MMA,not_removed,well this particular comment you replied to was about the champion picking his fights not about who deserves the shot or fairness of it edit also arguably it wouldnt be fair considering jacare did lose to romero even if it was overturned usada decided it was a tainted supplement
MMA,not_removed,conor fanboys get a clue buddy all my comments are about how aldo deserves a rematch ive actually been bitching about conor and his ufc shit and avoiding title defence for a while now i was just agreeing with the conor fan that sure from conors view of his empire hed rather win a belt and run than defend it thats why we need a decent match maker that forces him to defend wake up mate
MMA,not_removed,still doesnt justify a guy not even ranked in the top given a title shot anyone above henderson is more deserving but i still love the match up the alverezmcgregor match up
MMA,not_removed,wake up this isnt my opinion im repeating what conor says keep bitching its not going to do a fucking thing you need to wake up this is reality
MMA,not_removed,thats it conor creates his own reality and people seem to be happy to just go along with it
MMA,not_removed,mvp is a video editors dream
MMA,not_removed,the question is can he do that in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,why not just use your hands
MMA,not_removed,he and bellator arent interested in finding out hes looking to make a career as a sideshow and guy that teaches seminars bellator is fine with that if they wanted him in the bellator title picture he would have been fighting real fights a year ago hes not going to fight rory hes not going to fight koreshkov hes just going to fight guys who stand in front of him and wait
MMA,not_removed,hes got his chequered croatian shorts on someones getting left leg cemetery
MMA,not_removed,all the pokemon go walking has made crocop into a physical specimen
MMA,not_removed,all natty for sure
MMA,not_removed,of course he does no usada no cry

MMA,not_removed,its happening
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,well he was at a boxing event recently probably talked to some people
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,and they dont even know who conor is let alone watch mma
MMA,not_removed,i actually loved counterpunch it was awesome when they did it with tj dillashaw and dominick cruz
MMA,not_removed,hell yeah was wondering if they were still going to air this
MMA,not_removed,yes
MMA,not_removed,jones is such a threefaced bastard on one hand he tries to be this underdog guy who sorta had this shit childhood and he was so poor and all of that shit but then he goes ahead and acts like a spoiled little brat he put is freaking forehead on dcs forehead from above him and proceeds to tell him he touched him before and that he doesnt have to listen to his childish shit this feude is totally and only on jones side i actually believe dc would have no problem with him if jones just stopped acting like a year old for a minute but because he does it over and over and over again he just ends up dragging dc to his level its so weird to watch that guy must have the lowest emotional intelligence and empathy i have ever seen in a fighter

MMA,not_removed,you cant be done talking dummy
MMA,not_removed,meh dc definitely doesnt like him because hes a threat they are both super competitive they both have the same winning attitude and they hate each other for it
MMA,not_removed,i think dc is pretty clearly the child in the feud remember it started because jon jokingly told dc he bet he could take him down for some reason this drove dc into such a rage that hes had a bizarre venditta against jon since
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,in the live thread someone said they were at the fights and a bunch of security guards beat up and escorted out a group of guys who messed with lawler or did something maybe the same incident
MMA,not_removed,it was visible on broadcast a little bit i noticed securitys and some of lawlers team look into the stands on their left as they were running past it looked like some event security broke off of walking out with lawler and went into the crowd
MMA,not_removed,did not see this on my broadcast but my interest is piqued
MMA,not_removed,that was me haha i was hoping someone else had a better view and could provide some info
MMA,not_removed,lawler came out of a different side of the arena than everyone else too he was the only one all night to come out of that side and like i said the dudes that got kicked out were celebrating really hard with ellenberger when he won whole thing was crazy weird
MMA,not_removed,ah shit
MMA,not_removed,its not a loophole position before submission you are sacrificing top position to roll for an ankle lock like that even if you are better on the ground you will expend a ton of energy doing that
MMA,not_removed,its tiring thats the drawback for a rolling ankle lock youre more likely to lose if you tire faster than the opponent forcing a technique by spamming it isnt the best plan being unpredictable is best it was only a good gameplan against wonderboy because he didnt want anything to do with the ground game thats why rory did it times and failed times calling it a loophole is a stretch its merely that certain techniques will work better against different opponents or will complement your own style well for instance grapplers who learn kicking techniques wont have to worry much about being taken down and can be reckless with their kicks thats one the biggest advantages you can have i think
MMA,not_removed,spam rolling ankle locks on an opponent you can spam weak thigh kicks get a higher dps and receive better a mmr from the judges frankly id just zone with hadoukens but some characters cant do that
MMA,not_removed,i would like to point out that rory lost that fight so it cant be that big of a loophole as to your question the only universally agreed as bullshit loophole is the points of contact make a fighter downed a standing fighter touching the canvas with a hand to prevent knees and kicks to the head is absurd
MMA,not_removed,i think you played a little to much ufc when a fighter uses the same move over and over without mixing it up his opponent will easy adjust either by countering it or by simply moving out of harms way
MMA,not_removed,youre aware of the concept of energy correct attempting combat somersaults for minutes is going to be absolutely brutal
MMA,not_removed,hence the one fc ruleset
MMA,not_removed,rolling ankle locks i didnt catch that fight so im not sure what youre referring to op
MMA,not_removed,reminds me of rich franklins advice to serra on tuf to take a knee approach as you cant get kicked in the face
MMA,not_removed,loophole lol if someone is doing an imanari roll and you tried to soccer kick them you are far more likely to hurt your foot or give up the take down than you are to injure your opponent usually the less someone knows about the rules fighting the more vocal they become also rolling ankle lock lol i suppose it is possible to straight foot lock someone from the imanari position but it is way more likely to result in a heel hook
MMA,not_removed,hell against a grappler they might even bellyflop on top of you and take side your back
MMA,not_removed,bronze scrub
MMA,not_removed,yes that is the only universally agreed as bullshit loophole matt hamill
MMA,not_removed,whats with the downvotes ive been doing nogo grappling for years and i have never heard that term before and am asking for clarification
MMA,not_removed,what was up with that was he just screwing around does he hate serra i dont get it
MMA,not_removed,imo if youre not trying to reverse crab off an imanari up to a full crucifix and then down into a twister youre just an amateur any way s
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah i forgot all about the to elbows point to you sir
MMA,not_removed,sure these people are referring to the imanari roll which would lead to a heel hook more commonly than an ankle lock
MMA,not_removed,that thing rory did times in the fight where he did a diving roll onto the ground trying to grab wonderboys leg and apply an anklelock thats what theyre calling a rolling ankle lock you rarely see them in mma from people who arent ankle lock masters which rorys bjj coach danaher is and youre gettign downvotes because if you saw the fight those three times rory unsuccessfully dove to the floor kind of stick out
MMA,not_removed,i dont train but i thought it was called an iminari roll to ankle lock kind of like ryan hall did on tuf
MMA,not_removed,may as well walk around on your knees
MMA,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing if it was indeed an imanari roll would be very odd for for someone to go for an ankle lock in mma if the heel hook is available
MMA,not_removed,if you saw the fight which is why i said i didnt see the fight and was asking for clarification
MMA,not_removed,it is not that the heel hook is stronger than the ankle lock it is that the position technique itself sets up a heel hook much easier than an ankle lock imo anyways anytime ive tried the roll i did not go for an ankle lock and that is usually my go to leg lock is the straight foot lock
MMA,not_removed,a diving reaching takedown with a roll at the end specifically to grab the opponents lead leg and attempt an anklefoot submission
MMA,not_removed,i would respectfully disagree the heel hook is superior to a straight ankle lock as a nogimma submission in several ways properly secured the heel hook is much more difficult to escape it provides an immediate threat that has to be addressed compared to the relatively ample amount of daylight you are provided when fighting off even a well secured ankle light you can see the superior effectiveness of the heel hook over the ankle in its use at the highest level of both grappling and mma as far as leg locks go heel hooks are far more commonly applied and finished than ankle locks its not for nothing that when leglocking specialists like tonon hall cummings and palhares go for a leg lock they go for the heel hook
MMA,not_removed,oh i agree that the heel hook is stronger than the ankle lock but the point is that the imanari roll sets up a heel hook technically to go for the ankle lock would be adding steps unnecessarily it would be the equivalent of having someones back and going for an armbar over an rnc it isnt necessarily a bad idea but it makes more sense to go for the rnc from that position also the rnc is higher percentage so just go for that anyways so ya not a rolling ankle lock imo
MMA,not_removed,lmao crocop just fucking everyones shit up in japan
MMA,not_removed,wow that is one big motherfucker
MMA,not_removed,dont underestimate knees
MMA,not_removed,thought that belly would at least block some damage
MMA,not_removed,a knee so vicious not even pounds of belly fat could stop it cro cop is still a beast
MMA,not_removed,pride crocop is best crocop
MMA,not_removed,god damn mirko is jacked and glorious in his old age
MMA,not_removed,liver shot
MMA,not_removed,i love rizin
MMA,not_removed,the co main event podcast is going to be devastated barutonnoooooooo
MMA,not_removed,what sort of is rizin paying
MMA,not_removed,those commentators were fucking terrible replace them with mike goldberg and bas rutten immediately
MMA,not_removed,naruto didnt teach him well
MMA,not_removed,nice divelol
MMA,not_removed,wow that guy really has no business being there
MMA,not_removed,yes and go watch literally any liver shot ko and look where they clinch weird how youre so adamant about it being the liver when literally no one else agrees with you
MMA,not_removed,no wonder ufc took over these japan shows are for circus clowns
MMA,not_removed,this whole thing is rigged watching this and gabi and what i pointed out days ago you guys are so silly thinking this is real
MMA,not_removed,crocoppuuuuuu
MMA,not_removed,pow right in the breadbasket which also happens to be where all the breadsticks went
MMA,not_removed,which one love me some juiced up cro cop
MMA,not_removed,its probably from all the sushi i bet he eats now
MMA,not_removed,solar plexus
MMA,not_removed,the winners checks said yen for winner so thats like in winning bonus not sure what crocops contract amount was i remember reading they offered fedor that network money pays well i hope they can steal some ufc talent and actually become a ufc alternative like pride was back in the day
MMA,not_removed,it did look like the affects were worse than the shot should have been
MMA,not_removed,good luck dude you cant get thru to these zealots its like telling a flat earth shill that nasa is legit and the bible is not a book of facts
MMA,not_removed,get that mother fucker some xxxxl scuba gear eh
MMA,not_removed,that guys name ronda rousey
MMA,not_removed,he does this is mma fight sumo champ pounds and probably the only pound dude that has proven he can go hard for rounds
MMA,not_removed,yea i mean the guy is fighting a long time vet in cro cop but he can hold on to his own as he shown in his last fight
MMA,not_removed,hes actually pretty decent
MMA,not_removed,he beat tsuyoshi kohsaka in the quarter finals who hasnt really fought since and is but has a record of with fights against fedor big nog randy couture mark hunt so idk like baruto can beat some guys
MMA,not_removed,stop watching then
MMA,not_removed,its not news that screwy things happen in japanese promotions gonna tell us that wwe isnt real next
MMA,not_removed,hey man is this the joe warren from bellator commentating
MMA,not_removed,some of those were my bread sticks this is fucking bullshit
MMA,not_removed,ive never taken a hard shot to the solar plexus and i dont recall ever seeing a tko like that before is the pain comparable to a liver shot or was this just barutos inexperience showing and he couldnt fight through it
MMA,not_removed,its entirely possible that this was legit and its entirely plausible based on what has been said about pride and fighting in japan in general that the fight was fixed i can say from experience that the seemingly weakest body shots can really fuck you up if they land right and at the right time
MMA,not_removed,you made my morning
MMA,not_removed,he also has a win over legendary kickboxing peter aerts baruto is a legit opponent for japanese freak show fights a lot more legit than some of the guys pride threw into the ring back in the day
MMA,not_removed,its fun even if scripted
MMA,not_removed,your statement is showing you understand the screwy things gonna happen so obviously the statement wasnt directed at you but all the people defending the events being percent legit
MMA,not_removed,yes
MMA,not_removed,same guy he actually started out in japan
MMA,not_removed,bas has quite a few solar plexus tkos
MMA,not_removed,theres plenty of fighters that have been finished by shots to the solar plexus most notably would be anderson silva finishing stephen bonnar and chael sonnen in their second fight yea i say the pain level is up there with taking a liver shot neither of those shots i would like to experience
MMA,not_removed,this hurts really bad but id say the liver is worse both terrible pains but too different feelings the liver feels kinda like a stab and the plexus is like getting the life kicked out of u for a second not inexperience if cro cop hits anyone with this perfectly their going down
MMA,not_removed,ive taken a hard kick there once during competition through a pad and it make me want to puke it certainly can incapacitate i was technically fighting a weight class below though and terrible
MMA,not_removed,you get hit and instantly cant breathe whereas a liver shot you just feel like your insides are failing
MMA,not_removed,it had to be a liver shot dumb shit warren said it was solar plexus though
MMA,not_removed,not scripted just mismatched
MMA,not_removed,thanks man hes so annoying
MMA,not_removed,also overeem vs lesnar
MMA,not_removed,thatll do it haha im now dont train much anymore just enough to feel like i can still take the avg joe easily and dont miss getting beaten up
MMA,not_removed,the replay looked like solar plexus to me but hard to tell for sure
MMA,not_removed,this is just getting more ridiculous each match im entertained but what ive been watching is beyond mismatches you guys need to get over this pride was real shit
MMA,not_removed,he sounds like a paula poundstone impersonator
MMA,not_removed,maybe the local thai boxing gym can help you out with some hands on learning in a clinch class
MMA,not_removed,these current fights are pretty ridiculous with some dives taken but pride was as real as fighting gets i have no idea how you can think otherwise
MMA,not_removed,serious question do you wear glasses
MMA,not_removed,youre objectively wrong dude thats not even subjective hed be holding his side for the liver not clenching his belly in the upper middle or you know where his fucking solar plexus are
MMA,not_removed,httpwwwcancernetsitescancernetfilesvignettelivercreditlargejpg
MMA,not_removed,also do you not realize how liver kos come from a shot to the side not through the center can you give me one example of a liver ko where theyre either clinching their front or got hit from a straight forward shot
MMA,not_removed,yes and go watch literally any liver shot ko and look where they clinch weird how youre so adamant about it being the liver when literally no one else agrees with you
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,once you realize neither knee nor the liver has a surface area of cm you will know youre wrong until then i do enjoy the anatomy lesson from you are you a professor or something
MMA,not_removed,aaaaand that proves youve given up trying to argue your stance good try though bud
MMA,not_removed,oh heres another video clearly explaining the difference man you couldve just admitted you were wrong when evidence first came up i can always respect a captain going down with his ship though
MMA,not_removed,what does that have to do with literally anything the surface area of the knee or liver youre just going off the deep end now rofl
MMA,not_removed,i always use random youtube videos to study thanks for this
MMA,not_removed,im laughing too
MMA,not_removed,what do you use instead you havent backed up your stance even once haha
MMA,not_removed,laughing at yourself do you genuinely think youre right here or are you just trolling this whole sub the commentators and all the media disagree with you the pretentiousness it must require to think youre right and they have no idea what theyre talking about
MMA,not_removed,haha
MMA,not_removed,wrist control
MMA,not_removed,one of the best moments in mma for me
MMA,not_removed,there was more respect in that single handshake than he got from the thousands of fans sitting cage side at ufc
MMA,not_removed,the world needs more sakuraba
MMA,not_removed,im young
MMA,not_removed,win or lose helio always had the biggest smile on his face after fights just watch when royce lost to hughes
MMA,not_removed,helio was so dignified it really was a beautiful moment the head of the gracie clan shakes hands with the gracie hunter after watching him beat his son and you can tell that theres nothing but respect between them
MMA,not_removed,sakuraba submitting royce would have been better imo
MMA,not_removed,just not in the ring
MMA,not_removed,thats helio gracie the godfather of brazilian jiu jitsu and one of the most important names in martial arts history he is shaking sakurabas hand imo the best japanese fighter ever who was know as the gracie killer the gracies had a huge rivalry with sakuraba at the time since that nickname came after saku made a living of beating a lot of gracie family members who at the time were deemed as almost unbeatable due to their amazing jiu jitsu if im not mistaken that gif is taken after the epic fight between royce gracie and sakuraba and its a cool sign of respect seeing sakuraba shaking helios hand after having a fight with his son
MMA,not_removed,and saku was going to fight rickson gracie the top fighter of all the gracies after beating royce but his son died and the fight never happened
MMA,not_removed,helio once said something along the lines of it is not my sons who are good it is jiu jitsu which is good he pretty much got to watch his influence on the martial arts be enacted upon his own son what a strange experience that must have been
MMA,not_removed,my background on my phone is the gracies throwing in the towel if there was a clear pic of this handshake it would be my new background
MMA,not_removed,thanks bro
MMA,not_removed,isnt carlos gracie the godfather
MMA,not_removed,sakurabas son or gracies
MMA,not_removed,there are competing lines of the legacy as i recall dont quote me helio was the kid brother who was weak and asthmatic but watched his older brothers training and was the one who figured out the details of controlling larger opponents
MMA,not_removed,sure but helios contributions as innovator and family champion loom pretty large gracie jiujitsu is usually cited as a collaborative effort among the elder gracies and ive never seen anyone get too grumpy about who did what
MMA,not_removed,rockson gracie ricksons son died in it absolutely ruined rickson for a long time as they were inseparable a really devastating loss for the gracie family theres still some degree of conjecture over exactly what happened but from what i recall they found his body off the side of a road somewhere near a motorcycle
MMA,not_removed,ricksons son
MMA,not_removed,thats because a lot if people that have no clue about mma but like cm punk are placing bets on him
MMA,not_removed,its a nice payoff if he miraculously surprises everyone with a win im never keen on laying down to win on a favorite
MMA,not_removed,youre probably right but we also have no idea what hell bring to the table and gall has two career fights which is two more than cmp though im not a pro wrestling fan but i am intrigued about what mr brooks can present
MMA,not_removed,hell present his chin to micky gall who will then get an easy first round knockout seriously his sparring looks atrocious
MMA,not_removed,i think we have a pretty fair idea of what he will bring to the table as a year old average to slightly above average athlete with numerous previous injuries and no formal martial arts training

MMA,not_removed,as much of a troll this is its still a complete and utter unfunny shitpost for effort and thats being generous
MMA,not_removed,and its gone
MMA,not_removed,â¬ thats pretty fuckin cheap
MMA,not_removed,still free in the ukireland with a bt sport subscription
MMA,not_removed,when i was a kid i always wished that my parents would get sky afn american forces network only had six channels and i was so jealous of kids who had sky
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,this is not that great to be honest most folks dont hav sky so in the situation the ufc has here in germany which is that almost nobody knows about them they should have gone for something that would give them more exposure if theyre on sky they will most likely stay unknown
MMA,not_removed,wait so one must have a subscription to sky in order to watch ppv or its possible to just get the ppv by itself
MMA,not_removed,you can now order ufc on sky
MMA,not_removed,yes compared to your bucks the ppv model has never established itself in germany if ufc ppvs cost more than euros nobody would buy it
MMA,not_removed,not for the time theyre on at
MMA,not_removed,isnt bt gonna be quid a month soon i have it for free with eir broadband thank fuck
MMA,not_removed,but it also means that you cannot watch any live ufc card on fight pass anymore the smaller cards used to be uploaded the next day too but bt put a stop to that like it was so good last july to watch rda vs alvarez since in the morning before work on the app on my phone when it only aired an hour or two before now even fight pass exlusive cards are no longer exclusive or even n fight pass
MMA,not_removed,my parents paid for sky when my dad was stationed in england couldnt handle anymore of the afn commercials
MMA,not_removed,it used to only be posh families that had sky when i was a lad but we had even fewer terrestrial channels like we had the two national channels and both bbc and and then a few more were added over the years
MMA,not_removed,where were you stationed
MMA,not_removed,you can still order it on ranfighting but weve got no other ppv option rather than sky i would like to see fight nights for free on sport
MMA,not_removed,you must be a sky subscriber to order sky select content but you can still order it via ranfighting and watch it via app or browser
MMA,not_removed,nowhere in europe really has stong ppv market uk is the only one and its still very cheap comparatively
MMA,not_removed,yeah nobody in europe is paying sixty quid for a show that kicks off at if it came with a gram of coke or at the very least a large coffee then itd certainly sweeten the deal otherwise its morning torrents all the way
MMA,not_removed,a month we almost pay that for all of our sky packages combined
MMA,not_removed,i hated them while i was there but id take them now over liberty mutual ads ugh
MMA,not_removed,bbc and you west brit scum we would get the two rtÃ©s and half tuned in
MMA,not_removed,my father was stationed at ramstein
MMA,not_removed,can confirm am european didnt even know what ppv meant until not too long ago
MMA,not_removed,market rates also on sky box office uk highly promoted boxing ppvs are typically between â¬â¬ maypac was â¬ im sure theyd charge more if they could
MMA,not_removed,thats just my internet with comcast kill me san francisco kill me
MMA,not_removed,yeah but i mean talking trash doesnt mean much if you dont back it up
MMA,not_removed,thats pretty cool as a huge fan of both of them its such a treat to see this i shall beat up my printer as tribute
MMA,not_removed,ive always enjoyed nortons standup but i can only take the self deprecation in small doses ive really grown to love serra and especially the back and forth between serranorton you can really tell theyve become friends like when serras add kicks in hard and all he says is bring me back and norton knew exactly where to bookmark to drag him back to i do wish they would have their facts a little more in order sometimes or chris the producer would have this shit at the ready because they do mess things up a decent bit like who someone has fought and what not definitely listen to any episode dana is on those ones are always good also the live broadcast with forrest griffin and don frye was hilarious
MMA,not_removed,anyone else enjoy this podcast way more than the fighter and the kid
MMA,not_removed,cowboy cerrone has become that guy to me where if i see hes doing a podcast instant download
MMA,not_removed,sucks so bad that norton is on this show
MMA,not_removed,does anyone have the link to the full episode
MMA,not_removed,they need a young jamie or producer chris needs to train with young jamie
MMA,not_removed,ive never listened to fighter and the kid and dont intend to but i find matt pretty funny and enjoy his stories
MMA,not_removed,this latest tfatk with bob saget was the worst one yet callen and rogan have created a monster by constantly feeding into brendans ego
MMA,not_removed,absolutely i like bryan cuz hes funny but brendans a tool most of the time on the other hand jim has years of experience with oa and matts uncensored stream of consciousness rants are hilarious
MMA,not_removed,serra is the main reason why i listen to it that other guy creeps me out
MMA,not_removed,ive watched every episode of the jre every episode of the icehouse chronicles and i used to upload episodes of the church of whats happening now to youtube this is my new favorite podcast i literally check every day for a new episode and am legitimately sad when there isnt one the only thing that beats this now is eddie bravococo episodes of the jre matt sera is a fucking animal arf arf arf
MMA,not_removed,its sad but tfatk has a way better producer chris sucks and is constantly fucking up the show it makes ufc unleashed sound amateurish
MMA,not_removed,whys everyone compare the two theyre not even close to the same like them or not brendan and bryan have great chemistry serra and norton have next to none tfatk is pretty much maxim magazine in a podcast unfiltered is a huge commercial for the ufc theyre not even close to the same podcast
MMA,not_removed,use literally any podcast player or a google search
MMA,not_removed,this post is literally the link to the full episode
MMA,not_removed,yeah brendan is fucking awful now the early tfatks were good but that early success lead to a huge ego in brendan and now he carries that ego everywhere as a result i cant watch tfatk anymore even though i really like bryan and wish brendan would just being a fucking douche all the time so i could actually bare it
MMA,not_removed,thats kind of nortons thing hes made an entire career out of being a depraved weirdo
MMA,not_removed,i like whenever serra stutters he starts barking in order to reset
MMA,not_removed,check out his character uncle paul if you wanna be creeped out further
MMA,not_removed,no comain event
MMA,not_removed,shut up brendan
MMA,not_removed,ev sucks a fat one with audio levels but at least hes entertaining chris is too much of an introvert but at least he can produce
MMA,not_removed,brendan and bryan have chemistry because they are sexually attracted to each other
MMA,not_removed,matt and jimmy have done like shows compared to for tfatk id expect them to have better chemistry
MMA,not_removed,no its not its the highlights
MMA,not_removed,then stop consuming their bullshit it wont change as long as he sees the view count keeping steady i cant stand the guy and as a logical result i wont listen
MMA,not_removed,i saw him as a stray dog from oa but hes grown on me he is just a weird dude in a likeable way they way he hyperboles his innabilities and faults is funny and relatable i specially like that whenever dana is mentioned or around he starts brown nosing for his life
MMA,not_removed,hes entertaining to you
MMA,not_removed,because bryan is sexualy attracted to bredun and worships him
MMA,not_removed,they had better chemistry on day one imo
MMA,not_removed,dude cmon the first player on the page is the full podcast
MMA,not_removed,ive stopped watching for a while now i tune in every now and again to see if it got better and it never has problem is now brendan is on all the fight companions and i have to stop watching those now for that same reason lol feel bad for bryan callen though its so obvious he is over brendans shit but has no choice but to suck it up because they are so far deep
MMA,not_removed,check out his podcast
MMA,not_removed,hes gone full retard
MMA,not_removed,nah im good
MMA,not_removed,i dont get it this is exactly how i remembered it going down
MMA,not_removed,original didnt think anyone could make it any better but they did

MMA,not_removed,i still look at this every so often and its incredible
MMA,not_removed,httpimgurcomgalleryfgcuate
MMA,not_removed,this comment requires a reddit plusâ¢ account to view
MMA,not_removed,the original looks more unrealistic
MMA,not_removed,i think the might be some kinda studio effects
MMA,not_removed,he added in points that is literally all op did doing gods work god bless you god
MMA,not_removed,after a case of beer on a cool summer night this is how cowboy explains how it went down to those gathered around the bonfire while roasting marshmallows
MMA,not_removed,i think he just sharpened it up because when you slow down the original footage its all blurry and shitty
MMA,not_removed,donald ricearoni
MMA,not_removed,just slowing it down for those who couldnt keep up
MMA,not_removed,that is absurd
MMA,not_removed,is there a regular speed version of this anywhere ive seen it so many times in slowmo but never in regular mo
MMA,not_removed,cowboy makes mma look like street fighter
MMA,not_removed,that looked like a movie scene where the one dude has super speed so they show the whole event in slowmo except for the super speed guy moving at regular speed like the quicksilver scene from xmen dotfp
MMA,not_removed,beautiful four piece there so damn mesmerizing i must have watched it times
MMA,not_removed,did he stop because he didnt want to severly hurt the guy legitimate question it looked like he could have gotten him in a back choke hold disclaimer i know nothing about the sport
MMA,not_removed,i love ricks face after that combo lands its like seeing a clown holding packages of hot dogs ride a unicycle down the street its the diddid that just happen face
MMA,not_removed,did the fight end shortly after this
MMA,not_removed,damnnn
MMA,not_removed,still dont understand how he wasnt out cold after that combo
MMA,not_removed,patiently waiting for a lauzon edition d
MMA,not_removed,thanks dude i would love for those guys to see this cerrone being on the podcast was good timing my if you want to see more
MMA,not_removed,should really be sending them to jamie he would notify rogan and cerrone
MMA,not_removed,wouldve been nice to have when they were recording joe rogans podcast earlier today
MMA,not_removed,i just did my part
MMA,not_removed,wow i expected him to collapse on the kick
MMA,not_removed,did my part tweeted to jamievernon hopefully enough of us do it and get you that much deserved karma op
MMA,not_removed,lmao hahaha
MMA,not_removed,happy to not disappoint haha
MMA,not_removed,thanks bro appreciate that
MMA,not_removed,can you save me the searching
MMA,not_removed,thanks bro
MMA,not_removed,holy shit thats sick
MMA,not_removed,baby we did it got us to the front page break out the red panties
MMA,not_removed,its a shame that someone gave op gold when you could have given him platinum
MMA,not_removed,upvotes in an hour that didnt take long
MMA,not_removed,man love to hear that thanks man
MMA,not_removed,shh
MMA,not_removed,not enough meta for their front page
MMA,not_removed,this makes highqualitygifs look like walmartgifs
MMA,not_removed,yea he posted it there so hes now on the front page twice its amazing
MMA,not_removed,yeah but rhighqualitygifs is like added subtitles and nothing else cant even compare that shit with ops work
MMA,not_removed,haha thanks bro appreciate it
MMA,not_removed,break out the red panties we did it babies made us rich
MMA,not_removed,its weird im not totally familiar with bill burr but he definitely sounds like a boston version of michael j fox lol
MMA,not_removed,dude that would be amazing maybe one day lol thanks
MMA,not_removed,are you the andy wang
MMA,not_removed,baby we done it break out the red panties
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,he was supposed to be super saiyan the whole fight but i ran out of time takes forever to animate
MMA,not_removed,he went
MMA,not_removed,its perfect
MMA,not_removed,in progress d
MMA,not_removed,thanks bro
MMA,not_removed,thats a kenny florian quote if ever i heard one
MMA,not_removed,thanks man tons of roto i masked out the back using a clean background i made in photoshop for some parts i redrew whole body parts frame by frame in ps basically this was a giant mess that luckily came out ok lol
MMA,not_removed,thanks dude i went both ways with it i wanted to have him super saiyan throughout the whole fight but my time is very limited these days
MMA,not_removed,thought it wasnt be there boiii ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
MMA,not_removed,rsupersaiyangifs
MMA,not_removed,unreal the reaction to it has been amazing o
MMA,not_removed,thanks adobe after effects
MMA,not_removed,thanks
MMA,not_removed,since cerrone doesnt have a moustache maybe just his eyebrows would turn
MMA,not_removed,it reached the top of rall
MMA,not_removed,thanks dude
MMA,not_removed,i think thatd make it much harder to animate much more effects would have to be used for a much longer time
MMA,not_removed,i think thatd make it much harder to animate much more effects would have to be used for a much longer time
MMA,not_removed,i plan to
MMA,not_removed,thats crazy if true o
MMA,not_removed,i second this
MMA,not_removed,serious video game shit it was like stenson in the final round of the british just impossible in real life
MMA,not_removed,says the guy who mentions but does not provide the source i am a dirty hypocrite
MMA,not_removed,nah i remember seeing it live
MMA,not_removed,well thats perfect as long as it is over
MMA,not_removed,self bless yourself god
MMA,not_removed,whats even more absurd is he didnt go to sleep the hits you dont see coming rattle you or more and its usually lights out this guy didnt see the last at least
MMA,not_removed,here also httpsyoutubecejrbeykrou
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,hmmmcerrone vs mcgregor
MMA,not_removed,looks like a target combo for sure
MMA,not_removed,no all of this happens in a split second he would have had to have superhuman reflexes to jump on his back and choke him what he actually did was follow him to the fence where he repeatedly punch him until the ref stopped it it was pretty quick tho
MMA,not_removed,the other guy explained it based on this particular fight but in general fighters are trained to keep inflicting damage until the referee stops the fight the refs job is to protect the fighters and the fighters job is to make the ref stop the fight the last thing a guy wants is to train for four months have a guy in a compromising position and lay off on him only to have the tides turn and have the other guy make a comeback and win
MMA,not_removed,yes httpsyoutubecejrbeykrou
MMA,not_removed,awesome work dude keep it up
MMA,not_removed,that sorority one is terrifying
MMA,not_removed,dude followed immediately you are a beast
MMA,not_removed,can you do a baseball super saiyan sometime never seen a good one
MMA,not_removed,even sicker with sound
MMA,not_removed,thanks will check it out dont have an account so i cant like your shit though
MMA,not_removed,i tagged him on instagram do you have one
MMA,not_removed,that edited video with the sorority made it even creepier
MMA,not_removed,true lets do it
MMA,not_removed,good on you
MMA,not_removed,yeah blame whoever furys fight picks is twitter and facebook in general are like that reupping others content for their own gain
MMA,not_removed,they did in the replies they credit rayrod from facebook which matches ops reddit username
MMA,not_removed,where is that from in the gif it looks so familar lol
MMA,not_removed,how long do these super saiyan gifs take you to make theyre awesome
MMA,not_removed,sound effects would be great too the sherlock one also didnt disappoint
MMA,not_removed,i dont think it was the same guy who did this but heres another one of ronda edit just for the hell of it heres httpsimgurcomgalleryevxtdlb
MMA,not_removed,instagram
MMA,not_removed,make one for wonderboy because he is a huge dbz fan maybe his hendricks combo
MMA,not_removed,hahahahaha
MMA,not_removed,wow almost upvotes in an hour i guess you guys have to make a very high quality content exception on this one
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfilpcqpbaiy
MMA,not_removed,that dude was a warrior
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwinstagramcompbjwzvkwbwyk aug at utc here is donald cerrone cowboycerrone going super saiyan after an amazing hit combo during against rick story this combo was all i could think about after the fight so i figured it was worthy of treatment i made a gif version for reddit that has no watermark so if you see it around social media its cool i wanted an all clean watermark version out cowboy donaldcerrone supersaiyan conormcgregor ufc httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,no one gets your joke
MMA,not_removed,thanks for the explanation yeah i figured but it was seamless so i wasnt sure haha very clean and i know youll just get better keep it up
MMA,not_removed,thank you
MMA,not_removed,ah true i imagine that would be quite a lot of effort
MMA,not_removed,it is man congrats by god youve done it
MMA,not_removed,this looks like when you play someone in street fighter or super smash that are just on another level you go into the match confident and then cant even touch them real demoralizing shit
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwinstagramcompbjwzvkwbwyk aug at utc here is donald cerrone cowboycerrone going super saiyan after an amazing hit combo during against rick story this combo was all i could think about after the fight so i figured it was worthy of treatment i made a gif version for reddit that has no watermark so if you see it around social media its cool i wanted an all clean watermark version out cowboy donaldcerrone supersaiyan conormcgregor ufc httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,my friend was in the second row and actually kept one of the zeros
MMA,not_removed,i think brock lesnar said that by mistake once lol
MMA,not_removed,i cant believe that didnt end him
MMA,not_removed,story is an exceptionally rugged dude the only other time hes been finished is when maia started to pull his head the fuck off
MMA,not_removed,i must admit the way he hopped a little and threw his arms up in a seeming manner of are you fucking kidding me im done nope before turning back and timidly facing cerrone makes me giggle like a schoolgirl
MMA,not_removed,fuck blink twice and the dude is already staggering
MMA,not_removed,also not normal speed
MMA,not_removed,literally not normal speed
MMA,not_removed,just fyi if you add gifv to an imgur gif it turns it into not a piece of crap
MMA,not_removed,im actually impressed he had it all mapped out in his head and it worked after seeing the real thing the ops dragonball vidya is more understandable and well done have an orange arrow thing
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,hah that gif is just less slowed down than the one posted earlier
MMA,not_removed,finish up with the
MMA,not_removed,i like that he holds back on his punching when the other guy is wobbling around that is sportsmanship at its finest
MMA,not_removed,they called me kid gorgeous later on it was kid presentable then kid gruesome and finally kid moe
MMA,not_removed,this was the i thought of
MMA,not_removed,man the speed of this always amazes me basically they do what comes naturally to them and train those instincts to ridiculous levels
MMA,not_removed,yeah and thats actually happened before assumed stoppage and the fight ended the other way
MMA,not_removed,not available in my latvia like potato
MMA,not_removed,proud of you
MMA,not_removed,anyone have the original
MMA,not_removed,made this one in round of the recent hq gif tournament edit spelling
MMA,not_removed,sounds like reddit
MMA,not_removed,looks like the score from street fighter ii arcade mode but its pretty generic pixel numbers so could be from a million places very scott pilgrimesque
MMA,not_removed,thanks bro they can take a lot of time hours plus
MMA,not_removed,just minutes give or take
MMA,not_removed,the sage one was sick
MMA,not_removed,hahahah that sage gif is fucking amazing cracks me up
MMA,not_removed,rbettereveryloop
MMA,not_removed,haha instant follow
MMA,not_removed,mods are all offline shhh
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,kenny florian was caught plagiarizing a while back so a running joke here is to give him credit for every quotestory
MMA,not_removed,youre not wrong although i think it might be face not mouth i am totally unsure though dont hold me to that its definitely mike tyson though
MMA,not_removed,ea sports ufc ranked mode in a nutshell
MMA,not_removed,lucky i bet rick storys grieving family would pay big bucks for that
MMA,not_removed,lmaoooo
MMA,not_removed,like his career or his life
MMA,not_removed,it did he was finished very shortly after that he didnt fall over but he was done
MMA,not_removed,that was really weird watching maia juice him ive never seen that before
MMA,not_removed,he thought two other dudes ran in the octagon and started kicking his ass with cowboy
MMA,not_removed,thats exactly what i was thinking id guess the initial combo is practiced and the rest is pure instinct though i dont watch a lot of mma
MMA,not_removed,basically they do what comes naturally to them actually theyre training out what comes natural and replacing it with something artificial that theyve made instinctual
MMA,not_removed,yeah and they avoid getting caught going for the back may allow time for the other guy to recover or worse he may be more coherent than you think and catch you with a shot out of no where fighters are looking to capitalize on the damage they can cause without taking too much risk
MMA,not_removed,hope u can watch it
MMA,not_removed,we have potatoes here if you really want i can send some
MMA,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomrecentdeliriousiggypops
MMA,not_removed,damn now i want a sodie pop
MMA,not_removed,ya the good thing about reddit is that the source will be asked for if it was not provided and fuckery will be called out and that callout upvoted most of the time
MMA,not_removed,hey if i do something spectacular in my upcoming fight can you make me a super saiyan too ive always wanted to become one lol notjoking
MMA,not_removed,ooooo op now you have to make uroxannemodafferi into a super saiyan man with great power comes great responsibility my friend p
MMA,not_removed,but that is ten hours well spent my friend thank you its sooooooo good noforgayjesus nohomo maybealilhomo
MMA,not_removed,great work what software do you use
MMA,not_removed,have you got a news source on that la ufo one looks intriguing
MMA,not_removed,do you animate every frame do you have some kind of clipboard of super saiyan effects this is seriously amazing
MMA,not_removed,jul at utc httpsstreamablecomnswm that moment when the hunter became the hunted ð you cant just catch a mewtwo mewtwo catches you ha original footage by yesimprettyvee ð pokemongo tag a friend ðð½ httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,you gotta play a lot to be good at any video game dont feel to bad about it
MMA,not_removed,well their hospitalization bills are really hurting them right now
MMA,not_removed,both
MMA,not_removed,yes
MMA,not_removed,wasnt sure what you meant when you said juice looked up video maia literally squeezes juice out of story oh
MMA,not_removed,that kick from the reverse angle is brutal anybody else would have had a minced face
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,yeah if they do whats natural theyll get gassed in the first round
MMA,not_removed,wow man thanks
MMA,not_removed,v
MMA,not_removed,forgive my ignorance but what is this from
MMA,not_removed,hey roxanne youre a killer of course i would d
MMA,not_removed,just went through your highlights and stuff and man op has a lot to work with
MMA,not_removed,roxanne youre a badass keep up the good work looking forward to your future super saiyan mastery
MMA,not_removed,op pls
MMA,not_removed,you can be hercule
MMA,not_removed,at first i thought you were some random guy requesting to be ss from some normal action
MMA,not_removed,hahahah thanks man
MMA,not_removed,thanks man adobe after effects mostly
MMA,not_removed,even then you have to contend with cheating
MMA,not_removed,why dont more people die in mma youd expect it to be more common administering all the head hits
MMA,not_removed,lol i love this gif and your username could i also say username checks out in context of the gif
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,iggy pops recent iggy pops
MMA,not_removed,nice
MMA,not_removed,ray rod the super saiyan guy
MMA,not_removed,yay d
MMA,not_removed,op just acts like a known ufc fighter didnt just ask him to make her go super saiyan
MMA,not_removed,cool stuff keep creating
MMA,not_removed,they stop fights with more major injuries cuts or when the fighter is kod its still a young sport too but so far only one former fighter has been diagnosed with dementia pugilistica and it could be argued it was due to him not retiring when he should have
MMA,not_removed,compared to boxing its almost negligible
MMA,not_removed,just waiting for hendo to be diagnosed in a few years
MMA,not_removed,yeah and liddell
MMA,not_removed,and bisbing
MMA,not_removed,i used to do just wing chun and when moving to proper mma fighting i could see the difference in training attitude kung fu guys want to be the best fighter in the world without doing much hard work avoid difficult training situations like sparring and only do drills they have no reference of real fighting which leads to all these techniques that just work in theory some arts are just straight bullshit though and no matter how much you spar the techs are useless
MMA,not_removed,interesting video i think the reason kung fu is waning is because it requires a much higher degree of mastery than other mainstream martial arts to be effective in real fighting its also rather complex btwy a lot of bruce lees acrobatics in films is inspired more from tae kwon do than kung fu
MMA,not_removed,kung fu lives on in sanda but the current crap that randoms pretend to matter should just vanish into obscurity
MMA,not_removed,it still serves an artistic purpose like the wai kru in muay thai which is beautiful but useless
MMA,not_removed,hi your submission was removed from rmma because it broke one of our rules no lowquality content including but not limited to memes jokes daetil style posts questions with simple answers wikipedia vandalism and ridiculous hypothetical fights httpswwwredditcomrmmawikirules if you disagree with this decision or if you think we made a mistake please use this link to
MMA,not_removed,joe rogan swallowed the dip he is going to yak
MMA,not_removed,rogan has swallowed tobacco is smoking weed and drinking beer cerrone is drunk and talking about flat earth space and lizard people this is legendary
MMA,not_removed,bj penn thinks the world is flat wtf man
MMA,not_removed,looking forward to this when cerrone broke the news to joe that ronda isnt that hot he looked so heartbroken last time
MMA,not_removed,joe just swallowed a bunch of dip i give him minutes til he vomits
MMA,not_removed,hes gunna fight lawler calling it now
MMA,not_removed,bahahaha he swallowed the dip
MMA,not_removed,its the mma way any online live streamed content relating to mma must start at least minutes late
MMA,not_removed,never seen joe like this lol
MMA,not_removed,gina clear my schedule for the afternoon
MMA,not_removed,holy shit he just swallowed a whole plug while smoking a j that is not a good combo time stamp pm pst when does he go ralph
MMA,not_removed,rogan going to be sleeping at the studio tonight
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i dont know how cerrone is still alive constantly almost bit by rattle snakes walked in on a mountain lion when a child talking shit to cops pulling guns on him carrying a gun everywhere while constantly getting in fightsconflicts cage fighter scuba diving and pushing to go deeper and chase sharks sky dives rides all sorts of off roading vehicles at full throttle am i missing anything
MMA,not_removed,donald cerroneayyy
MMA,not_removed,if rogan gets cowboy to do dmt and cowboy for some crazy reason decides not to fight anymore i will personally punch joe in the dick he may kill me afterwards but i will do it
MMA,not_removed,cowboy does to rogan what rogan did to schaub keep the wandering of opinions in check
MMA,not_removed,powerful podcast
MMA,not_removed,dude is always late
MMA,not_removed,rogan is lit
MMA,not_removed,youre definitely biascowboy glad to see joe accepts it
MMA,not_removed,dmt is mushrooms times a million plus aliens lmfao
MMA,not_removed,why isnt it on yet isnt it in the west coast ago
MMA,not_removed,and i thought eddie was high during the fight companion
MMA,not_removed,how drunk was rogan
MMA,not_removed,them plotting to kill the dude over treasure is killing me
MMA,not_removed,ooh fuck a cowboy fight is gonna be announce soon hopefully its got joe all excited
MMA,not_removed,yay
MMA,not_removed,joe may not survive this episode how soon until he ducks out to vomit
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck is joe on about
MMA,not_removed,hammerhead tittieslmao
MMA,not_removed,where you at joe kenny florian
MMA,not_removed,lmao id be the asshole trying to take your girlfriend and fight you at the bar cowboy is actually pretty chill
MMA,not_removed,rogans gotta try snus instead of copenhagen no spit and can get super powered shit lol its hilarioius watching him dip though
MMA,not_removed,oh shit
MMA,not_removed,this has lasted much longer than i expected what a treat and im running on hours of sleep
MMA,not_removed,one of the best joes podcasts almost as good as when joe diaz is there
MMA,not_removed,so thats and from now on p can help im from eu so yeah xd
MMA,not_removed,lol joes getting kinda annoying schaublike
MMA,not_removed,ensuring that when people google cerrone rogan podcast they get new results instead of the usual homophobia and admission and glorification of assault
MMA,not_removed,so am i missing something or is it just starting late
MMA,not_removed,cowboy could at least educate joe on how to throw a dip before lmao hes getting loose
MMA,not_removed,in this episode americans have no idea how knights work
MMA,not_removed,rogan doesnt normally drink this much hes plastered and its hilarious i love that he doesnt have to worry about the sjws when cerrone is on his show merica
MMA,not_removed,haha he got in trouble for talking shit about ronda
MMA,not_removed,in the not too distant future i foresee cowboy cerrone being killed in a freak accident during a deep dive
MMA,not_removed,great to hear cerrone is back on jre but does anyone else think rogan needs to get a few more new guests on the show seems to be recycling a bit lately
MMA,not_removed,has it started yet
MMA,not_removed,donald cerrone is a riffraff fan
MMA,not_removed,cowboy eats ass confirmed
MMA,not_removed,so i think cerrone is a giant dbag anyone else cmon where my dawgs at
MMA,not_removed,this is not the best jre
MMA,not_removed,oh you swallowed it atta boy hahah i love you cowboy
MMA,not_removed,i was confused watching that thinking to myself hes not spitting he should probably spit then he goes and eats the fucking lipper lol
MMA,not_removed,video of joe rogan swallowing the dip
MMA,not_removed,he powered through
MMA,not_removed,did he puke
MMA,not_removed,and they go into mma duh hunting dmt history of cannabis stuff they got everything in there
MMA,not_removed,he needs to visit the observatory in his home state
MMA,not_removed,im not surprised
MMA,not_removed,thats up there with faber being antivaccination
MMA,not_removed,id still smash that
MMA,not_removed,the donald cerrone hour brought to you by onnit
MMA,not_removed,i was watching that live it was hilarious except ronda is not hot joe what
MMA,not_removed,please link
MMA,not_removed,yup i cant leave work now because i need to see this happen hahaha
MMA,not_removed,it was a small pinch my buddy yaked from a smaller pinch
MMA,not_removed,sounds like it is that level of a fight
MMA,not_removed,isnt lawler still on suspension cuz hes concussed
MMA,not_removed,gsp is my guess
MMA,not_removed,lawler gsp or conor
MMA,not_removed,cowboy said at the end well see him at that fight would be hype
MMA,not_removed,thats next level high
MMA,not_removed,except the mma hour cause ariel is a consummate professional
MMA,not_removed,hes totally marking out
MMA,not_removed,sir you havent had anything on your schedule in months and my name isnt gina
MMA,not_removed,hes been using drugs his whole life though he probably has an ungodly tolerance to them
MMA,not_removed,the fucking brakes on that horse jesus
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck ive never seen a horse do that
MMA,not_removed,i feel like thats a great way for a horse to break a leg
MMA,not_removed,he used to be a bullfighter if im not mistaken and you left off his heavy alcoholism
MMA,not_removed,is a fan of wheeler walker jr httpsyoutubeiqnlxuolzew
MMA,not_removed,got into an accident that left him split open to the point where his insides were spilling out the scar on his back is where they took out inches of his gut
MMA,not_removed,most of these are fairly safe and he got away with the cops shit because hes white
MMA,not_removed,go get some
MMA,not_removed,its not ahyuaska hes going to trip nuts for minutes and then feel euphoric
MMA,not_removed,powerful advertising
MMA,not_removed,what was that in relation to
MMA,not_removed,all part of the experienceâ¢
MMA,not_removed,he was dipping smoking weed and drinking beer yes
MMA,not_removed,nick diaz
MMA,not_removed,hes hurt
MMA,not_removed,correct
MMA,not_removed,alleged assault p
MMA,not_removed,yeah rogan is always late should start soon
MMA,not_removed,hes been way more sloshed tbh
MMA,not_removed,see shane smith episodes
MMA,not_removed,i think it was for saying fag
MMA,not_removed,started just now
MMA,not_removed,nah cerrone is awesome now prepare for the downvote storm of your life
MMA,not_removed,ill watch the podcast with rogan but im not a big fan of cerrone an athlete sponsored by a beer company is fucked imo and the relaxed smile pose he does during weighins is kind of patronizing
MMA,not_removed,i heard cowboy has force fed a girl his goose a couple times
MMA,not_removed,one of my fav rogan podcast moments ever
MMA,not_removed,nope rogan is a champion
MMA,not_removed,and alligators bears knightfights and analingus
MMA,not_removed,i mean being an antivaxer is ridiculous but i dont know if it can compare to the stupidity of being a person that has travelled the world believing that earth is flat id love to see an episode of embedded where dana takes bj with him on the private jet and lets bj watch the pilot fly straight and they end up at the same place they started from
MMA,not_removed,judging her solely on embedded videos and interviews shed be a bunny boiler but shes decent just not the worldy joe convinced himself she was
MMA,not_removed,she looks more like a female ghostbuster than an mma fighter these days
MMA,not_removed,live link is usually joeroganlive
MMA,not_removed,i was about to leave also now ive gotta wait
MMA,not_removed,so did he vomit
MMA,not_removed,that may not have been dip bud
MMA,not_removed,he was only suspended for days i believe and a months already passed so he should be ok to fight soon
MMA,not_removed,oh shit dude very possible considering gsp is appearing on ufc tonight that would be fucking great
MMA,not_removed,gsp was first in my head but its probably lawler no chance its mac
MMA,not_removed,yea he should stop calling his mom gina
MMA,not_removed,he actually hated weed until he was like
MMA,not_removed,what are you even saying here literally says on the show that hes never done chew before has done drugs his whole life your a clown
MMA,not_removed,definitely not the abs model
MMA,not_removed,i bet that horse has got a piece on it
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,tell that to chris brown
MMA,not_removed,he did say dont buy it at one point as a disclaimer
MMA,not_removed,they were talking biases when it comes to fighting and cerrone said that about rogans commentary and at times cowboy had to mute the fights they agreed everyone has their biases tho
MMA,not_removed,swallowing most of the dip aswell
MMA,not_removed,nah lawler
MMA,not_removed,thats what i was thinking im high as shit and not sure what my logic is though
MMA,not_removed,o shit
MMA,not_removed,hes gonna choke
MMA,not_removed,and he swallows it again
MMA,not_removed,yeah some of those old podcasts in that other studio with all the lights and the props he was so fucked up on some podcasts
MMA,not_removed,can you please link it
MMA,not_removed,gotta punish people for having different opinions obey the circlejerk or die
MMA,not_removed,hes sponsored because he drinks it often i see no issue with that its a genuine endorsement of something he uses
MMA,not_removed,wtf
MMA,not_removed,is that like foie gras
MMA,not_removed,jesus this is all i want now i would pay ppv money for this
MMA,not_removed,even simpler than that you just have to look at the flight patterns planes take when traveling long distances they dont fly directly from point a to b they factor in the curve of the earth and fly in what looks like an arc pattern when laid out on a read flat map unless the airlines are in on the conspiracy and are wasting millions a year flying extra miles out of the way just to deceive the public for reasons
MMA,not_removed,is that a fatal attraction reference
MMA,not_removed,a what
MMA,not_removed,whats a bunny boiler a nut job
MMA,not_removed,accurate i was convinced of this when ronda pulled holly holms arm in to her own face at the weighins to make it seem as if holly was trying to take a cheap shot if you need that to get worked up for a fight there are some issues underneath the surface for sure
MMA,not_removed,i giggle every time he says it
MMA,not_removed,oh i meant the cowboy calling ronda unattractive link
MMA,not_removed,nah stronger stomach than mine i wouldve yakked all over cerrone had i swallowed that stuff
MMA,not_removed,i had sixteen shots but it was the dip that did me in
MMA,not_removed,cool thatll be a barn burner of a fight
MMA,not_removed,cowboy said they were good friends so i dont think its conor im gonna guess robbie
MMA,not_removed,oh no he doubled down
MMA,not_removed,hes said in a previous episode that he started with pot at about age not seriously but did it a little bit iirc he said he didnt start smoking it a lot til about age but thats still combined a good years of that plus hes talked several times about doing a lot of dmt acid and other psychadelics
MMA,not_removed,well i guess its all good then onnit and budweiser are what makes america great
MMA,not_removed,that and cage side isnt the best view so theres whole portions of the fight hes not getting
MMA,not_removed,gsp
MMA,not_removed,that diaz state of mind
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomcpowerfuljrelive
MMA,not_removed,you realize saying shit like this will only get you more downvotes right lol
MMA,not_removed,the issue is if youre drinking often then youre really limiting your physical potential
MMA,not_removed,i know crazy opinion right
MMA,not_removed,yeah i would seriously pay to see that the look on bjs chubby face when he realises the world isnt flat is going to be ridiculous can you imagine danas goof face when he sees the wheels start turning in bjs head could easily be the comain of rondas comeback card
MMA,not_removed,yeah its common phrase now isnt it
MMA,not_removed,httpwwwphrasesorgukmeaningsbunnyboilerhtml
MMA,not_removed,httpwwwphrasesorgukmeaningsbunnyboilerhtml
MMA,not_removed,its all them damn onnit probiotics shiat
MMA,not_removed,and he keeps swallowing
MMA,not_removed,i was shocked to hear that the judges and joe actually dont get the best seats in terms of visuals although joe probably has it a bit easier with the slow mo replay and multiple screens
MMA,not_removed,get yeh dick out of my honey
MMA,not_removed,i am not the same person who made the initial post and i dont make posts for upvotes peoples desire to punishcensor others for not agreeing is very troubling
MMA,not_removed,looks like hes doing alright to me
MMA,not_removed,yeah youre absolutely right i mean cowboy is in terrible shape
MMA,not_removed,could be cant say ive ever heard someone say it before though
MMA,not_removed,he could take the lw and ww belts and still be limiting his potential with beer just throwing some logic into the discussion
MMA,not_removed,yeah its been a common phrase since the film for a scornful ex girlfriend
MMA,not_removed,i understood the reference but ive never heard anyone say it either
MMA,not_removed,maybe its just common in the uk weird the phrase is popular here and not in the us
MMA,not_removed,am from us can confirm not popular
MMA,not_removed,i agree with ubigbonelessjerk heard the movie but not the reference phrased in that exact way i have referenced that before by saying yeah that girl stacy youre seeing she has a real fatal attraction vibe id watch out
MMA,not_removed,am from us and heard it many times the problem is youre all asking guys that havent had any girlfriends let alone scornful ex ones
MMA,not_removed,i could tell you stories about scornful ex girlfriends and ive still never heard it learn something new every day i guess
MMA,not_removed,im over that might help
MMA,not_removed,ariel would be better suited as the criminal they go after something like a serial rapist who targets men and women in their retirement home beds
MMA,not_removed,that editing made me have literally no idea what was going on the way it cut every two seconds was just bizarre
MMA,not_removed,i love a good von flue shoulder to the throat nice simple
MMA,not_removed,ive been training a year now and this is the choke that put me out the guy i was rolling with is extremely good and was able to set it up to the point where i couldnt get my arm out from around his neck that shit comes on super quick luckily he immediately realized i was out
MMA,not_removed,at first i read it as submission of the weak i was still down to watch
MMA,not_removed,that is the best von flue ive seen yet
MMA,not_removed,holy shit this guy is still fighting i remember seeing kid yamamoto knock him out in back in the day crazy
MMA,not_removed,man nobody should get von flued at a professional level
MMA,not_removed,ufc fight pass for prelims and early prelims
MMA,not_removed,early prelims are on fight pass only couldnt tell you about the other stuff as im not from sweden
MMA,not_removed,move to brazil and sign combate full events everytime plus some other events reais about dollars a month and you can watch it online also
MMA,not_removed,if you have a cable package that has then you can normally stream it online at foxsportsgocom not positive if that works in sweden though
MMA,not_removed,is there a free trial or something for fightpass
MMA,not_removed,but how come it doesnt show up in the ufc fight pass schedule it says on the fight card that the early prelims are on fight pass but then u have prelims which im not sure what that even means but yeah so you are basically saying everything is available to stream from fight pass
MMA,not_removed,yeah i figured since it says so on the card but the ufc event isnt on the fight pass schedule on the web page thats why i got confused do you know how to find the prelims or are they exclusive for the cable networks or something p
MMA,not_removed,no hablos espaÃ±ol though i currently pay sek around usd a month just to watch the main events and they are only available hours after the livestream ended and then they are gone
MMA,not_removed,nope no cable we only have the main events on stream
MMA,not_removed,days free trial
MMA,not_removed,nah but i think its worth the monthly subscription its only like dollars a month and has pretty much every fight worth watching
MMA,not_removed,du kan se prelimsene og early prelims pÃ¥ fight pass men ppv mÃ¥ du kjÃ¸pe seperat eller bruke den viaplay pakken fak my english
MMA,not_removed,all prelims are on fight pass i watch them every time an event is on
MMA,not_removed,portuguese
MMA,not_removed,you can switch the language dont know if youre joking but its portuguese
MMA,not_removed,okej tack min norske vÃ¤n i just got confused because ive never bothered to watch prelims before p
MMA,not_removed,even the in that case great
MMA,not_removed,yes they are
MMA,not_removed,something similar happened with michael jordan where nike would pay the fines of him wearing his shoes on the court but i think the different thing here is that the nba players have way more power than ufc fighters due to players association if any fighter did come out wearing some nike stuff i think the ufc either would not let them go out or if they did somehow make the walk then they would probably not be allowed to fight maybe theres something in their contracts that would make it a matter of being sued
MMA,not_removed,i think theyd find themselves without any upcoming fights
MMA,not_removed,lol is this serious lol you all are serious youre out of your mind no fighter would even make it out of the locker room wearing something other than the reebok kit and if they somehow did they would definitely get stopped before they went into the ring and the flight would be cancelled and that fighter would most likely not have a job
MMA,not_removed,yeah but mma fighters who sign the ufc contracts turn themselves into slaves same cannot necessarily be said for the nba
MMA,not_removed,jeremy wont be happy to hear that
MMA,not_removed,hes just been waiting for conor to leave so he could finally say this
MMA,not_removed,he certainly is the hardest hitting when it comes to standing hammerfists
MMA,not_removed,tko finishes in fights sure buddy
MMA,not_removed,artem sawed off lobov
MMA,not_removed,i just want artem to win in spectacular fashion for the implosion here alone
MMA,not_removed,in artem was literally the only male fighter on the roster to have a losing overall professional record you can make an argument that of active professionals he is the worst male on the roster his record now is barley over
MMA,not_removed,the dude who fought chris avila lol no
MMA,not_removed,hahahahahaha hahahahahaha hahahahahaha hahahahahaha
MMA,not_removed,hardest hitter
MMA,not_removed,bless his heart
MMA,not_removed,no one can take dat standing hammerfist shot
MMA,not_removed,didnt he get rocked and knocked down in his last fight when was the last time he did that to another fighter
MMA,not_removed,this poor guy is about to get derailed by cub that hype train isnt even going to make it out of the station
MMA,not_removed,more like by a short shot am i right ill see myself out
MMA,not_removed,hardest hitter in the sport
MMA,not_removed,id say stephens probably has the most power in his hands
MMA,not_removed,the gaslighting heel act should be saved for wwe
MMA,not_removed,wait wait wait the guy who has had zero kos in his whole career
MMA,not_removed,he has conors selfconfidence just not the skills to back it up
MMA,not_removed,god bless
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,hard punchshort punch the story of the russian stubby hammer
MMA,not_removed,artem hits pretty hard not the hardest in the divison but definitely up there just look at his kos on tuf hes the only go to ever do that and he did them with style
MMA,not_removed,seems pretty accurate when was the last time he didnt manage to knockout his opponent
MMA,not_removed,yeah right
MMA,not_removed,damn people are hating but its either him or stephens when he does land flush he hits hard as fuck
MMA,not_removed,who
MMA,not_removed,this isnt even debatable hes clearly the best at it
MMA,not_removed,dynamite fists
MMA,not_removed,its possible he has good or even elite power but with his short arms and relative lack of skills hes unable to land cleanin terms of raw power he could be up there although i doubt it
MMA,not_removed,can we make this his new nickname if he knocks cub out
MMA,not_removed,artem trex lobov
MMA,not_removed,imagine artem facing off against either aldo or holloway and koing them stiff becoming the featherweight champ and goes on a title defense win streak before retiring the champ i think this sub would vanish from the sheer power of such an event
MMA,not_removed,he isnt the worst fighter fighter on the roster but hes at which is a deep weigh class it shouldnt be argued that hes still around because hes conors buddy
MMA,not_removed,youre forgetting about cm punk and mike jackson in your first sentence and hes not the worst fighter on the roster considering he beat ishihara
MMA,not_removed,what hype train
MMA,not_removed,tony ferguson won tuf with only knockouts the whole way up i think
MMA,not_removed,months ago
MMA,not_removed,i guess some people really do need an s
MMA,not_removed,lolno not even close
MMA,not_removed,da
MMA,not_removed,artem vs holloway sounds hilarioushttpstatictvtropesorgpmwikipubimagesjamesarmslengthjpg
MMA,not_removed,or everyone would hop on the hypetrain and say they knew all along he would be champ
MMA,not_removed,i dont even have an imagination powerful enough to imagine that
MMA,not_removed,worst fighter record wise and hence the stipulation of active fighter jackson and brooks arent active they had one off fights for the promotion
MMA,not_removed,doesnt cody have a short reach for his size too
MMA,not_removed,whatever hype train that got him a fight with possibly the number contender
MMA,not_removed,oh youre right i actually just saw that after i posted it maybe artem was the only guy to win with all round kos
MMA,not_removed,da
MMA,not_removed,fook
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,hes one fight worse off than mark hunt lobov is to hunts
MMA,not_removed,cubs the contender now hes lost to holloway lamas aldo frankie winning foty doesnt make you the contender
MMA,not_removed,that would be conors hype train cub beating artem isnt going to derail conors hype train
MMA,not_removed,so silly i laughed bravo my man
MMA,not_removed,is
MMA,not_removed,to be fair hunt has been fighting in the top for a while now artem has been fighting the low guys at
MMA,not_removed,was simply stating hes in the mix he was ranked in the choi fight
MMA,not_removed,lol you are reading way too much into what i said by saying its not going to make it out of the station that means it never really got rolling in the first place we are stating the same thing and you are arguing with me
MMA,not_removed,normal
MMA,not_removed,hunt is also actually one of the hardest hitting in his division
MMA,not_removed,you said cub was going to derail him there is no artem hype train it cant be derailed because it doesnt exist
MMA,not_removed,lol forgive me for exaggerating i guess
MMA,not_removed,this is gonna be a fun year for the minor league mma scene
MMA,not_removed,fun
MMA,not_removed,im really hopeful about this unified league should have a bunch of awesome fights coming up
MMA,not_removed,step be sage northcutt
MMA,not_removed,i can actually imagine him doing all of those things
MMA,not_removed,step dont not be sage northcutt
MMA,not_removed,step profit
MMA,not_removed,watch among other things bisping and jones poke their way to the championship
MMA,not_removed,woodley channeling his inner rumble
MMA,not_removed,video httpoffsidedcomaboutbots httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetowonglik httpoffsidedcomupload
MMA,not_removed,need a phantom camera to catch that right hand that low framerate gif doesnt do it justice
MMA,not_removed,so satisfying called it saw it shoulda bet on it only fight in the main card i got wrong was ellenberger winning but fuck it it was a good night
MMA,not_removed,and i get in trouble if i leave my niece in the car for mins
MMA,not_removed,continuos brain damage in children seems like a great idea
MMA,not_removed,i love the wor watthana kids been following them since the beginning
MMA,not_removed,where these kids come from life is dangerous drug and gang problems are rampant poverty is widespread and the education system is broken muay thai offers these kids a lot of opportunities like free education i havent met a thai who is punch drunk before and a lot of my friends have fights i understand where you are coming from of course but its just a different world here if you have any questions please contact us wwwworwatthanacom
MMA,not_removed,thats all well and fine but just because it is the lesser of two evils doesnt mean i should think it couldnt be better there is no reason for why kids regardless of circumstances should be hitting each other in the head they could still do mt just without the head trauma at least until they are older
MMA,not_removed,to be honest he was giving ronda the right instructions during the fight
MMA,not_removed,glorious
MMA,not_removed,something we never considered maybe its not edmonds fault maybe ronda just doesnt have it ð¤ still a shithead tho
MMA,not_removed,considering the precipitous decline of other good fighters under his tutelage its safe to say hes a negative influence ronda may be one of the biggest wastes of talent in the history of the sport
MMA,not_removed,intriguing fight rivera has looked really good lately
MMA,not_removed,i think rivera will take this fairly easily hes looked fantastic lately and easily nullified the wrestling of urijah whos still a far better grappler than caraway
MMA,not_removed,the winner of this fight can probably wait for the title shot while dillashawlineker fights the winner of cruzgarbrandt cody should have never gotten the titleshot the cringy trasktalk had gotten to peoples heads both lineker and tj have better resumes than garbrandt
MMA,not_removed,mad props to caraway for taking this matchup i can see bryan getting worked for rounds then snatching an rnc for the late win
MMA,not_removed,surprised caraway took this fight i think rivera tkos him
MMA,not_removed,bryan caraway takes this
MMA,not_removed,i think rivera finishes caraway midway through the or beginning of the third dude puts on one hell of a pace is the superior striker and i think his grappling is good enough that caraway will have trouble catching him in a sub
MMA,not_removed,rip bryan caraway
MMA,not_removed,he didnt retire
MMA,not_removed,i hope jimmie takes it i think caraway will tho
MMA,not_removed,i like caraway but jimmie beating faber was no joke and im calling for an upset
MMA,not_removed,became a fan of caraway since the sterling fight but i dont think he wins
MMA,not_removed,caraway getting his fight for out of the way early wonder if him and miesha are planning a summer vacation
MMA,not_removed,oh look princess finally decided to come out
MMA,not_removed,i read it as set to cuddle
MMA,not_removed,collide tittlegoreaf what are they two cars
MMA,not_removed,jimmie rivera did not look good whatsoever against faber both guys were standing there looking at each other barely moving have to change that if hes gonna compete with cruz dillashaw and cody
MMA,not_removed,looks like a fun fight although i dont think this gets caraway any closer to a title fight still fun though
MMA,not_removed,sortaurijah is better in scrambles and in wrestling once its on the mat bryan is a better grappler
MMA,not_removed,really i think rivera wins but highly doubt he finishes him rivera is a decisioning machine and caraway has only been tkod once in his first pro fight by doctor stoppage
MMA,not_removed,better to take on rivera than tj i guess
MMA,not_removed,his sugar mama well is drying up now he had to put on his pants and go to work
MMA,not_removed,try watching the fight again this time with your eyes open
MMA,not_removed,noob
MMA,not_removed,it will add to a winning streak one more and he gets his ts
MMA,not_removed,rivera is ranked so one more win after that almost certainly gives him a title shot hes ranked now of course rankings dont mean much but beating rivera sets him up for a title eliminator if tj beats john linker tj probably gets the next shot then the winner of carawayrivera can fight john lineker whether or not he wins or loses if lineker wins hell still need another win to show hes going to be making weight if he loses hes still a good enough win so that beating him will earn you your title fight
MMA,not_removed,caraway is the jon fitch of the ufc will only give him a shot after he knocks everyone else out of contention
MMA,not_removed,caraway is a tough mofo
MMA,not_removed,munhoz would beat caraway rankings mean nothing
MMA,not_removed,i feel like dodson should be in the mix as well that lineker fight was amazing and theres no reason to treat it like a loss both guys won that night
MMA,not_removed,bispings wife is looking
MMA,not_removed,my heart is going to break if bisping doesnt win
MMA,not_removed,man hard to look at his eyes now wasnt it trt vitor that did that to him
MMA,not_removed,pretty sure bisping knows exactly what hes doing when he comes out with his epic insults and bravado hes hyping hard so he can provide for what appears to be a very lovely family
MMA,not_removed,if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all no wonder why bisping is always so quiet during the weighins
MMA,not_removed,family goals af
MMA,not_removed,bisping has the american family going on
MMA,not_removed,man im really pulling for bisping to win no idea how you could watch this vid and not be a fan of him after this this greatly outweighs and unsportsmanlike thing hes done before
MMA,not_removed,war bispnig
MMA,not_removed,i like how shy callum seems to be
MMA,not_removed,if you dont have anything good to say dont say it at all bisping must be the worlds biggest do as i say not as i do advocate ever
MMA,not_removed,michael bispings head should be the primary case study for steroid abuse
MMA,not_removed,i used to think all british accents sounded sophisticated then i heard bisping talk
MMA,not_removed,must suck to know youll never live up to your awesome dad
MMA,not_removed,ugh i do not like bisping at all but this definitely shows a different side of him than what we usually see glad to see hes dedicated to being a good parent
MMA,not_removed,if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all ahhh haha funny guy
MMA,not_removed,callum bisping is a future champion
MMA,not_removed,how is this not going to be a reality show
MMA,not_removed,everyone forgetting what an absolute douchebag he is because he has a family and a little guitar jingle in the background the way he acted on tuf and his altercation with rockhold last year hes a prick guys put cameras in front of anyone and watch how quickly they become the nice level headed happy go lucky guy jon jones
MMA,not_removed,how much more do i like bisping now answer a lot did have to grin at his life advice to his kids though if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all except if its some bastard youre fighting and then its a free for all
MMA,not_removed,just cant wait for rockhold to put the breaks on this bitchboy
MMA,not_removed,what kind of father is bisping that baby was unbuckled before he even opened the door if he cant even take care of a baby how does he expect to take care of rockhold edit just because this site has a hard time with sarcasm here ya go s
MMA,not_removed,his son loves thai boxing sparring erm then why did that look like almost the first time hed ever thrown punches at a pad and that kick maybe the word love is a little overstating it
MMA,not_removed,steak sauce
MMA,not_removed,sorry about your future heartbreak
MMA,not_removed,i really like rockhold but damn i really hope bisping manages to pull of a win dude deserves it
MMA,not_removed,i already think rockhold is an absolute dick in the media and irl i know bisping seems like one in the media and stuff but he isnt in real life i didnt need more reason to root for the count but now i have one
MMA,not_removed,yes it was he has freely spoken about being disfigured by someone on the juice too
MMA,not_removed,its even worse that the ufc and commission hid covered and ushered him into a title fight despite him failing multiple tests the only reason he got caught was he failed and rogan let it slip on his podcast they where gonna keep it hidden and score their big trtfort title fight then of course he goes before the commission and they simply say ok you can go have youre title fight no punishment or suspension it was a joke even jones said they hid a failed steroid test when he fought him and when dana was asked he was just a deer at headlights and froze before his explanation of j jones said that apparently it can be fixed but he has to leave it semi detached while hes fighting or he could go blind permanently so after multiple surgerys and going blind multiple times before his comeback he gets no compensation and vitor gets nothing but reward
MMA,not_removed,looks like daniel daylewis eye in gangs of new york
MMA,not_removed,can he see out of that eye
MMA,not_removed,is it fixable remember hearing it was fixable but was waiting till he was done fighting i probably just made all that up
MMA,not_removed,one of the reasons hes one of the highest paid fighters edit word
MMA,not_removed,i think he just says to his kids you see what i do at the weigh in dont fucking do that he plays quiet a character on the camera be he really seems like a nice person outside of the media hype
MMA,not_removed,pretty sure he wants his kids to be better human beings than him
MMA,not_removed,bisping has gone all in on the orange county life
MMA,not_removed,couldnt really tell from the episodes but do his kids speak with an american accent
MMA,not_removed,him sitting around bantering with his family erases a cheap shot and spitting in riveras corner
MMA,not_removed,wow you really are a racist adelaide byrd
MMA,not_removed,hes like the polar opposite of his dad in that sense haha
MMA,not_removed,who wasnt shy at
MMA,not_removed,i think youre getting downvoted because people think youre accusing mb of juicing
MMA,not_removed,his accent is no longer british its some kind of hybrid between yank and limey
MMA,not_removed,they can achieve just as much as him hey theyll never be champions so thats living up to it
MMA,not_removed,or maybe its awesome to be brought up with every opportunity in life and never having to worry about money
MMA,not_removed,nah its just that you werent funny
MMA,not_removed,if you have nothing nice to say dont say it at all micheal one eye bisping
MMA,not_removed,i dont get it
MMA,not_removed,if youre not heartbroken at least once a month are you truly an mma fan
MMA,not_removed,how does he deserve it i dont get this and people keep saying you dont deserve to win a title you earn it he didnt even earn this title shot
MMA,not_removed,i dont understand how luke is a dick people claim hes a douchebag all the time and then never provide evidence its starting to feel like ronaldo at least ronaldo flopped a lot so it made sense that people didnt like him im thinking it jealousy
MMA,not_removed,i obviously know exactly what youre talking about but maybe you could tell the other redditors what happened just so everyone knows
MMA,not_removed,i interviewed bisping when the ufc came to my local town and it was one of the first things he said the news outlet i work for was going for a kind of idiots guide angle so stuff like peds didnt really make the final story but looking back through my notes he was so pissed talked about how vitor was like a marvel character during his trt days
MMA,not_removed,the only upside of him losing to rockhold would be that hed probably get a chance ton avenge the loss of his eye against belfort before both retire
MMA,not_removed,such is the saga of bulletproof belfort i cant think of a guy who has skirted punishment for so long or been such a dick about his blatant cheating prime example is when he popped at and got a year long suspension from the nsac told them to fuck right off and fought twice in london before returning to the states and getting licensed by california like it was no big deal
MMA,not_removed,whoopsy daisy
MMA,not_removed,whats even wrong with it
MMA,not_removed,is he really
MMA,not_removed,lol bisping just talked about that in the embedded he said he and his wife promised to not to look like the stereotypical rich orange county suburbanites that they live among yet after they got a puppy his wife started driving around with the puppy in her lap which is something a stereotypical orange county wife would do
MMA,not_removed,haha no joke he shouldve held up an american flag instead of union jack when he won against silva
MMA,not_removed,his year old son has a bizarre hybrid americanish but with a clear northern english sound on some words to be expected i suppose
MMA,not_removed,i agree bisping is a bully and a twat everyone is nice and happy around their family most everyone when cameras are on you and you have a little jingle in the background you could make even hitler seem like a family man
MMA,not_removed,so if you make some mistakes in life thats it you can never be a good person ever again
MMA,not_removed,yes
MMA,not_removed,it was meant as a joke im saying this because you can tell a lot of damage has been done to his head over his career a lot of that damage coming from juicers the joke was not well worded i suppose edit
MMA,not_removed,he and his family live in cali now funny hes english his wife is aussie and his kids are american
MMA,not_removed,you miss of the shots you dont take
MMA,not_removed,no he didnt i train kids and only the total beginners hit like that
MMA,not_removed,that primo shit highgrade the kobe beef of steaks that colombian nasal pow pow flames
MMA,not_removed,ever since dcjones and aldo mcgregor i refuse to get emotionally invested it just isnt worth it
MMA,not_removed,he really hasnt done anything that seriously bad off camera seems like a much nicerdowntoearth guy that rockhold
MMA,not_removed,honestly i would assume they didnt know he was a bit of a cunt to begin with lots of new fans dont really know the stories ufc career of bispings not that thats a bad thing everyone has to start from somewhere he doesnt seem like a bad guy but definitely not someone i could ever root for he has a shitty competitive personality remember the collective mma community basically shrug their shoulders when hendo said he knowingly hit bisping while he was unconscious to shut him up in fact his popularity likely rose from that
MMA,not_removed,not me
MMA,not_removed,nope fuck that guy
MMA,not_removed,he came back from being kod to win a round which won him the fight against one of the greatest fighters of all time in anderson silva in addition to that being his last fight he has consistently showed up and fought for over years he hypes his fights always shows up in shape and brings passion to the sport and for the fans talk about earning a shot whether you hate him or love him whether you think hes a shitty fighter or a great fighter this guy has absolutely earned his shot
MMA,not_removed,just from what i have seen and how he carries himself its only my opinion but i have yet to see an interview where he isnt a douche i know its tv but my wife used to watch millionaire match maker and luke was on it first of all you have to be a little douchey to be on that show and then he was a huge dick he tried to make it seem like they edited it to make him seem like a dick but he acts like that most of the time even chael turns it off in certain situations i dont think luke is acting
MMA,not_removed,i think its mostly this
MMA,not_removed,you dont have to necessarily say something or act overtly like a douche to be considered a douche we have all met someone or seen folks who just by their very nature rub us the wrong way its a fact of life this is the case with rockhold i too get that sense from him i admit it may be irrational but its what i feel like hes just an intensely douchey bro with little going on in between the ears
MMA,not_removed,well back in january of michael bisping went to brazil to fight vitor belfort he ended up and wound up with vitor later bisping later publicly stated that that pretty much sums it up
MMA,not_removed,actually reading that back is weirdly prophetic he said before the leites fight i do think im just one more good win after this fight away from being back in the title picture its getting harder if anything to get back in the hunt for the belt with so many big names at middleweight but if i beat leites then another fighter i am right back in the mix
MMA,not_removed,if he wins the belt that may be belforts only chance of a title shot some kind of grudge match unless they get caught up giving rockhold an instant rematch
MMA,not_removed,look again
MMA,not_removed,httpmmamanifestocomufcfightersalarydatabasesalarymainufccareerfighterearningshtml he wont be obviously when ppv points are taken int account but thats still quite something
MMA,not_removed,if i remember correctly he has the highest amount of career winnings out of all ufc fighters though has fought a lot more in the ufc than most fighters he regularly makes at least a couple hundred thousand per fight
MMA,not_removed,unlikely to happen
MMA,not_removed,union flag not jack
MMA,not_removed,whys that
MMA,not_removed,maybe hes not that bad but the dude has mercilessly talked shit his entire career jorge rivera gives is back and he freaks out knees him on the ground and spits at his corner thats just being an asshole
MMA,not_removed,i would need it to be balanced out smiling when youre around your family is not gonna make up for being a dick your whole career
MMA,not_removed,its like anderson and his kids his oldest speaks portuguese to the camera crew but his youngest speaks perfect unaccented american english
MMA,not_removed,thank you for the obvious statement
MMA,not_removed,actually is the highest grade is the lowest of the a grades
MMA,not_removed,i quit watching for about years when easter island head sat on fedor
MMA,not_removed,i was mentally destroyed after titos losing streak haha
MMA,not_removed,that rivera fight was seriously bad
MMA,not_removed,people forgive this flaming bitch for all the idiotic things he says but god forbid tony ferguson say something idiotic in a drunken stupor surrounded by testeronefueled men this sub just needs something stupid to excuse their hateful views
MMA,not_removed,not to take anything away but he didnt come back so much as silva literally dropped his hands and leaned against the cage for minutes whether you hate him or love him whether you think hes a shitty fighter or a great fighter this guy has absolutely earned his shot nope he has twice had a fight that would get him a shot and twice he lost chael controversy aside the dude is a big draw so the fact that the ufc couldnt justify him getting a shot after years is on him you dont earn it for years of trying your best and being in shape you earn it by stringing together impressive wins if that were the criteria clay guida would have earned a shot by now it pretty ridiculous to be the person in line and claim that he earned this fight
MMA,not_removed,but he acts like that most of the time any evidence to back this up he said they made him play himself up and from everything ive seen hes a calm dude who stumbles on words a lot nothing like the guy in the show i mean any examples because its easy to say that you think he carries himself like a dbag everyone here whos met him says hes reserved and nice
MMA,not_removed,ive seen fighters participate in gamesmanship and this is the evidence that hes a douche jesus christ bisping has said dozens of things worse than anything luke said in that interview
MMA,not_removed,yeah its absolutely irrational i mean i get a sense from your comments that youre a douche see how easy it is to just feel like or have a sense that someoneshouldnt a douche not to mention weve seen like minutes clips of him every two weeks itd be one thing if he did something ridiculously douche but ihe hasnt its weird to see people judge sone one off of their life when we get a tiny glimpse and pretend that that is how they are as a person until i see something concrete im just gonna assume its jealousy
MMA,not_removed,no i realise theres something wrong with it just wondering what exactly detatched retina
MMA,not_removed,thats awesome it makes me happy to know that hes getting paid well
MMA,not_removed,union jack is the nickname of the union flag
MMA,not_removed,i was joking but its because he lives and trains in the us and spends the majority of time here as well
MMA,not_removed,i just wanted to be loved ð­
MMA,not_removed,my whole life has been a lie
MMA,not_removed,never said he was a bad guy but from what ive seen he arguably comes across as more of a douchey individual than bisping
MMA,not_removed,well unfortunately or fortunately the ufc doesnt run its business on this hyperrationalist approach to matchmaking i could easily use your logic and come back with more examples of how other fighters deserved title shots over guys who actually got it be real its a business because of that its subjective inconsistent and unfair at times the bisping argument however well i just dont think its as big a deal as youre making it out to be theres like something fighters in the ufc middleweight division go down that list and imagine having to pick someone who will satisfy the fans expectations fill seats and makes somewhat sense competitively i agree jacare would have been more deserving given the circumstances but obviously he couldnt so who romero is suspended vitor just lost silva just lost whittaker is still not much of a name mousasi needs to string some more together machida just lost etc
MMA,not_removed,lets be real if youre a ufc champion handsome rich theres a pretty good chance youd act a little douchey every once in a while i dont blame him at all
MMA,not_removed,this is pretty douche like
MMA,not_removed,although weidman did come accross way more likeable in that interview
MMA,not_removed,and some people think bisping is a douche too i like luke i just linked the video because the comments on it when it was posted here was mostly about him being a douche sorry if i offended you
MMA,not_removed,googled it you be right my bad i triviad wrong
MMA,not_removed,ok you came back a little with the missing shots part but here you just killed it and ruined your chances of any redemption
MMA,not_removed,same with defcon so many movies increase the number when shit gets real when defcon is actually the lowest state of readiness
MMA,not_removed,i always heard comes from serving the sauce to arthur the probably totally wrong but it sounds nice in my head lol
MMA,not_removed,im not saying bisping isnt the next logical step although i dont think he makes sense competitively im saying the dude did not earn this shot
MMA,not_removed,its not even acting douchey hes confident as a person and people think thats cocky because hes good looking the best middleweight in the world and can get laid anytime he wants i have yet to see an example of his cockiness that isnt like a smirk or something its exactly like said the way he carries himself so nothing he said or does just the way he looks
MMA,not_removed,i agree my biggest problem with this interview is that conor has proven that to make more money you have to be an asshole and a ton of people have followed suit
MMA,not_removed,there were comments about how much of a douche he is on the video of him watching the jones osp fight people just dont like him it doesnt matter the context
MMA,not_removed,he is a douche lol people just have short memories
MMA,not_removed,you good
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i always thought it was like degrees i work in the legal industry so like degree murder is worse than and etc im clearly wrong haha
MMA,not_removed,everybody has forgotten the bisping who spit on people kneed a downed opponent in the face acted like a twat on tuf made homophobic slurs bragged about beating hamill when everybody knew he shouldve lost and even insulted anybody who questioned the terrible decision etc i was a fully certified member of the bisping hater club but he has toned it down the last few years even admitting he was wrong about the hamill fight and i find myself cheering for him sometimes it would be a true rocky story if he won
MMA,not_removed,way to be an asshole
MMA,not_removed,then who would you put in his place
MMA,not_removed,idk i dont really think hes that bad either i think a lot of people just didnt like the pre fight talk vs weidman
MMA,not_removed,why are you desparately trying to defend luke itt its perfectly fine if people dont like him just because youre a fan of him doesnt mean everyone else has to like him
MMA,not_removed,you were not wrong it actually works like that degree murder is worst kind of murders degree murder is best kind of murders same with stakes is the worst kind of stakes is the best kind of stakes
MMA,not_removed,to be fair he never spat on anyone and although people love to claim that the knee on riveria was intentional theres no real reason to say as much riveria was on his way back up when it landed and kind of paused halfway it looked more like bad timing honestly the truth is hating on bisping was just really fashionable for a long time and a lot of the worst accusations dont really stand up to scrutiny
MMA,not_removed,spat on someone who made accusations that his wife had stds fairly reasonable response if not the most mature kneed a downed opponent bad and he was wrong bragged about beating hamill so you think he should say he thought he lost the fight
MMA,not_removed,because you have to have evidence to say shit if someone said jds is better than cain id defend it too
MMA,not_removed,he never spat on anyone people like to repeat that because theyve heard it on here but its not true he spat on the ground in front of riverias corner not exactly classy but nowhere near as bad as spitting on someone
MMA,not_removed,so you think he should say he thought he lost the fight i never once said that i merely listed reasons people used to think he was a douche and a lot of people thought he was a smug dbag for the way he handled that whole fiasco i guess you didnt really have a retort for the multiple homophobic slurs part
MMA,not_removed,ok well ive been into mma for around years now and i am british and used to live in manchester so im naturally going to come to his defence
MMA,not_removed,hmm noone apart from him can know what his intentions were in that situation regardless if another man made claims that your spouse had stds id say it is fair to spit on them
MMA,not_removed,he very clearly did not try and spit on anyone if thats what youre implying
MMA,not_removed,jacksonwink has nothing on mmas most technical strongest smartest fastest and most lethal team in all of combat sports
MMA,not_removed,interesting that they put the pettis bros i know they trained there a bit but theyre known to be under the rufus banner
MMA,not_removed,its scariest under their cage
MMA,not_removed,jason macdonald i forgot about that guy the original ginger
MMA,not_removed,i cant seem to find cowboy where is he
MMA,not_removed,condit jones and cowboy alone could ruin an army of men you add stann and kennedy and they could literally ruin an army
MMA,not_removed,too lazy to check is travis browne there
MMA,not_removed,no big brown
MMA,not_removed,row guy the russian guy i forgot his name he was a killer hes retired now right
MMA,not_removed,why you have jujitsu coaches jacksonwink why
MMA,not_removed,reem is back with jackson and wink
MMA,not_removed,tom duquesnoy o
MMA,not_removed,shaurb isnt there but both pettis bros are lol
MMA,not_removed,i will never understand that circlejerk
MMA,not_removed,not so much this year btw slow your roll hungry
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,yeah but how many of those guys get attention from jackson and winklejohn only the top guys get mentored by them if im being frank
MMA,not_removed,is jackson or wink the mastermind behind the eye pokes
MMA,not_removed,can anyone spot cowboy
MMA,not_removed,ill run up on that gym with a nina and a maskand turn around and run back
MMA,not_removed,bantamweight diego sanchez in the bottom

MMA,not_removed,would translate better if it were names and not faces probably wouldnt be as effective as an ad though
MMA,not_removed,why is rashad on there
MMA,not_removed,anyone know the asian above holm
MMA,not_removed,so is pettis done with roufusport
MMA,not_removed,how many of them have fought eachother in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,why wouldnt they go with past present and future
MMA,not_removed,i wonder why a lot of the pro fighters train there theres only so many coaches brian stann was explaining how he barely got any personal coaching there because there were so many fighters so he left to another gym where he was their main focus
MMA,not_removed,bj penn gsp dont they have other gyms
MMA,not_removed,need to see groovy lando fight again his style is just so damn entertaining to watch
MMA,not_removed,i dont know id fight them i have deadly techniques they cant utilize in the game of mma
MMA,not_removed,frank mirs photo is fucking hilarious
MMA,not_removed,they dont have a winning team
MMA,not_removed,check out their httpwwwjacksonwinkcomathletes they have a ufc fighter from every weightclass crazy stuff
MMA,not_removed,that picture of browne traumatized me so much that im currently hiding under the octagon at jacksonwink mma waiting for jones once he pokes my eyes out i will never have to see that picture again wish me luck
MMA,not_removed,omfg this should be rmmas banner
MMA,not_removed,jesus christ someone tweet this to edmond
MMA,not_removed,holy shit ronda looks huge in that picture edit might just be the angle seriously this time haha
MMA,not_removed,better for advertisement
MMA,not_removed,also penn is in there it seems like they just put anybody who has ever trained at jacksons and is in the ufc on that wall
MMA,not_removed,travis is also on the poster but hes with edmund
MMA,not_removed,gsp too
MMA,not_removed,after the jon jones debacle they installed a trap door underneath the main cage that leads to a tunnel that goes to a secret room the room has a couch bed tv xbox netflix fridge and a multiple bottles of clean urine
MMA,not_removed,do yourself a favour and go back and watch his fight with maia i rewatched it this week in making a maia video and its got really great back and forth grappling exchanges in the first and third round macdonald performed admirably against such a beast on the ground
MMA,not_removed,row between bj penn and anthony pettis
MMA,not_removed,where is cerrone
MMA,not_removed,yup lol two heads to the right of greg jackson
MMA,not_removed,was he on the team for sure
MMA,not_removed,to the right of jackson when looking at the picture behind the guy in the black shirt he didnt have a beard back then edit wrong person
MMA,not_removed,adlan amagov he actually fought a few weeks ago in russia so hes probably unretired
MMA,not_removed,did he leave them for his title fight he was there for his fight against arlovski
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,does that matter they create a system and choose their trainers
MMA,not_removed,jon jones developed the deadly eye poke style while he was master of the white lotus clan and later taught the technique to a select few at jw
MMA,not_removed,wink think about it
MMA,not_removed,next to bj penn
MMA,not_removed,past present and many more to come
MMA,not_removed,httpswwwinstagramcomkaratehottiemmahlen
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,im just cringing at ronda salivating over traviss man meat or lack there of in her sisters thong because there is no way ronda wears thongs only do nothing bitches wear thongs and gstrings ronda and her horsewomen stick to white cotton granny panties and boy shorts
MMA,not_removed,i second this motion
MMA,not_removed,we would need master sensei edmunds permission and he would also require a a month fee for us to use his image you see before he became the worlds greatest combat coachman he was an underwear model in armenia for bolo sport a european knockoff of polo sport
MMA,not_removed,please dont i may or may not live within a mile radius of the mecca that is the glendale fight club and if master sensei edmund is even slightly perturbed by it not only will he throw down but he will get his am mwf kougar kickboxing class to join in on my beat down then he will put on his jc penny suit and take me to court to sue for defamation of character and irreparable damages as the picture made himself and ronda so depressed they locked themselves in a room form two weeks watching all of edmunds mui thai kickboxing boxing mma and male modeling tapes while eating pints on pints on pints of ben and jerrys that travis delivers on cue whenever she or master sensei edmund need to be refueled
MMA,not_removed,thats what i thought but didnt add cody nolove
MMA,not_removed,super master sensei edmund the diamond tarverdyan
MMA,not_removed,it would be weird if they didnt include gsp
MMA,not_removed,ah yes the infamous jacksonwink spider hole
MMA,not_removed,looks nothing like him
MMA,not_removed,hooooly shit thank you wec days
MMA,not_removed,i thought that was josh neer
MMA,not_removed,its tough man but wheres carwin wasnt he a jackson guy too
MMA,not_removed,i think theyre talking about brendan schuab not travis browne lol
MMA,not_removed,yeah that dude is a monster i hope he gets back in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,i thought he wasnt there for the arlovski fight
MMA,not_removed,that would make a good mma movie
MMA,not_removed,lol good one
MMA,not_removed,im just cringing at your comment honestly i think you should settle down
MMA,not_removed,urandomstp pls
MMA,not_removed,bolo youngs ripoff brand if im not mistaken
MMA,not_removed,come on now you and i both know there is only one sensei in mma and thats the current reincarnation of chungdrag dorje otherwise known as steven seagal
MMA,not_removed,he got an anonymous text his dad was in the area on photo day httpiimgurcomoaygcdojpg
MMA,not_removed,maybe it was made a while ago
MMA,not_removed,i thought he was primarily with tristar i know he trained at jackson wink but i was just expanding on op saying the pettis bros are mostly with rufus sport
MMA,not_removed,is that gsp on the bottom left he looksoff
MMA,not_removed,after the ufc shitshow jon took an uberxl all the way to jacksonwink after the uber ride he went straight into the spiderhole and locked the door he played ufc using himself to beat up dc watching all his old fights and eating chimichangas and pop tarts for weeks he would sneak out at night to empty his piss and shit bucket and restock on chimis
MMA,not_removed,the right side is darker but its him
MMA,not_removed,misread that
MMA,not_removed,he was they both trained there they had to organize schedules so they wouldnt conflict
MMA,not_removed,k
MMA,not_removed,he wont do it
MMA,not_removed,i guess bolo sport was a rip off of a rip off master sensei edmund is a classy guy and only reps the best armenian knock offs in fact after ronda lost to holly ed had quite a bit of cash from all those wins she had using his armenian connections he invested in an armenianchinese company that was going to be the first to release knockoff yeezys that were to be called fosheezys the prototypes were perfect and the company was going to start selling them a month before the real yeezys dropped so edmund invested all of his money in fosheezy well of course shit hit the fan and the shoes that were being sold ended up being made out of a fabric that was a mix of corn husks and cardboard the sole was made out of used pencil erasers and actually started melting at any heat above degrees even the laces sucked as they were being made out of twizzlers needless to say master edmund lost all of his money and had to declare bankruptcy where he claimed he had no income whatsoever with his last he bought a pair of real yeezys hoping to flip them but they sent them two left feet instead of a left and right and kanye isnt about giving refunds lets just say edmund hasnt had the greatest life since holly kicked rondas face in
MMA,not_removed,ah i was really hoping for
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,oh im sure its him it just doesnt really look much like him
MMA,not_removed,what does png mean
MMA,not_removed,why would they use that picture
MMA,not_removed,for sure get some glasses bro
MMA,not_removed,im trippin balls or somethin cause i feel like i know one of his most recent fights he left jw
MMA,not_removed,i didnt know this is still a thing on reddit i guess i havent been browsing rtrees lately is it still a lot of year olds posting their dub of that fire indo that the dude just hooked up fat for them
MMA,not_removed,its a type of image simplest explanation is its a jpeg cut out with a mask so a picture of something without a background
MMA,not_removed,i think they flipped a coin to see who would have them in his corner he lost and so didnt train under them but as someone else said he still used the gym this all hearsay mind
MMA,not_removed,on the mma hour wink said they chose to corner arlovski because he had been with them for longer that interview explains everything so no hearsay
MMA,not_removed,this should be civil and productive
MMA,not_removed,cowboys shirt though
MMA,not_removed,my favorite part
MMA,not_removed,love the reebok sign on his head
MMA,not_removed,impressive
MMA,not_removed,just saw this as i was eating
MMA,not_removed,please rearrange turd to correctly reflect even number
MMA,not_removed,get this bellend banned
MMA,not_removed,ubellydownarmbar is the winner httpimgurcomagevom
MMA,not_removed,whats your budget signed merch from a fighter would be an amazing gift maybe mma equipment if they trane ufc if thats too expensive get them some alpha brain use the codeword onnit thata onnit
MMA,not_removed,httpwwwufcstorecomufclawnandgardenufchotdogbrander
MMA,not_removed,i would say best bet is an event poster i like getting those and hanging it up on my wall or maybe a tshirt for support of their favorite fighter
MMA,not_removed,i know the odds of this are slim but i have a weird feeling ill be seeing that hotdog branding iron in my mail box from uemmakate
MMA,not_removed,in the another thread there is a list of places to get fighters gear cowboy has signed posters from i believe
MMA,not_removed,can you do a reaction video when your secret santa opens the gift
MMA,not_removed,oooh good ideas i was hoping to spend
MMA,not_removed,i hope you are not joking because i am actually buying this right now
MMA,not_removed,i can neither confirm nor deny your suspicions ps sweet username
MMA,not_removed,haha id love to but im not sure how to arrange that he hasnt answered my messages on redditgifts but if he does ill be sure to ask
MMA,not_removed,check out the ufc store then signed crap is gunna cost you way more though
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,wrestlings pretty hard when you consider their job is to elaborately fall down several times a week for most of the year
MMA,not_removed,lots of mma fighters respect wrestling hell a lot of the og mma fighters were wrestlers as well like ken shamrock not surprised a guy like mo does either he seems to be able to not take things so seriously
MMA,not_removed,after watching owen heart die and too many japanese dudes to count left paralyzed i gotta agree with mo i cant believe dudes like rvd would just land on their heads and neck for dramatics if you havent seen rvd take an rko
MMA,not_removed,every athlete who has done both mma and pro wrestling says wrestling is much harder and takes a far greater toll on your body
MMA,not_removed,i think wrestling was starting to be staged around the old wrestling matches would go on for hours at times and seeing it was boring af it evolved from catch wrestling to what it is today when you think about it the guys must have been like why are we really fighting when we can just make a match look good with a planned finish and keep the matches short it was around the when people realized that it wasnt a legit contest rather performances but i guess what im getting at is i hope mma doesnt get to that point
MMA,not_removed,people trying hard to turn this into some sort of crossover mmawrestling appreciation sub reddit
MMA,not_removed,let me know when a few pro wrestlers take spinning heel kicks to the temple pro wrestling is a soap opera not a sport not even close
MMA,not_removed,lots of wrestling posts on here lately i dont remember this time last year with so many must be cause mania is this weekend
MMA,not_removed,i think they work close to dates a year iirc
MMA,not_removed,sakuraba josh barnett two great ones
MMA,not_removed,mma wouldnt exist if it wasnt for pro wrestling the ufc absolutely would not the ufc makes money using pro wrestling tactics
MMA,not_removed,then theres guys like chris benoit using the diving headbutt for years and doing things
MMA,not_removed,still fake fighting with storylines aimed at kids enjoyable to watch once in a while though
MMA,not_removed,i dont think anyone is debating that mo is saying wrestlers take more knocks than fighters and it is more physically strenuous on the body
MMA,not_removed,firstly how many mma fighters take spinning heel kicks to the temple its not very much at all its not even a strike thrown that often also while a minute or minute mma fight is significantly more taxingdangerous than minutes or minutes of wrestling performance the latter take big knocks every day and they are probably in perpetual discomfort or even pain they get slammed get their brains scrambled etc at a rate far greater than mma fighters do
MMA,not_removed,how many mma fighters have died compared to pro wrestlers over the years
MMA,not_removed,not surprised a guy like mo does either he seems to be able to not take things so seriously its a stretch to say the ufc wouldnt exist at all without wrestling but youre straight up wrong to say mma wouldnt exist when things like pankration existed in bce times and there has been promoters like ew barton wright mma is the natural conclusion from years of developing fighting styles then merging them together to see what works best in a competition circumstance i kind of see it as inevitable i could be wrong though
MMA,not_removed,pretty sure fighting existed before fake wrestling
MMA,not_removed,true and true but doesnt change the fact that it is incredibly difficult to do well and very very hard on your body
MMA,not_removed,its scripted not fake
MMA,not_removed,and im saying they dont
MMA,not_removed,are you really defending pro wrestling as a sport look im not saying pro wrestlers arent physically fit that much is obvious in sports people compete pro wrestling is about performance it is not a competition or contest it is not a sport the end pro wrestlers dont risk getting head kicked fighters do that is the difference stop pretending this soap opera is even comparable to sports like boxing or mma
MMA,not_removed,i dont think thats a fair comparison because a lot of those wrestlers passed from combining steroids and pain killers which is a strain on your heart and vital organs especially for high level usage and the recreational drugs thrown in mma fighters use peds but tend to lead healthier lifestyles associated with training for a prize fight vs a performance based athletic show
MMA,not_removed,whats your point here
MMA,not_removed,modern mma owes a lot of its history to japanese pro wrestling pancrase was basically a shoot wrestling competition a lot of the early pioneers of the game came through that org both shamrocks bas rutten mo smith nate marquart the list goes on and on
MMA,not_removed,mmas existence is highly based on aliinoki which featured a pro wrestler
MMA,not_removed,wwe helped promote the ufc in its early days i was watching a raw from and shamrock and i think vernon white had like a glorified sparring match but anyways ufc was promoted on air by vince mcmahon himself it was kinda cool hearing that lol
MMA,not_removed,fake wrestling is tougher to do than fighting not to mention the wwe is more mainstream than any mma company will ever be
MMA,not_removed,yeah but so what nobody would care if a fighter came out and said hour shifts down at the lumber yard were harder on the body than mma
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,well theyre portraying a combat sport which makes it fake but the athletes involved and real tough people im not bashing wwe i actually enjoy it but bottom line is its fake
MMA,not_removed,and youre obviously wrong because guys like mo have actually been through both
MMA,not_removed,and youre wrong
MMA,not_removed,just because its a performance art doesnt mean its not physically demanding brock lesnar would down painkillers and hard liquor just to get through his days as a prowrestler
MMA,not_removed,i didnt call it a sport a single time i dont believe it is a sport but it definitely takes more of a toll on your body and brain health than mma does do you think a head kick is the hardest shot or something very odd getting continuously slammed and getting your brain rattled times a week while running on limited sleep due to taking flights and big road trips is far more difficult than mma mma fighters put themselves at serious risk like a year youre a fedora tipping elitist
MMA,not_removed,mma fighters definitely use steroids and pain killers and you have the gall to call yourself iqwrestler
MMA,not_removed,no doubt the mma of today was shaped and pushed along by pro wrestling but i think mma itself would still exist regardless i just dont think the existence of pro wrestling is a deciding factor in mma being a thing or notand thats all im arguing really i believe its more to do with barriers to communication shrinking and technology getting to a point where fighting techniquesideas could be widely spread across the globe and televised you could say the same about any discipline insofar as the pioneers that came from it for example would mma exist if judo never happened and helio gracie never developed bjj id tend to think yes because through shared experience eventually someone would find many of the techniques we use today anyway simply because they are the ones that work best they might all not look the same but their existence is some form or another is inevitable kind of like the concept of multiple discovery and then eventually when the world got to a stage where the information could be exchanged and recorded easily we could add what techniques worked and throw away what didnt leaving us mma pretty much as we know it now no matter what im probably wrong anyways
MMA,not_removed,i agree as lackluster as it was it inspired pancrease i just think people would be mixing martial arts and holding fighting competitions under similar rules to what we have today if that fight never happened like they were doing similarly before that fight
MMA,not_removed,wasnt it vale tudo matches or those gracie challenges i would say gene lebelle vs milo savage was the first mma fight in north america but the ali vs anoki was more mainstream
MMA,not_removed,i know wwf did some sort of boxing tournament back in the day as well im not debating professional wrestlings role in the growth of the sport whatsoever thats undeniable im just putting forward the case that without professional wrestling mma would still exist and be pretty much identical idunno maybe like how mcgregor would still be mcgregor if he didnt yell out dana that time but that catapulted him into everyones attention if that never happened youd imagine he would still be who he is today just maybe a fight behind bad example maybe
MMA,not_removed,oooh

MMA,not_removed,what i mean is when people take a fall from the top rope or slam an aluminum trash can over someones head or whatever those things are really happening and causing real damage they are not faking it theres no way to pretend to jump off the top rope and slam the ground you either do it or you dont you cant fake that hell i saw a picture on reddit just the other day of sheamus with a nasty ass cut on his forehead from getting slammed in the head with a ladder the other day nothing is fake about that its scripted and set up sure but its not fake and yes they do act and flop too like in that video to help sell their injuries to the crowd and make things look worse that doesnt make what they do fake though they really beat the shit out of each other they just exaggerate for the crowd and script whats going to happen beforehand
MMA,not_removed,yeah i know what you mean they obviously arent having a real fight they are doing things that are scripted its just when most people say hurr durr wrestling is fake like the guy i replied to they act like its special effects or some shit and make it sound like the moves themselves are fake basically what im saying is when someone gets choke slammed or jumps off the top rope they are really taking that fall and slamming the ground hard as shit for real when someone gets hit over the head with an aluminum trash can they are actually getting whacked decently hard they arent completely faking those things just exaggerating the effects of them but i do get what you mean that the fight as a whole is fake and most of their reactions are either fake or exaggerated which is why i just prefer to call it scripted and not fake but i do get what you mean
MMA,not_removed,i never said it wasnt physically demanding most pro wrestlers were athletes in high school and college but performing in a scripted show and fighting are two totally different worlds
MMA,not_removed,cute insult but you saying fighters only risk their health or times a year is beyond ludicrous you say that as if mma fighters arent constantly training and traveling were cormier rockhold cain and khabib injured during their fights or was it during training did conor tear up his knee during the mendes fight or during the training camp you just claimed these glorified professional actors known as wrestlers work harder than fighters ððððð
MMA,not_removed,i didnt say that mma fighters dont but i doubt that they are taking massive amounts of winstrol and deca to put on or more extra pounds of muscle while taking large amounts of somas and other heavy opiates and muscle relaxers while drinking almost nightly and possibly throwing in cocaine and other narcotics like the wrestlers of the and did also they are probably getting full nights rest in the same town most evenings and eating clean unlike most wrestlers who died from that era who ate on the road in diners and fast food places and worked days a year crisscrossing the country and multiple time zones
MMA,not_removed,maybe it would be more accurate to say mma would look a lot different if pro wrestling didnt exist pancrase shooto and pride were created by pro wrestlers and the ufc definitely looks to the wwe for inspiration
MMA,not_removed,sakurabas my favorite fighter by the way so i owe a deal to pro wrestling for that
MMA,not_removed,yeah it was called brawl all it was a boxing match with takedowns allowed it was awful tbh tho and shamrock or severn did not partake for obvious reasons lol but i agree i think mma would have taken off regardless but nobody can deny the fact that ufc owes alot to wwe tuf premiered right after rawand i meant literally right after no commercial break just right to it and that was one of the launching points brock coming in and doing insane numbers the way they run their business is alot like wwe
MMA,not_removed,how did he get an ass cut on his forehead
MMA,not_removed,so you and boxingczar two random internet goofs know better than mo who has actually done both
MMA,not_removed,no one is debating that
MMA,not_removed,youre arguing against an imaginary opponent you weirdo
MMA,not_removed,they are constantly training have you ever trained youre acting as though every training session is high impact sparring countless strength and conditioning sessions bjj rolling striking techniquedrilling clinch work etc those things do little to no damage to ones brain or body the only time this really happens is during strikingmma sparring which happens once or twice a week at most places also name one mma fighter that are in different cities in a week like wwe guys i never said they work harder you idiot all i said was that their job and lifestyle is far more taxing on the brain and body if youre so confident in your arguments you should be able to make a case without putting words in peoples mouths football is also more taxing chronic painkiller use is rampant in nfl and pro wrestling which only proves my point further thats not a phenomenon you see in mma anywhere near as muchi wonder why
MMA,not_removed,its comparing apples to oranges both have hard training schedules and physical demands and both have their challenges pro wrestlers may not engage in contests and cater to training more for physical appearance but they take a prolonged pounding on a more consistent basis and dont have the luxury of taking time off like fighters can between fightscamps mma fighters take a beating too no doubt but they only have to perform on a public stage at most times a year whereas pro wrestlers perform live times a year in front of a crowd where many things can go wrong putting either down doesnt better the other and king mo has experience in both so he is in as good a position as any to draw comparisons and express an informed opinion
MMA,not_removed,you cant fight the pw fans on this sub dont even try
MMA,not_removed,you are generalising all wrestlers and recreational drug use mma fighters do somethings much more unhealthy like cutting extreme amounts of weight
MMA,not_removed,yeah i can see the ufc struggle business wise without wwe but the sport not existing at all im not so convinced maybe in a world with no wwe it would mean mma would be even bigger
MMA,not_removed,ahhh i see youre just trying to be a troll this makes more sense now have a nice day
MMA,not_removed,lol you weirdo hahahaha he is a weirdo
MMA,not_removed,im not generalising all wrestlers im speaking from eye witness accounts and interviews with wrestlers from that era who worked along sideknew those who ended up suffering early deaths also comparing weight cutting to heavy drug and narcotic use is false equivalence mma fighters may cut weight times a year but many do not cut extreme amounts and have nutritionists whereas pro wrestlers from the heavy travel and drug use era were left to their own devices and were under constant use of these drugs year round with most of them only interacting with their doctors to gain prescriptions and took doses in amounts more than were prescribed or recommended
MMA,not_removed,no one is butt hurt were just letting you know how stupid you sound
MMA,not_removed,i had a hard time deciding between weirdo and goober
MMA,not_removed,you chose correctly haha
MMA,not_removed,dont ask me why but anthony pettis reminds me of lightning mcqueen
MMA,not_removed,oh my god the name james sexual heelan is probably the best nickname in all of mma hahahaha
MMA,not_removed,im gonna say it paddy looks retarded lol
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,straight out of penneys those jeans
MMA,not_removed,suitable jeans for that big irish ballsack
MMA,not_removed,if you dont respect the man at least respect his loyalty
MMA,not_removed,conors jeans look like they have a poop catch
MMA,not_removed,pretty cool picture from a time when there hadnt been an irish win in the ufc now fighters from that group have combined for conor is responsible for almost half
MMA,not_removed,artem looks like a mad magazine mascot conor looks prepubescent aisling looks adorable pendred looks like hes photoshopped into the picture and paddy looks a bitchallenged
MMA,not_removed,this is dope theyve all come so far and i couldnt be happier for them
MMA,not_removed,james sexual heelan
MMA,not_removed,sexual heelan omg goat name of all time
MMA,not_removed,i love these old school pictures of the legend who would later become the mma greatest of all time plus artem and conor are next to him
MMA,not_removed,lol artem had hair keeping it flowy and usual
MMA,not_removed,fucking pendred is the titleholder
MMA,not_removed,artem looked like a goofy high school kid
MMA,not_removed,when did owen roddy come into the picture not literally
MMA,not_removed,why are they all hawaiian bellow the wrists
MMA,not_removed,weird to see conors transformation from this dude into the superstar fashionista that he is now
MMA,not_removed,conor looks like the son of the irish mob ringleader that is destined to takeover the family
MMA,not_removed,who knew that that guy in the jeans would be where hes at today
MMA,not_removed,is conor wearing the pants from a wingsuit jesus lol
MMA,not_removed,bah gawd those pants conor
MMA,not_removed,sleepy boyz gang
MMA,not_removed,guess thats why conor had to copy dudes for his fashion sense
MMA,not_removed,conor rocking those beauty diaper pants
MMA,not_removed,holy shit look at those pants haha
MMA,not_removed,lol james sexual heelan
MMA,not_removed,funny how all the guys in the front got to the ufc the guys in the back not so much
MMA,not_removed,weird seeing mcgregor in an outfit that costs less than the car i drive
MMA,not_removed,i like flowy artem more than i like shaka artem for sure b
MMA,not_removed,why did he think that hat was in any way a good look
MMA,not_removed,the pants
MMA,not_removed,conors pants
MMA,not_removed,its amazing to think that this rag tag group irish of misfits are all at the top of the game now taking the mma world by storm really inspirational stuff that shows that anything is possible thanks for posting
MMA,not_removed,it throws me off to see cathal pendred with a championship belt like obviously he is a very good fighter but seeing him within the frame of reference of the ufc made him look like an absolute scrub haha some of the worst footwork and striking ive ever seen
MMA,not_removed,artem pre juice lol
MMA,not_removed,some of the nicknames fighters have make no god damn sense i doubt anyone calls that guy sexual
MMA,not_removed,on par with andre touchy fili
MMA,not_removed,my favourite is another dude there at sbg chris the housewives choice fields
MMA,not_removed,i know a dude called luke coffey nickname is warm luke warm coffey thats the best ive heard
MMA,not_removed,that stood out to me as well so good
MMA,not_removed,rick the horror story comes to mind nothing beats beastin tho
MMA,not_removed,isnt paddy hoolohan the name of the coach from dodgeball lmao
MMA,not_removed,paddy just couldnt take a good pic back then huh
MMA,not_removed,now in this picture aisling looks retarded
MMA,not_removed,kavanagh with the sandals
MMA,not_removed,wasnt the guy in red in tuf
MMA,not_removed,house of san bernard there was a dunnes in the crumlin shopping centre
MMA,not_removed,penneys finest
MMA,not_removed,what da fook are thooose
MMA,not_removed,god those look terrible i wonder how we will look back on todays tight fitting jeans
MMA,not_removed,looks like a webbed finger
MMA,not_removed,between this and im pretty sure somewhere along the way there was a a fashion intervention and they made him get a tailor but he just cant help it and sometimes relapses back into horrible fashion choices
MMA,not_removed,i dont get this obsession with loyalty you are at the center of your career not the coaches as their most important goal is to see you become a better fighter if you think that you are able to develop better at another camp then your coach should ultimstely support that plenty of top tier fighters change camps conor doesnt cause either a johns camp is the best for conor b conor is that good that the camp becomes a small factor in comparison to other fighters needs most likely b and a little bit of a
MMA,not_removed,hahaha well they are called drop crotch i think they have fazed out tho
MMA,not_removed,goat noat
MMA,not_removed,do you think he was born bald
MMA,not_removed,careful might get edited
MMA,not_removed,fuck uspez
MMA,not_removed,he was still fighting at that stage maybe he just wasnt there that night he was one of the first guys who worked with kavanagh back when they were training out of a shed in an alley
MMA,not_removed,isnt this around the time he had the serious head injury
MMA,not_removed,its okay nowadays he just copies random canadian models
MMA,not_removed,because he starched a guy in seconds earlier in the night fashion was the last thing on his mind bro
MMA,not_removed,the hat is the part you have a problem with
MMA,not_removed,only mcgregor is at the top
MMA,not_removed,its a play on words sexual healing is a famous oldies song sexual heelan
MMA,not_removed,cody the sister pfister
MMA,not_removed,cody the sister pfister
MMA,not_removed,i thought he was chris the killing fields
MMA,not_removed,for me is dominique nonstop action packed steele
MMA,not_removed,mark henry not frankie edgars trainer was known as sexual chocolate
MMA,not_removed,close the coach is called patches ohoulihan
MMA,not_removed,this picture was only years ago tight fitting jeans were still in style back then lol
MMA,not_removed,they look funny too
MMA,not_removed,it looks like a patch no
MMA,not_removed,its a fur mink coat costs like too also hes mimicking frazier in that pic mcgregor dresses extremely well definitely has a stylist
MMA,not_removed,those arent like this
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,my eyes rolled so far back in my head they hurt after reading this comment when will you people learn he just says shit to get a rise out of people he or anyone else that does a good job of hyping a fight dont mean everything they say
MMA,not_removed,yeah i dont think he actually looks down on people that are poorer than him
MMA,not_removed,in one documentary about him he says that he knows all the stuff he signs gets sold so he likes doing it for people to get them paid
MMA,not_removed,i swear this was dead popular for chinos as well
MMA,not_removed,no
MMA,not_removed,i mean theres a good chance that he was ive seen a lot of bald babies
MMA,not_removed,lol i aint scared
MMA,not_removed,i think thats the joke
MMA,not_removed,oh that makes sense then my mind instantly went to a fighter whos nickname is remember the name i think his name was belal muhammad he fought on ufc prelims
MMA,not_removed,filthy rich walsh and cobra kai karafrance
MMA,not_removed,bruh
MMA,not_removed,he was
MMA,not_removed,poor fella got crushed by tons of irony
MMA,not_removed,if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a wheel kick
MMA,not_removed,they were popular in britain around the time they were tapered near the end i even had a couple pairs like that would never wear them now they look retarded
MMA,not_removed,look at the crotch area
MMA,not_removed,fair enough about the jacket but hes imitating my cpa and new kids on the block in the other two
MMA,not_removed,when will you people learn these are the same guys that eat up pro wrestling garbage
MMA,not_removed,yeah i think they were more popular for chinos and sweats didnt really see them a whole lot with jeans
MMA,not_removed,tamdan the barn cat mccrory
MMA,not_removed,luck of the irish
MMA,not_removed,that made me laugh more than it should have
MMA,not_removed,i am so sorry
MMA,not_removed,look at it
MMA,not_removed,im saying that looking back at skinny jeans in the distant future is not comparable to this because this photo was taken years ago
MMA,not_removed,ah this is generalization for sure i am garbage fan but recognize conor says things solely for a reaction or to hype a fight
MMA,not_removed,they looked fucking shit on in all versions though ha can proudly say i never jumped on that band wagon although i did wear chinos for about years straight
MMA,not_removed,im just glad there arent any pictures of me in them then id have to go and win two ufc belts just to compensate
MMA,not_removed,i think what krill is referencing is the drop crotch style of conors pants which is actually newer than the skinny jeans trend look it up on rstreet wear it looks ridiculous imo
MMA,not_removed,i mean skinny jeans were already starting by then but baggy shit was there for far longer maybe the end of an era and the start of the next overlapped
MMA,not_removed,ive literally never seen anyone wear pants like that
MMA,not_removed,youve seen conor mcgregor wear pants like that
MMA,not_removed,theyre definitely not just saggy theres a whole extra bit of material below his crotch they definitely constitute drop crotch id say
MMA,not_removed,rare footage of struve utilizing his reach
MMA,not_removed,every report i hear about any interaction about stipe is that he is the nicest and most approachable guy really happy for his success and i hope his popularity in cleveland can elevate him to being one of the more popular guys overall if he keeps winning
MMA,not_removed,everytime he goes to talk i expect a thick russian accent and then he sounds like somebody whos worked in a us factory for years
MMA,not_removed,did this dude seriously just kick me in the face from all the way over there i remember my first match against dhalsim too
MMA,not_removed,stipe looks like a yoked woody harrelson
MMA,not_removed,cains had the belt twice already it wouldnt disappoint me in the least for stone cold stipe to match or beat the record for defenses
MMA,not_removed,hes becoming my favorite champion and fast
MMA,not_removed,struves response stefanstruve my man crazy that this is already years ago now time goes so fast and so many things have happened in these years youre a true champ in every aspect couldnt be happier for you hopefully well get to dance again one day now im making my way up again have a great day brother ðð»ðð»
MMA,not_removed,stipe is awesome exciting fighter nice down to earth guy also hes the world champ
MMA,not_removed,i remember this fight stipe gassed hard and i remember thinking another out of shape heavyweight was disappointing i dont think he ever gassed again so glad he improved love this dude
MMA,not_removed,sep at utc how about a little throw back thursday it was right around this moment that i thoughtdid this dude seriously just kick me in the face from all the way over there and yeah he really did kick me in the face from all the way over there i probably learned more from this loss than all my wins combined took me a while to get over this one too but it might be one of the best things that ever happened in my career ive always gotten along with my opponents after fights but i think i root for stefanstruve a little bit more than the rest he is one of the nicest classiest guys youll ever meet hes been through a lot the last few years so its awesome to see him competing again always rooting for you big fella tbt ufc skyscraper strongstyle httpsgithubcommortiiredditinstagrambot
MMA,not_removed,real champion mentality right there top man
MMA,not_removed,that egregious fuckin eyepoke though
MMA,not_removed,someone rewatch the fight because i swear stipe got eye poked and the ref didnt do anything and he ended up getting kod or he slipped on the mat and that lead to the ko
MMA,not_removed,he never complains about the eye poke what a fucking boss man stipe has some legit honor
MMA,not_removed,fucking fine god im on the stipemobile this is seriously an awesome acknowledgment of a loss that most fighters would avoid discussing miocic is exceptional
MMA,not_removed,god damn i love this guy goat ambassador of the sport
MMA,not_removed,what a lovable fuck im a big fan of struve as well and it warms my heart to see him praised by his peers he has been through a lot and i hope his career hits its stride soon
MMA,not_removed,freeze yeah thats me the one getting kicked in the face your probably thinking how did he get there well let me show you rewind
MMA,not_removed,stefans response httpiimgurcomdqxjomnjpg
MMA,not_removed,see if we listened to rogan and measured leg reach we could easily predict these fights
MMA,not_removed,i wanna buy miocic a beer
MMA,not_removed,struve looks like in this pic
MMA,not_removed,how can they be so nice to each other i guess it is because they are real fucking men
MMA,not_removed,ive definitely been
MMA,not_removed,stipe is just such a good dude i was screaming like a little girl when he came back and knocked overeem out such a great moment for him and his hometown
MMA,not_removed,stipe has came a long way
MMA,not_removed,stipes classiness and charm bring a single muscular slavic tear to my eye
MMA,not_removed,record scratches yeah i bet youre wondering how i got in this situation
MMA,not_removed,guys like miocic are what make this sport great
MMA,not_removed,heavyweights are so nice to each other its amazing
MMA,not_removed,did you just kick me from way over there is exactly how i feel as a jits guy whenever i jump into a striking class the stipe
MMA,not_removed,why dont we deserve him
MMA,not_removed,friendliest champ right now
MMA,not_removed,i love how during the embeddeds the heavyweights were so chill with each other and everyone else
MMA,not_removed,a true sportsman
MMA,not_removed,it was right around this moment that i thoughtdid this dude seriously just kick me in the face from all the way over there and yeah he really did kick me in the face from all the way over there classic
MMA,not_removed,holy shit that guy oozes class
MMA,not_removed,i cant believe reebok doesnt have him wear those shorts rather than generic shorts
MMA,not_removed,the pop at the end of ufc when he won was glorious this man made me a fan in a matter of minutes leading up to the fight because of how classy he holds himself
MMA,not_removed,one of the most likable champs ever hope he stays champ for a while
MMA,not_removed,stipe hyping up that easy match
MMA,not_removed,funny how many of his fans on instagram really did think that was him in the pic
MMA,not_removed,he strikes me as a working class hero ill admit the heavyweight division doesnt interest me but he could change that for me
MMA,not_removed,so awesome
MMA,not_removed,holy shit i thought that was dos santos hahahahaa
MMA,not_removed,i cant be the only one that thinks he sounds like chuck liddell right
MMA,not_removed,the camaraderie nearly brings a tear to my eye lets punch each other in the face then grab a brewski
MMA,not_removed,classy motherfucker
MMA,not_removed,i liked the guy not like one of my favorite fighters before he was champ but after they did the embedded videos of him just goofing around and prank calling his newly wed wife i was sold hes just a genuine nice guy and i love it over all the tough guy acts we already know youre tough you dont need to convince anyone
MMA,not_removed,well downvotes are coming for sure but these types of posts could be private right when they are made public i am immediately skeptical not that they may not mean what they say but the reason its public and not sent right to the person
MMA,not_removed,steepaayy
MMA,not_removed,stipe is the kind of champ i love humble funny easy going and a all round good guy long may he rein
MMA,not_removed,the ufc poster for this fight is prominently displayed at strongstyle its one of the first things you see when you walk in the doors i always wondered why now i know
MMA,not_removed,crazy to me how i got bashed on here for saying stipe was going to eventually win the belt many moons ago comments about him being second rate etc glad he made it the man is a beast
MMA,not_removed,why didnt struve play basketball hes tall and a good athlete not a tall lanky guy thats frail i think he ha a very good chance of making the nba if he worked on his basketball skills like he did with mma and he would certainly make more money even as a bench player in the nba
MMA,not_removed,hes the champ we need not the one we deserve
MMA,not_removed,footage eh eh ill see myself out
MMA,not_removed,there is no fighter i am more disappointed in than steven struve guy shouldve been an all time great
MMA,not_removed,savage
MMA,not_removed,i was thinking about struve last night and why i dont like him so much it was his loss to travis browne that did it
MMA,not_removed,rare footage of struve reaching his full potential im officially on the stipe train
MMA,not_removed,lol its so true though sad but true
MMA,not_removed,he talks like such a down to earth guy every time he speaks i feel like hes just your average run of the mill hard worker whos willing to do whatever it takes
MMA,not_removed,he and jds are both really cool its funny how the hw is the category where we see the least bullshit between the top fighters
MMA,not_removed,in one of the embedded videos before his fight in cleveland i really liked when he was judging some car show and a little girl wanted him to autograph her gi but was kinda shy he made an effort to be really friendly and make her feel ok saw a picture of jose fernandez doing something similar the other day for whatever reason ive always had a soft spot for celebrities or athletes who are nice to kids
MMA,not_removed,someone tell me why i wanna get hammered drunk with stipe and shoot the shit with him love that dude
MMA,not_removed,met him at a fan expo two years ago he was awesome super happy to be noticed by someone while he was charging his phone and happy to talk about his firefightingparamedic job
MMA,not_removed,every report i hear about any interaction about stipe is that he is the nicest and most approachable guy can confirm met him in adelaide when he fought mark hunt really nice guy as was his coach
MMA,not_removed,i have a female drinking buddy over here in amsterdam from cleveland also croation just before his last fight i was like hey do you know the ufc heavyweight champion is croation she doesnt follow mma stipe miocic yeah of course i know his family he was still a kid when i left for europe me oh
MMA,not_removed,i hope a tsunami hits cleveland and hes the sole survivor
MMA,not_removed,his working class persona is actually what draws me to him
MMA,not_removed,coal mines when he decided to no longer be a merman
MMA,not_removed,teddy from bobs burgers
MMA,not_removed,httpiimgurcomhwfyvlujpg
MMA,not_removed,does yoked mean stoned
MMA,not_removed,can he get a hell yeah
MMA,not_removed,i wonder who stipe will get next i assume it would be either jds or cain seeing how the two other top contenders lost to stipe cain obviously has his amazing victory over travis back at and we havent seen much of jds recently but his fight versus ben was almost flawless and he beat stipe awhile ago either way if cain or jds were to win the title it would setup for a perfect rematch versus werdum or cainjds depending on who wins and if werdum manages to get a win meanwhile
MMA,not_removed,class act from both guys i hope struve starts kicking ass and taking names there was always the joe rogan comments about him barely starting to fill in for his height so if hes put on mass i hope it works out well
MMA,not_removed,reminds me of forrest talking about silva and he just looked at me like did you really just try to punch me
MMA,not_removed,hes the world champ
MMA,not_removed,hahaha it gets me everytime cant not read im world champ in his fight celebration voice
MMA,not_removed,or he slipped on the mat and that lead to the ko you mean the metro pcs sign had previous before tony ferguson
MMA,not_removed,he definitely got eye poked and while i guess you could make the case that he was a bit wobbled and his leg buckled momentarily it really seems to me like he slipped
MMA,not_removed,thats luke rockhold imo
MMA,not_removed,what happened
MMA,not_removed,you forgot the record scratch
MMA,not_removed,stefanstruve my man crazy that this is already years ago now time goes so fast and so many things have happened in these years youre a true champ in every aspect couldnt be happier for you hopefully well get to dance again one day now im making my way up again have a great day brother ðð»ðð»
MMA,not_removed,also why they dont make much money
MMA,not_removed,i think youd have to put johnson in the running never heard a bad thing about the guy
MMA,not_removed,hes not even a true footer
MMA,not_removed,but footage sounds like a unit of measurement for leg reach come back dude its k
MMA,not_removed,no no stay we need more jokes
MMA,not_removed,footage i just scratch it
MMA,not_removed,not everyone is jon jones body type alone does not equate to greatness
MMA,not_removed,why being big and young does not equate to being a successful fighter hes really not the best athlete out there people give him shit for not utilizing his reach but how is he supposed to move his feet like the smaller guys footwork is as important as the physical metrics if not more so maybe he hasnt developed perfectly but i think expecting him to be a champion simply because hes big is irrational
MMA,not_removed,i think his size is a huge disadvantage for him he isnt very athletic fast or strong he is my favorite fighter and has heart for days and a sick back game
MMA,not_removed,theres still time
MMA,not_removed,run of the mill guy talks like he runs a mill and after getting the belt probably runs about a mil
MMA,not_removed,its not though
MMA,not_removed,croatian parents man p same as cro cop never talks shit
MMA,not_removed,a down to earth guy edit its a joke because hes tall im not funny or talented
MMA,not_removed,and this is why he wont be marketed as hard as past heavyweights or most of the other champions even reem would have been marketed harder if he had won having a normal down to earth personality doesnt sell ticketsppvs or get people hyped people dont want a nice down to earth heavyweight champion not in mma or in boxing they want controversy they want a monster hes ride or die for cleveland but thats about as exciting as his personality gets compared to a conor or a diaz or a jon jones or a ronda
MMA,not_removed,definitely has to do with being a firefighter aka civil servant dude already dedicated his life to his people before he ever became a ufc world champion now he probably just loves being super popular
MMA,not_removed,which mall tower city
MMA,not_removed,because they are all aware everyone can punch ko anyone in that division
MMA,not_removed,thats one of the reasons i still like ronda yeah she has her faults both in fighting and the way she presents herself but she always seems to be really good with kids
MMA,not_removed,this stat alone is why i scoff at talks of best ufc hw ever none have ever held the belt for a considerable number of fights given that they folded pride in fedor is the best ufc hw ever
MMA,not_removed,our lake is very calm and temperate also the river doesnt catch on fire anymore
MMA,not_removed,not a persona hes a actually a fulltime firefighter i think
MMA,not_removed,but why ufc fighters
MMA,not_removed,yoked means jacked lots of muscle
MMA,not_removed,can i get a oh oh oh
MMA,not_removed,cain because its new matchup
MMA,not_removed,you slow stupid white boy
MMA,not_removed,hes the world champ
MMA,not_removed,sometimes when something good happens to me ill shout clevelaaand we did it cleveland i am not from cleveland
MMA,not_removed,to be fair theres a lot of middle ground between totally earnest factual statement and just fucking around
MMA,not_removed,guarantee georges used more hgh than stipe
MMA,not_removed,he didnt grease or miss weight or refused usada after calling for more testing so theres that
MMA,not_removed,out of all the people you think its luke rockhold
MMA,not_removed,besides losing a bunch of fights he also has a heart condition that requires career ending surgery to fix but hes receiving treatment that allows him to continue fighting
MMA,not_removed,i cant really tell heres him vs overeem overeem is listed at in that pic struve is easily inches talller than him so he can be or at least or and even if overeems height is exaggerated hes wearing shoes in that pic giving him about increase yet hes still way smaller than struve and lastly most nba players who are listed at arent either dwight howard is probably at best and hes listed as
MMA,not_removed,the rare triple entendre
MMA,not_removed,yeah but everyone knows jones is only good because he did coke and probably did steroids edit im starting to question how many people know this was sarcasm
MMA,not_removed,also long arms take longer to extend and draw back part of the reason smaller fighters are quicker is because they have smaller bodies that move shorter distances
MMA,not_removed,i suggest you watch some semmy schilt
MMA,not_removed,hes a textbook example of why you gotta coach a guy based on his personality and preferences vs his body type he has never looked comfortable as the long outfighter that everyone wants him to be he likes getting in guys faces and exchanging in close and he fights much better that way
MMA,not_removed,remember when everyone including doctors wanted him to retire
MMA,not_removed,the guys been on the receiving end of some pretty brutal knockouts along with his other health issues
MMA,not_removed,is this that there lil wayne song
MMA,not_removed,because in eastern europe if you talk shit someone will kill you
MMA,not_removed,croatian parents and is from cleveland a blue collar town edit lol wrote color thanks chicagojoewalcott
MMA,not_removed,are his parents immigrants if so that would totally make sense most generation immigrants to the us despite what trump would have us believe are hardworking and respectful people my grandparents on my mothers side immigrated from ireland and they were tough as nails and sometimes hard on their kids but they definitely did not mess around when it came to things like morals and treating others with respect
MMA,not_removed,stop belittling yourself
MMA,not_removed,they tried to market cain pretty hard and he has the personality of a grazing cow
MMA,not_removed,well fuck that whole jazz
MMA,not_removed,yeah thats rubbish contrary to what you imply there is no magic formula that somehow makes fighters attractive to fans being a controversial asshole or loudmouth is one way to get there but history shows that its definitely not the only route fedor for example wasnt popular because he was an asshole to the contrary he was always softspoken and respectful of his opponents he was popular because he was the most dominant hw in the history of mma and he did it while being a lhw by rights i dont know how old you are but if you were watching mma back in the day when fedor was in his prime he was quite simply one of the most ridiculously entertaining fighters to watch because he kept demolishing guys who on paper should have won not because he was acting like a roidedout psychopath as in the case of pride era wanderlei silva
MMA,not_removed,i disagree he knocks people the fuck out he comes out with the intention of finishing fights that in itself is marketable hes credited with ending the cleveland curse singlehandedly that put him in the sports history books lots of people relate to down to earth superstars thats one of the primary reasons ron jeremy is so successful im not even a fan of his this is just what ive noticed having watched his last two fights need to look up his match with struve when i get home from work
MMA,not_removed,that and also dudes that big just generally tend to be pretty chill unless they were beaten as kids by their fathers theyve never really had to put up with any kind of physical threat theyre used to being the most powerful guy in the room and accordingly they can afford to be more relaxed than us regularsized dudes i have a much younger halfbrother who is a very athletic hes career military at about or lbs and i notice it with him even though hes very always very deferential to me as his older brother by years hes just not a guy whos ever been fucked with by anyone due to his size and athleticism and it shows in how he carries himself and relates to the world
MMA,not_removed,and that they can kill of humans in one on one unarmed combat
MMA,not_removed,cant anybody one punch anyone in the world if they hit the button unless theyre a childhindered
MMA,not_removed,fedor is the best hw in mma history and it isnt even close and one suspects it really wont be close for quite a long time certainly not until mma can offer lucrative opportunities for athletes of that size that match or surpass the ones they can get in other less punishing sports
MMA,not_removed,logical gymastics
MMA,not_removed,ahhthat makes sense along with the fact that stoned woody harrelson iswoody harrelson i could never put my finger on who he reminded me of but it absolutely is woody harrelson good call
MMA,not_removed,i always thought it was spelled yolked like that guy eats a lot of eggs hes yolked
MMA,not_removed,io
MMA,not_removed,butthole sorry scotch
MMA,not_removed,what a stupid stupid thing to do
MMA,not_removed,and then he punched me in the face repeatedly
MMA,not_removed,oweytch
MMA,not_removed,cleveland we got a champion croatia we got a champion
MMA,not_removed,how about earnestly fucking around
MMA,not_removed,refuse usada what are you on about gsp dipped a while before usada became a thing and recently entered himself into the testing pool for a possible return i know little of the greasing issue so i wont comment we all love nick diaz so im not trying to shit on him here but dont act like hes the most reliable source when talking about people that beat him afaik there is no other source that says gsp was over also remember this is the fight that nick claimed someone from gsps camp drugged him right frankly hes full of shit
MMA,not_removed,you cant be serious
MMA,not_removed,even struve said hes only like and half howard is more like
MMA,not_removed,common misconception its the duis that fuel him
MMA,not_removed,and blondes dont forget blondes
MMA,not_removed,and uses eye poke all the time
MMA,not_removed,anderson silva was pretty fucking quick
MMA,not_removed,schilt got smashed by every legit mma opponent he ever faced he had the exact same problems struve has he wasnt athletic enough to punish people for just diving into clinch distance with him in kickboxing they break you up every encounter like that you have dozens of scenarios every fight where you are forcefully reset into your most advantageous position everyone who wasnt a total can just grapple fucked and dirty boxed the shit out of him in modern mma rules
MMA,not_removed,semmy was bigger and stronger at like pounds and was a better athlete as well on top of being more skilled in the striking and still he was only an average hw
MMA,not_removed,å°æ¹¾çæ¯ä¸­å½ç
MMA,not_removed,i dont know if people think you are bragging or generalizing but many cultures are like that in some countries they teach you how to tell someone to to go fuck themselves and it will be funny but in some others they will refuse to teach someone how to curse someone out for that exact reason
MMA,not_removed,youve never been have you
MMA,not_removed,in my experience cleveland is more a greyishbrown
MMA,not_removed,common man let me enjoy one thread without having someones political opinion or other political shit being shoved down my throat
MMA,not_removed,what trump would have us believe isnt his platform only antiillegal immigration different thing entirely actually makes life harder for legal immigrants honestly enhances negative associations source irishman living abroad for four years spent some time in california during but not recently
MMA,not_removed,yeah hes really giving himself the short end of the stick
MMA,not_removed,fedor at least in my opinion was popular not only because of his dominance but because of his demeanor he was very cold and merciless with his opponents and it gave him an air of invincibility so while i agree that performance is the largest factor persona historically is as well when it comes to champions in combat sports
MMA,not_removed,yeah but ron jeremy will never be the goat since he only grapples with the ladies
MMA,not_removed,slight tangent but mark hunt was horribly beaten as a child and contrary to his shitty facebook spelling copypasta is an extremely chill guy
MMA,not_removed,hey joe
MMA,not_removed,yes but the chances increase dramatically with size the sheer amount of destruction that most heavyweights can dish out with one punch is terrifying
MMA,not_removed,the difference is a heavyweight can virtually hit you anywhere and youre out instead of just the button
MMA,not_removed,i think money is the bigger issue i feel like football is more punishing but obviously you cant beat the cash difference
MMA,not_removed,for real unless someone goes on a year tear starting right now fedor isnt getting dethroned soon
MMA,not_removed,yeah no question fedor is by far the best of alltime in hw the man dominated for such a long time until he got he beat a bunch of greats and never lost he beat noguiera twice and he might be or best hw of all time he beat coleman twice crocop hunt plus a bunch of other solid fighters without loosing except early in his career
MMA,not_removed,it really depends on what youre gauging greatness by fedor was by far the most skilled hw we ever saw his game was still aeons ahead of where hw mma is now years later if you go by accomplishments fedors claim is pretty weak sure he won for years and years but he only fought a handful of legit contenders in nog crocop arlovski and sylvia if a hw champ can get wins over top contenders he has a better resume than fedor this is why i never understood the romanticism for pride their matchmaking was pretty shit as far as competitiveness goes guys like fedor and wand would only fight the top contender once a year and the rest of the year beat up pro wrestlers oversized lb cans or big names barely in the top wand only fought a handful of legit contenders in his year title reign hendo sakuraba rampage and arona you would get that in a single year from jones when he was champ
MMA,not_removed,in can crusher tards
MMA,not_removed,back in my day yoked referred to someone with big traps aka it looks like they are carrying a yoke around aka someone who trains things other than their beach muscles
MMA,not_removed,i think either one works
MMA,not_removed,oh
MMA,not_removed,must have listened to that interview a hundred times and every time i hear it i am almost in tears hilarious i felt like some kid trying to wrestle with his dad is one of the best quotes ever
MMA,not_removed,thats exactly the sort of dangerous grey area im talking about
MMA,not_removed,look up condit vs gsp usada its not what nick says theres a video of the athletic comission guy saying that to nick
MMA,not_removed,all those things are true he did grease there is video evidence they changed the weight limit for his weigh in canada theres a video of an athletic comission guy saying this to nick diaz he called for more testing against condit condit was like usada and gsp went silent it all happened look it up if you want
MMA,not_removed,can confirm i run over an old lady the day before each of my fights and now i have a undefeated record
MMA,not_removed,its true several studies have shown that duing is very stress relieving if i was real rich id buy an island and pave a bunch of roads i could drive around on drinking smoking and listening to music and id be the quiet envy of the world
MMA,not_removed,ah yes the bilzerian method
MMA,not_removed,when it comes to just about anything regarding mma analysis anderson silva is the exception not the rule
MMA,not_removed,silva is special
MMA,not_removed,where did he say tall people cant be fast
MMA,not_removed,you can say that again
MMA,not_removed,and you have thats a pretty accurate description for as long as at least my grandfather has been around
MMA,not_removed,funny in chicago the irish are notorious for overstaying their visas
MMA,not_removed,how does it enhance negative associations when most illegals are hardworking and respectful just like the dude above said
MMA,not_removed,often peoples words are understood to mean different things to different people which is why trumps language is so irresponsible can anyone point to any explicitly racist comments he has made probably not but do people think he is racist many do during the debate the topic was race and he began by talking about law and order then saying black americans live in hell is that overtly racist probably not is it nuanced racism maybe is it easily spun to sound racist yes
MMA,not_removed,barely
MMA,not_removed,i had to unfollow him on fb i couldnt take it
MMA,not_removed,true but mark hunt comes from a place where all the men are huge where he himself was just regularsized thus negating any of the factors i mentioned above hunt wasnt beaten in spite of his size but rather his size wasnt even an issue at all polynesian men being large in general
MMA,not_removed,damn you exposed joe rogan and he deleted his account
MMA,not_removed,indeed id rather let aldo than brock take a free swing at me id die nonetheless
MMA,not_removed,id rather play nfl than have jds teeing off on me
MMA,not_removed,in football the juice is worth the squeeze braugh
MMA,not_removed,so if miocic beat cainwerdumjdsand then one other solid guy by the end of you wouldnt rank him as the goat hw
MMA,not_removed,hw is the last division to evolve to the new style of mma still have champs who have day jobs one dimensional fighters win belts its like the mma time machine
MMA,not_removed,early didnt he lose recently last several years to hendo bigfoot and werdum all were expected to lose and all beat him decisively sub ko and sub
MMA,not_removed,ehhh i dont think people who think fedor isnt the goat call him a can crusher the main arguments against him is that he fought for pride which was basically run by the yakuza so legitimacy is in question also the rampant steroid abuse in pride i am sorry but if you fight for pride and going against a dude who looks like kevin randalman and you dont take steroids you are either an idiot or insane i dont think fedor is either
MMA,not_removed,interesting
MMA,not_removed,the sort of dangerous gay area im talking about ftfy
MMA,not_removed,all of those are halftruths that youve chosen to make definitive opinions about while really having no idea all of those could be true and while i will always admit im a total mark for gsp id never twist the facts to suit what i want to think which is what youre doing gsps corner applied vaseline to him in the penn fight which they were allowed to do at the time and applied too much either intentionally or unintentionally why anyone thinks that gsp would do that intentionally for this singular fight in his whole career is beyond me but still its possible theres a video of the commission guy stating they would ignore the decimal point for both of them for the weigh in gsp ended up weighing in at and they said that was fine why you think that reflects badly on gsp is beyond me if theyd given him the additional hour to cut the remaining and he couldnt then he would have missed weight not what happened though gsp wanted to use vada because he didnt trust the standard testing going on not sure why wanting vada is a bad thing
MMA,not_removed,where do you find all these old ladies asking for a friend
MMA,not_removed,this is what they mean by making sacrifices
MMA,not_removed,buckle up buckaroos
MMA,not_removed,oops wrong thread
MMA,not_removed,is normal
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure roids make everyone special
MMA,not_removed,å°æ¹¾çæ¯æä»¬ä¸­åäººæ°å±åå½ç
MMA,not_removed,yes i have and no it isnt
MMA,not_removed,really those posts are in the minority its mostly just pictures of his family and selfies
MMA,not_removed,aaaaaand its allll overrrrrrrrr
MMA,not_removed,wait what
MMA,not_removed,no
MMA,not_removed,i was referring until he got beat in his old age he only lost an early fight we dont judge athtletes by their past the prime years we judge them by what they accomplished in their peaks if fedor still fought today and lost straight fight it doesnt change that he dominated for about years and was the greatest of alltime during that period
MMA,not_removed,actually that would be ko ko sub henderson a natural dropped the hbomb on fedor and he was ktfo werdum was the beginning of the end but henderson was just the end
MMA,not_removed,do a quick google search with site set to redditcomrmma hell even within the last year ive seen that argument upvoted and mentioned more than a few times
MMA,not_removed,well lets be honest i agree fedor is definitely the best hw of all time so far and he definitely smashed the best of the best but he also definitely crushed some cans
MMA,not_removed,hello i heard there was a dangerously gay area around here am i in the right place
MMA,not_removed,gsp wanted to do the testing he knew how to beat already somehow he didnt trust a usada but trusted the company he was already paying for
MMA,not_removed,bingo halls and kmarts
MMA,not_removed,normal quick normal anderson
MMA,not_removed,and a couple of middleweights
MMA,not_removed,im happy this sub is coming around used to be hate on fedor only fought cans lesnar would have killed him japan steriods never fought in ufc can ran from legits
MMA,not_removed,hi welcome to orlando
MMA,not_removed,well that depends let me ask you something are you interested in earnestly fucking around
MMA,not_removed,i dont think you know what youre talking about at the time he was opting for voluntary world class testing does that make him clean no but then unlike you im not making definitive statements on things i cant possibly know for sure like usada vadas testing laboratories are accredited by the world antidoping agency and it uses internationally recognized collection agencies unlike usada vada utilizes carbon isotope ratio cir testing on every urine sample it collects
MMA,not_removed,everyone loves a good blue light special
MMA,not_removed,normal boner problems is normal
MMA,not_removed,at the same time
MMA,not_removed,everyone was doing roids until very recentyand even now its still a high rate im guessing the japansteroids argument happened before all these top ufc fighters started getting busted fedor beat nogeria twice and beat cro cop nogeria was already past his prime by the time he hit ufc he was much slower than in the videos of his pride days and yet he won the interim hw championship he beat werdum when werdum was physically in his prime this is the man that was just champion recently a couple years ago i think on spike they showed many of the big fights from pride i got to watch many of those fights and i was very impressed by the hw division in pride it was certainly better than the ufc hw is or has ever been
MMA,not_removed,right it should be no biggie changing to usada testing then condit also wanted testing so good on him for calling gsp out for his bs lets face it he was juiced to the gills his whole career yet somehow hes given a pass when we already know other shady shit like greasing
MMA,not_removed,but seriously though croatia is a pretty nice place man cool music festival good beaches
MMA,not_removed,youre right ufc never had the best hw roster first it was pride then it was sf and only after ufc bought out both ufc became the top place for hws
MMA,not_removed,user reports can you please remove the fucking cursor and make the downupvote buttons normal no edit the photoshop contest thread can be found well sticky it again when the events are finished
MMA,not_removed,robbie lawlers early fights are some of the most fun fights to watch just watched him vs chris lytle and
MMA,not_removed,whats your favorite piece of mma folklore i like this story that week before his fight with tony fryklund anderson silva watches ong bak and comes to the gym wanting to practice a reverse elbow uppercut his trainers tell him to stop being stupid and to focus on the game plan he goes home and practices the move on a pillow that he gets hs wife to hold knocks fryklund out with it in the first round
MMA,not_removed,cody garbrant is definitely popular with the gays ever since my bf started following noloves instragram we are always out of tissues for some reason bf doesnt even watch mma

MMA,not_removed,wait hang on i get the joke rmma mods challenged themselves to temporarily come up with a forum that is shittier aesthetically than sherdogs website am i close
MMA,not_removed,further proof tecia torres and rocky pennington are cutest mma couple httpswwwinstagramcompbsovlkxhvle
MMA,not_removed,heres a theory that is probably wrong but still gsp is delaying setting a date with bisping because he may be hearing that floyd mcgregor is just not going to happen and so would like the bigger fight and easier against conor bisping may also be hearing this and this is why the article came out yesterday that he will fight romero if gsp doesnt quickly set a date ie a bluff designed to put pressure on gsp a desperate move no doubt it just doesnt add up that gsp would spend so much time bulking for a middleweight fight and then need to figure out how to cut down to for a conor fight conor fighting gsp at would be retarded so basically my point is that gsp may be just on the point of no return with heading up to mw and the ufc needs to decide quickly what will happen with gsp bisping conor floyd and i bet some announcements will be coming shortly

MMA,not_removed,just rewatching the edgar vs maynard fight and how the fuck did yves lavigne not stop that fight in the first round im assuming the rules changed in terms of when a referee stops the fight because nowadays without a doubt that would be stopped after the second knockdown maybe even the first
MMA,not_removed,to clarify bellator tonite will still be broadcast with the tape delay for those of us on the west coast correct
MMA,not_removed,what do you guys think of the lions eat first slogan on a tshirt do you think the lions eat first thing has any legs or is it too nichebritish to gain much traction httpbitlymmareddit i quite like it but it might be a bit too fitspo can i please get some feedback on this tshirt design hope this isnt considered spammy thanks

MMA,not_removed,that fight is amazing but something about applauding and highfiving your opponent bothers me
MMA,not_removed,lytle was another guy who always had exciting fights not surprising him and robbie would put on a show together
MMA,not_removed,that when aldo had just gotten to rio de janeiro and couldnt afford dinner before bedtime he lived on the gym floor i believe he threw like one thousand leg kicks on a heavy bag with each leg in order to get so tired he couldnt feel he was hungry and had an easier time falling asleep
MMA,not_removed,nick diaz being high out of his gourd and submitting gomi with a gogoplata always got me lol
MMA,not_removed,theres a lot of great anderson silva ones like the one about him telling big nog that he was going to submit sonnen and big nog was like no youre going to knock him out silva was adamant no im going to submit him and thats just what happened

MMA,not_removed,check the date
MMA,not_removed,eternally even if the fight happens some day ill still feel disappointed about that moment and really its impossible not to considering it was the third time trying to book this
MMA,not_removed,im upset mainly because i just cant see where he goes from here biggest moment of his career and he fucked it up but with ramadan and scheduling theres a very real chance he might not fight this year and then where does that leave him could go down as one of the biggest what ifs in mma
MMA,not_removed,a part of my mma fanship died with that cancellation
MMA,not_removed,fucking khalabeeb i still cant get over that
MMA,not_removed,bbut i wanna complain to the hardworking mods for their effort
MMA,not_removed,not if you dont use res or whatever im stuck with this shit and its not even april yet
MMA,not_removed,we challenged ourselves to create the dirty love child of sherdog and

MMA,not_removed,they have the exact same smile
MMA,not_removed,anyone know what happened to tecia on snapchat she used to be flat out posting mundane af stuff mixed in with traininghanging out with rocky on her story all the time but not anymore
MMA,not_removed,theres always a girly one
MMA,not_removed,so youre saying hes waiting for floydconor to fall through and just fight conor
MMA,not_removed,would conor be easier than bisping
MMA,not_removed,gsp is delaying until april when the usada rules change so he can juice before the fight
MMA,not_removed,this is horrendous haha i wanna post this sub to rmildlyinfuriating now
MMA,not_removed,people are waking up to the truth
MMA,not_removed,april fools layout
MMA,not_removed,its the most japan fight on the card shes fighting king reina who carries a teddy bear i cant wait
MMA,not_removed,without clicking is it sage
MMA,not_removed,maybe he has autism and is just a savant at bjj hes certainly fucking awkward and a reason why he would try and copy conors schtick
MMA,not_removed,it is a glorious thing of beauty
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,fucking a who finally got a hold of him i tried for days after hearing him on the mma hour after his induction into the mma hof
MMA,not_removed,rampages contract automatically puts him in the ufc after this fight
MMA,not_removed,we need jones to restore order hell yeah bring back the king
MMA,not_removed,rampage has won his last fights even with facing lesser competition thats still super surprising to me
MMA,not_removed,just for you
MMA,not_removed,you are today
MMA,not_removed,donwvoet button this is rebook after all
MMA,not_removed,what is with the tiramisu memes lately what did i miss
MMA,not_removed,until further notice our new wmeimg partners had a focus meeting and decided this is the way they wanted to go forward with attracting new fans
MMA,not_removed,i thought the upvote graphic was a stack of books
MMA,not_removed,dan kelly theyre gonna be wrapping gold around that dad bod

MMA,not_removed,mcgregor everyone has written him off saying he will never defend but i think he will no one would expect that
MMA,not_removed,bisping via not defending the title in that span after beating gsp
MMA,not_removed,jorge masvidal
MMA,not_removed,gunner nelson and robert whittaker
MMA,not_removed,you gotta drink through that
MMA,not_removed,then dont drink too much
MMA,not_removed,same here im on a pretty sweet streak of mma every weekend and im pumped that bellator is coming to my rescue here to keep the streak going
MMA,not_removed,yousawduh
MMA,not_removed,usausausada
MMA,not_removed,us ay de ay
MMA,not_removed,youre saying it correctly
MMA,not_removed,clawjah gahdayla
MMA,not_removed,dc matches up well with yoel
MMA,not_removed,dc disparity in size would be too much
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck if you find it please report back because ive never heard this story also its chael so its probably horseshit but im not gonna lie and say i dont wanna hear it
MMA,not_removed,rumble and weidman
MMA,not_removed,oh dc by a mile dude rumble has one shot on him always bet against that
MMA,not_removed,dc and moose for me jesus weidman could be going since losing the belt although it would be losses to straight up killers little bit of odds fluctuation recently so hes coming in as the underdog now too
MMA,not_removed,not too bad just get there early that card is stacked
MMA,not_removed,i always recommend front row of the upper bowl you get a good view down onto the action but more importantly youll have a straigh shot to the bigscreen which you will be looking at frequently having to look up all night sucks
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,i miss the regular guy frank does a great job though
MMA,not_removed,would lllove to see this but theres no way nate takes this fight doesnt make any financial sense when hes got a guaranteed rematch with conor at some point
MMA,not_removed,its no fun without a fight card i feel you i cant even watch bellator tonight i hate that so many of their cards are on friday
MMA,not_removed,look at the day tomorrow i guess
MMA,not_removed,i dont see an edmund cursor at all
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,where is this series of gifs

MMA,not_removed,please dont give the mods anymore ideas
MMA,not_removed,interesting autocorrect bellator main card starts est with prelims starting est if youre on the west coast like me bellator main card airs tapedelayed at pst
MMA,not_removed,i would rather have aldo land a perfect shot so we get a sec double ko
MMA,not_removed,ufc is an upcoming mixed martial arts event that will be held by the ultimate fighting championship on july at tmobile arena in las vegas nevada
MMA,not_removed,if he was lean and conditioned it would be an advantage but hes just out of shape i am taking a side in this fight but my side is the under rounds at im thinking rampage overextends gasses and gets finished late round or early round theres no good reason to take my advice but there it is
MMA,not_removed,pounds is a ridiculous amount of weight pretty sure hell gas after the first round but you never know might go for the hail mary rampage first round kotkostoppage at
MMA,not_removed,ive been to a couple of these shows i don understand the second question tho the first round was interesting the second round was soso and the rest was boring its been boring ever since if thats what you mean

MMA,not_removed,his loss to brad pickett was a damn good scrap if im remembering correctly
MMA,not_removed,we all just keyboard warriors here mate
MMA,not_removed,im using some title ones and some ringside ones that i found off of amazon and theyre fine
MMA,not_removed,title are good but theyre fairly broad
MMA,not_removed,people blamed khabibs weight problems at on him eating some tiramisu on embedded i didnt bother checking it out at the time but some people suggested he was actually pictured eating it earlier but either way the tiramisu meme stuck with tony ferguson even posting recently about tiramisu tuesday
MMA,not_removed,i have to agree with you and wtf is he doing fighting at he looks so out of shape
MMA,not_removed,rampage has a solid chin
MMA,not_removed,on another note i can guarantee king mo has either already tried or will try to be a rapper in the near future
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,sure screenshot it and send to buzznightsgmailcom
MMA,not_removed,the odds of me blaming you if he pulls out are fuckin percent ill tell you that much
MMA,not_removed,you shut your mouth
MMA,not_removed,hey how bout you shut the fuck up with that evil talk
MMA,not_removed,just dont
MMA,not_removed,i mean hes only pulled out twice
MMA,not_removed,you mean wwe style wrestling right

MMA,not_removed,hell yes im all in on all the marvel netflix series for good now daredevil is by far tops but the production quality of the others are still so great is there room for criticisms of course but i mean theres no reason to have crazy expectations for these very fun series i cant wait for the next one

MMA,not_removed,watch hagglerhearns and the gattiward trilogy
MMA,not_removed,definitely top probably not top
MMA,not_removed,roughly est
MMA,not_removed,i dont know man yeah the knockdowns were bad but i think they looked worse than they really were due to edgar bleeding plus maynard being so much bigger than him i would argue that cruz getting knocked down times by garbrandt in round of their bout was worse since cruz looked like he legit shut off on one of them for a split second but i dont think anyone had a problem with that bout continuing
MMA,not_removed,the design is exactly the same as the second image that comes up when you google gay pride equality logo
MMA,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofufceventsscheduledevents july is ufc in anaheim week before that theyre in nassau and nothing set yet in august doubtful theyll be in vegas if they do schedule something that first weekend of august its possible i suppose but i wouldnt get your hopes up that said im sure there will be lots of vegas bars and such that will show the ppv which isnt too bad of an alternative especially when enhanced with a trip to the sports book to up the stakes and enhance the fun
MMA,not_removed,hate to break it to you but this is permanent

MMA,not_removed,the entire future of the lw division is a blur at this point
MMA,not_removed,khabib died for us
MMA,not_removed,its crippling to hear people malign edmond in this way
MMA,not_removed,the hardworking mods who had to spend hours staring at edmonds mug
MMA,not_removed,so does that mean posting tranny porn is okay as long as it is mma themed
MMA,not_removed,i really hope you failed then because that sounds horrifying
MMA,not_removed,i think that there may be a chance obviously im speculating that gsp already knows that it fell through and so is waiting to hear from conor to see if hes a fight that he conor wants
MMA,not_removed,yes its not even a question in my opinion but ill explain my position if you want me to
MMA,not_removed,more money
MMA,not_removed,go for it youre on a list
MMA,not_removed,lol i didnt know that so excited i hope the teddy bear is bigger than her
MMA,not_removed,i grew up around kids that acted like youth pastors no problem with that kid but the way danis speaks and his eyes not exactly aligning something off haha
MMA,not_removed,all of a sudden my striking is world class i could beat mayweather
MMA,not_removed,im out of the loop what has tiramisu got to do with rmma
MMA,not_removed,lol
MMA,not_removed,fight pass offered him up to us
MMA,not_removed,really thats a weird contract i should look it up
MMA,not_removed,thanks buzz but seriously is this permanent
MMA,not_removed,khabib missed weight and was seen eating tiramisu on an episode of embedded days before the fight
MMA,not_removed,khabib was in a restaurant during an episode of embedded with a plate of tiramisu we didnt see him eat any but we blame it for him missing weight for the ferguson fight
MMA,not_removed,khabib was seen eating tiramisu during a ufc embedded when he was cutting weight for his fight against tony ferguson
MMA,not_removed,khabib eating tiramisu then missing weight
MMA,not_removed,khabib missed weight and we blame the tiramisu he ate on the embedded theyve since edited that out lol
MMA,not_removed,just in case it wasnt clear khalibib ate some tiramisu
MMA,not_removed,but a stack of books isnt comedy genius tiramisu however is
MMA,not_removed,mma fans arent wellread meryl streep
MMA,not_removed,if dan kelly somehow managed to win the title it would have to be the greatest underdog story in mma history
MMA,not_removed,i hate how loosely people use dad bod the dude isnt sage but is not a dad bod
MMA,not_removed,rivera was gonna be my choice that boy is nasty
MMA,not_removed,maia has got to retire for that to happen
MMA,not_removed,aw my mom used to say that
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,dc is not that much bigger and thats mostly just his doughy physique
MMA,not_removed,nah this ones actually real theres a video of his mother telling the story as well
MMA,not_removed,if you have fightpass i found it here
MMA,not_removed,yeah but rumbles one shot is one hell of a shot
MMA,not_removed,hes got nasty high kicks too though
MMA,not_removed,theyre my favorite active fighters at mw and it has me very conflicted i dont want moose to lose his momentum but i dont want weidman to go on that tough of a skid gonna be hard to enjoy that fight
MMA,not_removed,for sure im getting there right when the gates open
MMA,not_removed,yeah i was thinking about getting seats up there i was just worried it was too high up
MMA,not_removed,appreciate it
MMA,not_removed,oh ok im in the uk so its march for me
MMA,not_removed,its very difficult to find ufc events in leeds much less bellator ones wish i had more rmma leeds bros to trek to the bar with
MMA,not_removed,if youre on the west coast like me bellator main card airs tapedelayed at pst not airing your sports event live is a great way to grow the sport scott
MMA,not_removed,then we have another month world tour where they argue over who lost consciousness first
MMA,not_removed,nice whats the largest flying bird
MMA,not_removed,why would anyone find this interesting i simply dont get it knights fighting in a half ringhalf cage with a ref
MMA,not_removed,thanks dude thats what was putting me off cant see him getting kod but maybe getting gassed and a tko stoppage i was thinking didnt look the greatest at the weigh ins
MMA,not_removed,and his striking defense has typically be decent his boxing defense in particular is actually very good imo
MMA,not_removed,haha thanks ill do my best
MMA,not_removed,hes only used it twice but his team at aka drill it all the time so he could definitely utilise it
MMA,not_removed,rumble will turn it down again
MMA,not_removed,of course he does whats more deadly a take down or a cold stone stunner brother
MMA,not_removed,jessica jones is my favorite so far also all of them have had bad aspects but none of them have been bad iron fist included theyre all pretty fuckin far from perfect tho
MMA,not_removed,mo memes mo problems im messing of course great execution haha i particularly enjoy edmonds eyes in the search bar
MMA,not_removed,i want a team hendo flair but there isnt any so im going to take team rumble instead
MMA,not_removed,yeah theyre amazing seen them already wardgatti is what got me interested
MMA,not_removed,awesome thanks
MMA,not_removed,thanks
MMA,not_removed,nice im not a gambling man but i just might have to bet on some fights hopefully i dont win so much i get banned from participating
MMA,not_removed,fuckin momo
MMA,not_removed,we dont let our dreams be dreams in this subreddit
MMA,not_removed,its my fault they added a bunch of random scripting to whats generally a bare bones site ok
MMA,not_removed,bro
MMA,not_removed,cool
MMA,not_removed,i know some friendsteammates that have lived in the gym for a couple months id think most gym owners are chill about it if you are dedicated and clean
MMA,not_removed,she talks about it a lot
MMA,not_removed,yeah i know im impressed buzz yall went all out on this one
MMA,not_removed,i tip my tapout fedora to you
MMA,not_removed,pffft yeah fuck me for commenting on the topic at hand such a hipster
MMA,not_removed,a number two number with cheese and a large soda
MMA,not_removed,big wire fan actually if sopranos maintains its current level of quality through the end yeah best ever imo which would bump the wire down to behind mad men and just above deadwood no accounting for taste i guess it is about time i researched the wire though i watched it as a teenager its been many years edit rewatched not researched fucking autocorrect
MMA,not_removed,deadwood is up there rome i have not seen alsoi stand by my possibly best ever statement but by far was a bit much im prone to hyperbole recencybias and whatnot
MMA,not_removed,i didnt get any this time but for original i like their custom saucechick fil a saucei eat it plain for spicy
MMA,not_removed,day
MMA,not_removed,through some kind of divine intervention he could make but all signs point to that not happening he apparently wants to fight for the gold in augustseptember but theres also the dilemma with ufc possibly being reluctant to book him again period not just with tony so id say theres a good chance he wont even fight until
MMA,not_removed,nah dude khabib died for tiramasu
MMA,not_removed,yo one day can we have threads about specific fighters i would love to see all the info and knowledge this sub has to come together and give us the ultimate fun facts and we could fact check easily book it mods
MMA,not_removed,you have to respect it i cant look at my cursor for more than seconds without hearing head mooment head mooment h head mooment
MMA,not_removed,not that dirty
MMA,not_removed,à² à² 
MMA,not_removed,please do
MMA,not_removed,i cant wait to see rin nakai fly into the ring with angel wings
MMA,not_removed,beewwdiful champ
MMA,not_removed,dropping olympic boxers with body shots
MMA,not_removed,khabib ate tiramisu on embedded a day before the weigh in and then was hospitalized in the middle of the night because the cut went wrong
MMA,not_removed,yeah i made a mistake of asking goodrich to get a hold of him before i knew how bad his dementia is i still cringe thinking about it
MMA,not_removed,it was a weird situation he wanted to go back to the ufc and he claimed that bellator hadnt fulfilled some of their contractual duties mostly related to promotion and advertising so his contract was void he came back to the ufc for fight fabio malbababo while he was in legal proceeding with bellator either the court found against him or he decided not to continue pursuing it so now hes back to finish his contract
MMA,not_removed,its april fools in some parts of the world
MMA,not_removed,ah i thought it was more than that at least he didnt eat a quarter pounder and then miss weight by a quarter pound
MMA,not_removed,he calls himself a dad bod
MMA,not_removed,oh shit he has that weird shoulder bump that ive got anyone know what its called
MMA,not_removed,ah the champion
MMA,not_removed,regardless dc wins his chin is phenomenal and he has the stamina to grind it out i think romero would fade assuming its a round fight also dc being an olympiclevel wrestler himself would not have to worry about being outgrappled with his size advantage i dont see any path to victory for yoel
MMA,not_removed,romero is jacked but his frame is much more slender than dcs
MMA,not_removed,oh i agree but its like betting on the team that hits more homeruns vs the team with great pitching
MMA,not_removed,yeah same they probably did it today to make it less obvious straight away or it might be april in america timezones are shit
MMA,not_removed,that would still be entertaining as fuck
MMA,not_removed,deandra sweet dee reynolds is the bartender at paddys pub she is the twin sister of dennis reynolds and the legal daughter of frank and barbara reynolds dee considers herself a member of the gang that runs paddys although the rest of the gang often disagrees with this assertion
MMA,not_removed,and the ref often dresses like a medieval page or squire i cannot answer the question i simply do not know its turgid repetitive and boring i honestly think its probably just an extended toiletcigarette break for audience
MMA,not_removed,because theyre different from you and probably have different interests thats the safest bet anyway
MMA,not_removed,its rounds right maybe if it was
MMA,not_removed,i loved the villain in jessica jones that really made the series for me gotta love a good villian donofrio cast as kingpin though really made daredevil a home run for me though thought he killed that role as good as any actor in a villain role and yeah they have their negatives but so does plenty of good stuff too and yeah id go farther than saying none of them have been bad and say theyre all pretty fun and entertaining and honor the comics very well
MMA,not_removed,mike perry in the background makes me laugh hope you had a good vacation
MMA,not_removed,what would team hendo be for is what im asking
MMA,not_removed,exact same mickey ward made me a boxing fan
MMA,not_removed,on several fights shouldnt break the bank but it will help get you invested especially for fights where you dont know one or either fighter parlays are fun too small investment but big payoff if everything goes your way if you spread those out the anticipation can build even more
MMA,not_removed,not bangcock ready
MMA,not_removed,no its your fault youre stuck in its ok bro i use netscape toowith my free aol cd
MMA,not_removed,uchillingintheporkfat did the design and ueuric did the implementationtroubleshooting the rest of us just booed and hissed from the sidelines
MMA,not_removed,thats alright im prone to nostalgiadriven statements so deadwood oz the wire give me the warm fuzzies also the shield oh just figured out what i want to rewatch now
MMA,not_removed,where did you hear he wants the fight in augsept
MMA,not_removed,thats a really good idea like a fighter feature
MMA,not_removed,chilling did the css thats dedication to the sub to stare at his face for so long lol
MMA,not_removed,oh so you mean edit probably nsfw or lunch
MMA,not_removed,he did say dirty and
MMA,not_removed,lmao i just cant want to hear the first rings of lena hardts glorious soothing voice screaming in my ears again her voice is the soundtrack to my fucking life
MMA,not_removed,i wouldnt sweat it im excited to see what he has to say
MMA,not_removed,ah gotcha thanks buzz
MMA,not_removed,in oz so that might be it america is behind us oz infront
MMA,not_removed,he said flying bird though shes landlocked for sure
MMA,not_removed,turgid it is in the morning and i cant sleep but your verbiage has made it all worthwhile
MMA,not_removed,nah man i respect everyones interests but this just butchers two things on knight fights and mma
MMA,not_removed,kingpin was the only good thing about the first season mainly i disliked how they handled foggy he seemed far weaker and less assertive than in the comicsthe ones i happened to read anyway he was my favorite character in the comics and my least favorite in the show
MMA,not_removed,thanks buzz visited iceland for a few days it was wonderful back just in time to try to stay awake for the king morampage fight
MMA,not_removed,haha shit i just saw the mayweather face for the spoiler lol
MMA,not_removed,for ppl who support dan henderson
MMA,not_removed,guess i should have figured as much people are assholes about their browsers have fun with yours buddeh
MMA,not_removed,why tiramisu e oh khalabeeb
MMA,not_removed,the shield is something i really need to give a shot my pops watched it while it was airing but it seemed pretty standard to me at the time but ive seen it praised so heavily and i doubt i watched it with a keen eye present day self and teenage self have vastly different opinions on lots of shit so i should probably stop trusting that guys judgment
MMA,not_removed,according to okamoto and khabibs manager i think abdulmanap said the same stuff too
MMA,not_removed,yeah is it already a thing people come up with some wacky shit in the comments and i always want more origin of the meme or at least a lil storycontext would be a great way to draw lurkers out into commenting not like you need more of that haha
MMA,not_removed,nsfw
MMA,not_removed,thats quite something
MMA,not_removed,rampage vs manuwa or osp might be cool
MMA,not_removed,forrest cant brush his teeth without shoulder pain from what i hear he aint fighting again bro
MMA,not_removed,you like
MMA,not_removed,dont think about spooky ghosts or goblins
MMA,not_removed,sounds awesome to me maybe im easily impressed shrugs
MMA,not_removed,cmon thats way too harsh if even on a minimal level of these shows are fun action genre and are not meant for crazy expectations going in i thought the dude who plays daredevil is pretty great and the chick who play karen is super hot and good too and i mean there was a lot of kingpin in season but i gotta say you just blew my mind with your foggy comment i didnt read much of the daredevil comics and i hated foggy so much in this series too a dude at my gym acted like that was true to the comics but my god he was such a whiny whiny bitch i mean i understand the character storyline for him and his perspective even a bit but i thought it was over the top so youre really changing my opinion from that perspective hopefully it was just a bit of a long character arc and now hell have a bit more backbone somewhat bc he could still be a likeable character and annoying at the same time
MMA,not_removed,oh ok generally the team flair is used for upcoming fights that was the only confusion
MMA,not_removed,khabib missed weight but was on embedded eating tiramisu tiramisu killed
MMA,not_removed,ahhhwell if a miracle happens and they do meet at it would make the card better its already pretty damn stacked
MMA,not_removed,i like it ill take it back to the mod team
MMA,not_removed,more like not safe for lunch
MMA,not_removed,manuwa would probably ko rampage these days but i reckon hed still be able to beat osp
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,what about ghouls little green ghouls
MMA,not_removed,yeah man in the comics hes actually matts foil the yin to his yang a strong character worth respecting whos actions and word make a difference not just some lovable fuckup cliche who occasionally has a moment of brilliance that redeems him hes no crybaby hes a good man great lawyerand way more competent in general it makes their relationship actually interesting and i get what youre saying about being too hard on it but standards change quick we get spoiled easily when the first spiderman flick came out of it was a goddamn godsend to see a well made pretty close to thw source material flick but it was good at that time doesnt necessarily make it great forever yknow much like mma its a what have you done for me lately business and even if i enjoy the shows we arent going to be talking about their greatness later we might still be talking about kingpins performance tho that is whats gonna stand out
MMA,not_removed,lol i was messing with you i know what u meant theres no real reason he should have a flair atm but it would be cool to have legends who are retired
MMA,not_removed,thanks so much buzz
MMA,not_removed,its way funnier when you run edmonds face up and down the picture
MMA,not_removed,probably but it would be a fun match to watch
MMA,not_removed,dislikes peoples knees
MMA,not_removed,very interesting sounds like they did fuck up his character then i wouldnt have minded a little bit of crybabyness out of him but it was too much for too long with not much else from him sounds like you know your comics well and i hear ya stuff can become very dated with time but ill always remember that spiderman for dafoe and just as youve pointed out i think kingpin will live on too but i think its just always important to keep expectations reasonable i mean some of the superhero movies were botched i never watched the andrew garfield spidermans bc they looked so terrible hopefully the new reboot will be good ill give it a shot bc iron man will be in it im just saying netflix is getting my thumbs up for all of them and daredevil so far im excited for the defenders should be pretty fun
MMA,not_removed,i was messing with you mission accomplished
MMA,not_removed,he just got done saying not that dirty jesus christ
MMA,not_removed,id definitely watch it
MMA,not_removed,if youre gonna be walking around cover your knees up
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,the fight i didnt know i wanted that ive been waiting my entire life for
MMA,not_removed,shame because i am a fan of both
MMA,not_removed,sexyhara about to get them irish bitches
MMA,not_removed,sbg v team alpha male
MMA,not_removed,hon mayo
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,oh thats a fun fight
MMA,not_removed,tam vs sbg in disguise
MMA,not_removed,teruto looks like hes trying to do dominic cruz style except he gets tagged x more
MMA,not_removed,atta boy artem
MMA,not_removed,tough fight for artem but im excited for this
MMA,not_removed,stylistically this is a good fight for artem dont count him out
MMA,not_removed,this is a great fight between two fighters that earned stardom outside of the cage who will it take it will ishiharas bitches bombard lobovs short arms or will lobov keep it flowy long enough to drop the russian hammer idk but i am hyped for the leadup and the shit talking
MMA,not_removed,war iloveyoumybitches
MMA,not_removed,oh yes
MMA,not_removed,war yashabo
MMA,not_removed,hahahaha cant believe they made this fight artem is going to get smashed
MMA,not_removed,im more looking forward to ishiharas instagram after the fight with pics of hot irish chicks
MMA,not_removed,irish bitchez bout to get drenched ð¦ð¦ð¦
MMA,not_removed,interesting fight artem has only been stopped by punches once never kod then again teruto is maybe the hardest hitter in fw right now
MMA,not_removed,wow this guy is really stretching out his opportunity in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,holy shit artem is gonna get rekt
MMA,not_removed,i dont know who to root for
MMA,not_removed,i hope artem knocks him into next year just to spite everyone here shitting on him
MMA,not_removed,i was hoping that ishihara was gonna appear at the melbourne card hope he beats lobov
MMA,not_removed,this will be a fun fight and someone is getting kod a lot of people in here seem to be sold on teruto for some reason this is a coin flip fight imo two sloppy but powerful strikers that will brawl it out a perfect matchup for artems extremely limited skill set and trex arms
MMA,not_removed,i never knew i wanted this so badly
MMA,not_removed,will be a good fight im scared for artem but you gotta take the tough fights
MMA,not_removed,damn thats a great matchup
MMA,not_removed,the fight i really want to see is krazy h i mean felony charles bennett who is wins losses fight artem who is wins and losses
MMA,not_removed,come on ishihara cant wait to see him put it all on the line for his belfast bitches
MMA,not_removed,we talk a lot about people riding conors coat tails but artem is the epitome of this dude got booted from tuf and dana just decided to bring back one guy from each team in the next ep
MMA,not_removed,king artem
MMA,not_removed,theyre fighting over a woman or women
MMA,not_removed,yessssss
MMA,not_removed,ohhhhhhhh yeah going to be fun
MMA,not_removed,go my bitches
MMA,not_removed,i love fire crotch bitches
MMA,not_removed,can we get a team ilovemybitches flair
MMA,not_removed,is it the where my bitches at dude vs t rexmma
MMA,not_removed,shit this is a kind of a step up from chris avila
MMA,not_removed,nooo i dont want these to fight i mean i do but i dont im so conflicted either way bitches will be had
MMA,not_removed,after ishihara wins this fight expect a population surge in ireland months from now
MMA,not_removed,lobov looked pretty damn good in his last fight calculated worked the leg didnt overextend on anything ishihara is pretty aggressive which works directly into lobovs game this should be a scrap
MMA,not_removed,how the fuck is this guy still employed lmao i think of him as the butler guy to conor ala puff daddy
MMA,not_removed,you should never rule anything out in mma but im pretty pleased about ishihara getting such an easy opponent
MMA,not_removed,well i guess it had to end eventually
MMA,not_removed,im so happy for the cronies of money draws
MMA,not_removed,artem the guy who hasnt improved in fights will be a fun smash by teru
MMA,not_removed,belfast is fake ireland
MMA,not_removed,wow thats an interesting fight lol you basically set up one guy to win and fight their first low ranked opponent next
MMA,not_removed,so ufc is done with conors friend apparently
MMA,not_removed,ya this is a tough fight i like artem but i dont see him winning this one either way its definitely going to be an awesome fight to watch
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,how does he keep talking about looking for women unless hes not into asians like these obviously he has no problems attracting them
MMA,not_removed,yeah this fight sucks in that respect
MMA,not_removed,travis browne like is is ishiharas speedo joe
MMA,not_removed,where all the ginger women at
MMA,not_removed,hello all my makkuguregaa bitches
MMA,not_removed,aisling daleys body is ready
MMA,not_removed,i dont know if belfast girls are his type
MMA,not_removed,sbg are currently
MMA,not_removed,ishiharas from castlebar hes taking over the hill on sunday
MMA,not_removed,they will break the curse im telln ye
MMA,not_removed,why cant he just become his left hand man nvm dana already took that position
MMA,not_removed,and hits like harder
MMA,not_removed,psst artem nice and flowy
MMA,not_removed,i agree hahahahahah come with me baaabaayyokay
MMA,not_removed,if you actually think ishihara is a legit prospect you should take a closer look at the guy
MMA,not_removed,theyd consider him a creep and tell him to fuck off
MMA,not_removed,youre thinking of dooho choi and jeremy stephens is the hardest hitter in the fw division didnt you hear
MMA,not_removed,he looked terrible avila just happened to be on a whole other level of terrible
MMA,not_removed,i think the savage leg kicks he showed at are evidence of improvement dont you
MMA,not_removed,wait what
MMA,not_removed,word
MMA,not_removed,its definitely going to be entertaining though both fighters love to stand and bang
MMA,not_removed,i think experience a power could win artem this one yer man comes forward and shoots from halfway across the cage of he wants a takedown now artem comes straight forward too and himself likes that slipping counter right hook when he is backing up i give the edge to artem but it could go either way easily enough
MMA,not_removed,we have ourselves a fight
MMA,not_removed,those are just two wigs held up on sticks lol bae caught artem slipping
MMA,not_removed,is he trying a holly holm cosplay with those wigs or something
MMA,not_removed,you always want more
MMA,not_removed,he wants that white pussy upgrade
MMA,not_removed,bababababababah nobody understand what youre saying dude
MMA,not_removed,teruto sam
MMA,not_removed,no man can take that left hand
MMA,not_removed,dom favors not getting hit over producing power not exciting some of the time but keeps him safe and wins fights
MMA,not_removed,are we still pretending cruz doesnt hit hard after watching him repeatedly drop faber im pretty sure its cruzs style that prevents him from loading up on shots not cruzs ability itself
MMA,not_removed,out of every prospect at fw hes the worst but were talking about artem here the dude is just not good he shouldnt even be in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,i think artem is about to get fucked up
MMA,not_removed,why do you say this
MMA,not_removed,theyll do nuttin
MMA,not_removed,im just basing it on their punchko wins terutos got against chois terutos also had less fights
MMA,not_removed,dooho choi is likely an all around harder hitter but yashabos counter left cross is fucking dynamite and maybe the biggest bomb in the division sans connor the way he counters he just loads up on that thing no real evidence based against top tier guys from either choi or ishihara though
MMA,not_removed,not sure if youre kidding but stephens probably is the hardest hitter at fw
MMA,not_removed,anyone can look good with that caliber of opponent
MMA,not_removed,dude what artem is most certainly the underdog in this fight
MMA,not_removed,but in his interviews he makes it sound like he couldnt get any thus he chose mma
MMA,not_removed,if i wasnt poor id guild you
MMA,not_removed,doms movement is exciting as fuck its incredible to watch
MMA,not_removed,not denying cruz cant hit hard to clarify i meant historically not potentially if you got both of them in front of a heavybag rigged with sensors id say teruto would only hit marginally harder than cruz and thats mostly due to his size but his track record would say his style allows for more power shots
MMA,not_removed,its the same thing as floyd mayweather anyone can load up and knock a guy out look at what floyd did with one shot combo against victor ortiz when he planted and threw he could do that to anyone but he never threw the shots as it wasnt his style the one time he knew he could load up and throw with no risk however he knocked the guy cold same goes for cruz if he planted his feet and threw he could certainly floor other bws he doesnt tend to plant his feet and throw though
MMA,not_removed,also cruz has been fighting literally the contender for years the only one contender he did not fight he finished in a minute
MMA,not_removed,hes called decisionator for a reason
MMA,not_removed,cruz doesnt hit hard though
MMA,not_removed,artem got into the ufc by being a runner up in tuf ishihara got into the ufc by drawing in the finale of tuf japan their mutual opponent is julian erosa and they both knocked him out honestly their skill level is not that far apart at all people are acting like this is some a chad mendes vs cody mckenzie kind of fight it isnt
MMA,not_removed,if lobov is worse then isnt he the worst fw prospect
MMA,not_removed,me too
MMA,not_removed,teru is better
MMA,not_removed,against way worse guys
MMA,not_removed,ishihara has a much higher ceiling but i think he is pretty hittable in his striking defence while artem has the power to put him down i still think it works the other way and ishihara can still catch him when artem is coming straight forward i just favour artem a small shade more
MMA,not_removed,and now he gets plenty as evidenced by the picture
MMA,not_removed,eloquent comeback coined by our beloved chad mendes
MMA,not_removed,youd an association of people for mutual aid or the pursuit of a common goal him
MMA,not_removed,not saying it isnt the causal fan doesnt appreciate it doingwatching footwork is my favorite thing about striking edit should of worded my previous post better causal fans say its boring same with floyd even the same with mcgs fight with diaz
MMA,not_removed,except for the fact that hes going after the bw instead of the clear contender right now
MMA,not_removed,artem got into the ufc by riding mcgregors coattails he shouldnt have even made it to the house and he shouldve been cut after getting destroyed by alex white when have you ever seen a tuf product go and not get cut
MMA,not_removed,i think what hes saying is that artem isnt a prospect
MMA,not_removed,nah id say prospect implies they will get better
MMA,not_removed,really how do you know this
MMA,not_removed,ishihara is at the low end of fw prospects artem is straight up doesnotevenbelongintheufc terrible
MMA,not_removed,flair checks out
MMA,not_removed,theres guessing and then theres guessing anything without hard data is technically a guess like itd be a guess for me to say rumble would probably beat cody garbrandt in a fight
MMA,not_removed,already beat him
MMA,not_removed,oh yeah that makes sense i was being a bit to literal
MMA,not_removed,because i follow the sport take their last two fights sam sicilia and tavares are decent mid tier guys and doo ho choi starched them ishiharas last two fights are against horatio gutierrez and julian erosa two cans
MMA,not_removed,hes probably the second worst fighter in recent ufc history behind dufresne
MMA,not_removed,that fight with avila was terrible i mean avilas excuse was he had no major fight experience but i think any other ufc featherweight would have finished that fight
MMA,not_removed,barely in an incredibly close decision that dana and lorenzo both gave to tj
MMA,not_removed,interesting that youd call julian erosa a can but sam losses in last a decent mid tier guy looking at their opponents preufc seem to show that theyve faced a quite even level of opponents in that regard as well so im not really buying the way worse opponent thing
MMA,not_removed,dufresne just tapped out marloes coenen on short notice lol
MMA,not_removed,well avila lost to artem soo
MMA,not_removed,does cm punk count
MMA,not_removed,cm punk
MMA,not_removed,makes no difference who they thought won cruz still won nothing wrong with him fighting cody and then rematch tj
MMA,not_removed,julian erosa is a tuf washout that was cut after the ishihara loss and gutierrez has lost like or in a row sam sicilia at least has wins over a few ufc guys and has been in the organization for a while i highly doubt teruto would beat tavares and sicilia would probably give him a tough fight win or lose
MMA,not_removed,indeed inconsistency is a consistent feature of the womens divisions
MMA,not_removed,avila is more of a sacrificial lamb than a ufc fighter
MMA,not_removed,second worst fighter sorry phil
MMA,not_removed,aside from the fact that it makes it a joke of a sport then yea i guess dillashaw has earned the fight he went and shut down the contender with ease he deserves the shit much more than garbrandt who beat and
MMA,not_removed,if you dont count those two fights hes still in the lead for kos
MMA,not_removed,apparently a lot of the mens divisions as well those belts get passed around or not defended like hot potatoes
MMA,not_removed,move them goalposts baby
MMA,not_removed,nah not really dillashaw had a shot at cruz and he lost cruz seems to want to fight someone else cody before having a rematch with tj as long as the rematch happens within cruzs next two fights i dont think it makes the sport a joke at all
MMA,not_removed,somewhat i mean when a serra beats a gsp its a massively unexpected upset when a dufresne beats a coenen youre all yeah thatll happen
MMA,not_removed,i in no way saw that happening tbh then again im biased as a fan of marloes
MMA,not_removed,dude same here one of my longtime mma regrets is that coenen couldnt make without impacting her performance
MMA,not_removed,he was at one point but he has definitely slipped up a bunch recently personally i think big john does a better job and marc goddard even better still
MMA,not_removed,rockhold and weidman both wanted the fight stood up because it was a clear stalemate just because rogan complains about it doesnt mean it is a bad call
MMA,not_removed,id say marc goddard is the best ref
MMA,not_removed,except for weidman vs rockhold which was ridiculously late ive disliked dean for a while now and this is why besides weidman there was ufc when mike pyle beat a helpless tj waldburger and rogan yelled hes out this fight is over herb needs to stop this fight and i dont know why herb dean is not stopping this fight for over a minute at bellator georgi karakhanyan had to practically beg dean to end the fight after he had bubba jenkins in a guillotine for seconds after passing out the way jenkins eyes roll back is not real comfortable to look at httpsvidmeiblm at he actually touched cains shoulder to end the fight vs jds but then changed his mind while jds stood there propped against the fence out on his feet i think it was earlier this year when joe lauzon simply got up and walked away after takanori gomi went out before dean got around to stopping the fight the guy is gonna get someone seriously hurt at some point if he hasnt already can anyone really fully recover after taking a beating to the head like weidman did
MMA,not_removed,free josh rosenthal
MMA,not_removed,imo hes pretty inconsistent some times he makes great calls and other times not so much id say mark goddard is one of the best refs right now
MMA,not_removed,ya herb is overrated pretty inconsistent the little ref with the blue gloves is doing good right now prospect ref
MMA,not_removed,josh rosenthal gets my vote he has really high standards
MMA,not_removed,sweet dreads obvi
MMA,not_removed,of all the refs i dont recall ever seeing jason herzog fuck up i think hes probably one of the better ones if not the best imo
MMA,not_removed,faber barao was a good stoppage im tired of hearing this you need to fight not cling onto a leg and thumbs up while blocking punches
MMA,not_removed,herb is good hes my number to big john though i also like that aussie guy who dishes out rugby style litigious refereeing
MMA,not_removed,monsieur dean is pretty rad but when it comes to the manwoman who can take control of the octagon and keep both competitors in check httpsimgurcomaamjyc are the king and queen of mma refereeing
MMA,not_removed,i still think herb is the best referee he lets the boys go at it and i think he knows when to stop the fights
MMA,not_removed,isnt big john a paid ufc shill though
MMA,not_removed,it was definitely a weird moment too because rogan said only a few seconds prior they need to move or herb is gonna stand them up then herb stood them up and rogan said wow i cant believe he did that
MMA,not_removed,why would weidman want the fight stood up when you are basically in side control and your opponent still wont give up the guillotine you basically have a dominant position you just have to edge it out its actually kind of a white belt move to not let go of the guillotine when you dont have any kind of guard
MMA,not_removed,yep he dosnt get the recognizion he deserves and also that bearded dude is pretty good too
MMA,not_removed,goddards calls are good but he calls for action way too much and way too early literally the moment a fight hits the fence he stays telling them to work etc tends towards early standups too
MMA,not_removed,its true that refing seems to be moving towards letting fights go on a bit too long sometimes we get an amazing recovery and comeback but typically we just get a guy being beat while unconscious i dont think its herbs fault however i think most refs are letting fights go a bit longer and that this is how they are getting instructed by the ufc now i know people are going to jump in and scream about refs being independent but the truth is they do what the ufc wants or they dont work in front of a camera
MMA,not_removed,i think herb dean is a horrible ref that cain fight should have been stopped and those other ones were stopped too late
MMA,not_removed,tbh georgi karakhanyan shouldve just let go earlier instead of just yelling hes out it wouldve taken him a while regain consciousness at that point anyways herb was already trying to get him to let go right before he started yelling so he was only late seconds not as bad as weidman vs rockhold where it shouldve ended a full round before
MMA,not_removed,lay off the herb dean
MMA,not_removed,dont forget that fight night a month or two ago when he showed up wearing some nilkes and actually refd a prelim match or two in them but once the main card started he was rocking a brand new pair of black on black reeboks lets hope he got his reebok payout for the night
MMA,not_removed,i really really regret that hes not reffing he was a phenomenal official definitely one of the best in the country when he was sent away
MMA,not_removed,i think i see what you did there
MMA,not_removed,completely agree a thumbs up doesnt mean shit if youre getting blasted but staying conscious youre gonna get the fight stopped its why there is a tko
MMA,not_removed,i heard he kneed aldo in the head on purpose at ufc to make sure he didnt get back up thats some eddie bravo conspiracy level shit right there take that back its way worse
MMA,not_removed,lmao aldo wasnt getting back up he was asleep
MMA,not_removed,funniest shit ive read in a long time
MMA,not_removed,nah i think he has pretty rocky relationship with dana tbh
MMA,not_removed,decent troll definitely have some of these suckers going though
MMA,not_removed,yeah rogan annoyed me in that instance weidman rockhold and the fans in the arena all wanted it stood up
MMA,not_removed,not sure but if you watch weidmans body language he motions for the fight to be stood up
MMA,not_removed,mike beltran looks like he should go on a quest with some hobbits and elves
MMA,not_removed,mike beltran hes a great ref
MMA,not_removed,i agree with this hes gotten better but earlier on he would not give guys any time to work on the ground
MMA,not_removed,i dont think its herbs fault however i think most refs are letting fights go a bit longer and that this is how they are getting instructed by the ufc thats certainly not impossible as i said before i havent liked dean in some time i think hes dangerous maybe i just see it more with him because i look for it
MMA,not_removed,what makes dean even worse is that the superfast rouseymcmann stoppage you mentioned was at about minutes after he stood there and watched waldburger get head trauma if he were a guy that called things fast out of concerns for fighter safety that would be great id even probably agree most of the time but hes not theres no telling what hes gonna do which is about the worst quality a ref can have
MMA,not_removed,big john took down tower seven
MMA,not_removed,thats just misdirection they want you to believe theres a rift between them so you dont suspect theyre in it together
MMA,not_removed,i hope that was a troll comment
MMA,not_removed,rockhold also verbally agreed with herb i believe or shook his head yes when asked if he wanted the stand up
MMA,not_removed,along with gary copeland
MMA,not_removed,most of the time i think herb does an ok job but in important fights with superstars he seems really to keep fan favorites in the fight other times he seems totally spaced out in both weidmanrockhold and silvabisping he waved off the fight in exact moment of the bell as if the losing fighter got saved by the bell
MMA,not_removed,he cant keep getting away with it
MMA,not_removed,can someone transcribesummarise on mobile
MMA,not_removed,is ufc unfiltered worth a listen they seem to get great guests and the hosts are funnyknowledgeable
MMA,not_removed,it all started when he broke both his arms
MMA,not_removed,basicaly he first fought at and beat an undefeated year old who had a lot of fights and the guy asked i wonder why im fighting this boy so the announcer called him wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,yeah its a good listen they get most of the big name guests and usually timely cause theyre obviously affiliated with the ufc i find serra a lot funnier than norton ironically
MMA,not_removed,dont forget to use the code onnit for off
MMA,not_removed,its a good listen i find everything matt serra does to be forced but i guess thats because hes new to it all
MMA,not_removed,and he started wondering
MMA,not_removed,the episode where serra was talking about being on the top list was hilarious
MMA,not_removed,you literally copied another post here dude
MMA,not_removed,dj making that case for best all time
MMA,not_removed,big difference i do think there is stiffer competition now making it way harder to defend belts times
MMA,not_removed,usada now that everyone is mostly off peds the only champs who will be dominant are in divisions where one person is ahead of everyone else skillwise
MMA,not_removed,it was from me
MMA,not_removed,cruz dc bisping and now woodley fox mma newscast is stacked with division champs right now waiting for karen bryant vs joanna next bring home that belt girl
MMA,not_removed,lol woodley is not hiding the fact that hes pissed that wonderboy overlooked him
MMA,not_removed,so how quickly can we get this wonderboy vs woodley fight made pls dont sit on the belt woodley
MMA,not_removed,fun fact that last four main events of the last four ufc cards have all ended in the first round ufc stipe kos werdum ufc bisping kos rockhold ufc nunes subs tate ufc woodley kos lawler
MMA,not_removed,motivational speakers hypnotherapists
MMA,not_removed,idk if this made it to broadcast but there was an incident with a group of fans during lawlers entrance idk exactly what they did but there was a huge commotion when robbie walked past them and like security guards came over and hopped into the stands and kicked their asses and threw em out of the stadium ellenberger was celebrating hard with the same dudes when he won hugging them and shit so im pretty sure they were his crew so there might be some mma beef goin on or something if anyone has more detail on what happened id love to know another weird part of this was every fighter the entire night came out the same corner of the arena robbie was the only one on the entire card to walk out of that corner of the stadium and the incident happened with the fans right on that corner of the stadium whole thing was weird as fuck awesome card though was my first mma event and i thought it was amazing hope they come back to atl
MMA,not_removed,dont bet against the fox sports analysts man woodley bisping dc cruz ufc tonight is the real winner lol
MMA,not_removed,if you are holding a belt youd better chain that fucker to your body because is gonna rip it away the first chance it gets youve been warned
MMA,not_removed,man conor really started a trend with this money fight thing now everyone is out there for that cash
MMA,not_removed,tyron woodley is one hell of a public speaker
MMA,not_removed,every time a champ gets dropped my appreciation for mighty mouse increases
MMA,not_removed,can we get lawler diaz now please
MMA,not_removed,everyone remember how this card was supposed to be a sleeper man you just dont know what you get any card can be golden or terrible and theres no sure way of knowing
MMA,not_removed,lawler vs diaz ii never made more sense
MMA,not_removed,did you think to not get knocked out fk that guy what a dumb question
MMA,not_removed,woodley literally just said he wants nick diaz for a money fight on ufc after wonderbody said he wants the title shot woodley then said go fight lawler since you said thats the fight you want im gonna get my money savage lmao now you can tell wonderboy is a little pissed saying that hed never be able to knock me out like that i move totally different than that that was a great segment lol
MMA,not_removed,first act as champion turn down a fight with the contender lol
MMA,not_removed,somehow all the underdogs are winning this year by then end of the year only conor is going to have his belt because he still wont have defended it
MMA,not_removed,lol people saying robbies chin is gone even though rory and condit are better technical fighters than tyron he is undoubtedly one of the hardest hitters not just at ww but probably in all of mma i dont think any fighter could take that lunchbox right hand clean just ask koscheck
MMA,not_removed,flash forward to wonderboy getting the belt and wanting big money fights instead of the contender who has never headlined a ppv
MMA,not_removed,the year of upset just keeps on going congrats to the chosen one damn robbie got rekt were on to the real ufc get hype boys
MMA,not_removed,lmao woodley shut wonderboy down with the i want nick diaz you fight robbie lawler since you said you wanted that fight i hope the ufc doesnt go that route tbh wonderboy deserves a title shot let nick have robbie lol
MMA,not_removed,if ellenbeger can catch wonderboy why cant woodley
MMA,not_removed,reddit analysts emerge and say that robbie has no chin anymore guess what guys when a pound trained martial artist hits you in the face you might just get knocked out they are still humans
MMA,not_removed,the ufc is regretting the money belt fights champs know the gig is up and with ppv points champs want that cash knowing belts dont mean shit when money is on the line alvarez is doing the same thing
MMA,not_removed,was never expecting matt brown or robbie lawler to be finished tonight woodley seems like a nice bloke im happy to see him as champion and theres no better way of doing it than in a first round ko of the current champ
MMA,not_removed,what about wonderboy wonderboy thought robbie was gonna win fuck wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,anyone remember that scene at the end of mortal kombat when all the souls were released
MMA,not_removed,fuck man hours later it still feels weird that robbie lost like that
MMA,not_removed,guys we could very well be seeing some of the last bald dudes yelling segments appreciate them accordingly
MMA,not_removed,still tyron doesnt get full respect some people already calling wonderboy the ww champ he just won the belt and knocked out the guy that some people were calling the ww of all time earlier today and already people are saying tyron cant win again
MMA,not_removed,i like that tyron is actually saying what he thinks whether i agree or not i think wonderboy should get the shot im not gonna hate tyron for trying to make some money while hes on top
MMA,not_removed,i picked woodley and i was rooting for him but wtf he knows wonderboy is high risk low reward and thats why he doesnt want to fight him i hope the ufc just makes him fight wonderboy they cant start going in the direction of boxing woodley was always talking about boxers in the leadup to the fight so we know where he gets it
MMA,not_removed,im actually happy rose lost tonight she was about to be fed to jj and wouldve taken a real life altering beating now she gets more time to grow and add some knew weapons to her arsenal
MMA,not_removed,tyron woodleys strikeforce debut was an untelevised preliminary fight on a card that was headlined by robbie lawler in oh how times have changed
MMA,not_removed,lol woodley saying he wants nick diaz next and thompson can fight lawler nah man i picked you to win but youre a fucking champ fight a contender fuck all that michael bisping nonsense
MMA,not_removed,people are pissed at woodley for saying all that but hes being honest better than the same old same old ill fight anyone they put in front of me hes trying to make money i dont hate that
MMA,not_removed,what would you guys rate after watching it
MMA,not_removed,at this rate by next year the champs will be sw karolina flw wilson reis bw bryan caraway fw jeremy stephens lw lando vannata ww jake ellenberger mw dan henderson lhw glover texiera hw tyson fury
MMA,not_removed,finding the hide chat button has made watching this on youtube so much easier
MMA,not_removed,robbie tearing that reporter apart lol
MMA,not_removed,sorry karolina joanna violence aint scared of anything
MMA,not_removed,a tiny observation on the fight when woodley dropped lawler i love how his first two ground and pound shots were right into the abdomen if robbie was able to defend himself on the ground prior to that he certainly wasnt able to after it just knocked all the air out of him and made him drop his hands before woodley then starting teeing off on his head great finish
MMA,not_removed,they should set up woodley vs wonderboy with nick diaz vs lawler ii as the comain event
MMA,not_removed,title defenses should be compared to winning nba championships in a rowthats dynasty level silva jones gsp mm and any other long reigning champions are your legendary teams i said this after and its helping me cope p
MMA,not_removed,as i said in the previous thread theres something about robbie losing in such way that fucks up my whole night
MMA,not_removed,damn champs have lost their belts in the first round this year and its only late july
MMA,not_removed,dude had the snapback ready lol
MMA,not_removed,tyrone be like fuck wonderboy you hear that wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,reporter asks about wonderboy getting the shot stephen thompson said he wanted to fight robbie lawler he said its a better matchup god fucking damn it he has a fucking point gsp wants to comeback on a post card wanted nothing to do with lawler but now has a better matchup in woodley bet money we get woodley vs gsp in msg
MMA,not_removed,lawler vs nick diaz please ufc
MMA,not_removed,i had that feeling that this might happen since the fight got near usually im shit and ofter im wrong but it happened tonight but seeing robbie get flatlined like that made my stomach turn i really hope robbies chin doesnt go the liddell route where every punch will ko him or drop him great card though
MMA,not_removed,id just like to point out that ellenberger has one smooth buttery voice
MMA,not_removed,who is woodleys manager got him a titleshot and now potentially a diaz fight
MMA,not_removed,whats next for rose
MMA,not_removed,it would not surprise me if wonderboy got passed up by nick diaz it seems the ufc is going towards the money fights recently
MMA,not_removed,most people here werent giving woodley a chance but watch rmma be full of woodley fans for the next month or so
MMA,not_removed,conor will be the only one to defend the belt this year by not defending it at all but can still keep it because he is conor
MMA,not_removed,i love dc dc making sure woodley gets the chance to give his family friends and team a thank you dc is such a lovable dude
MMA,not_removed,tyron being kinda lame on postfight saying he wants to fight nick diaz instead of wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,i cant believe we live in a world where woodley is champion i guess no one is invincible here anymore woodley v wonderboy lawler v diaz
MMA,not_removed,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
MMA,not_removed,so how much of that upset can we attribute to woodleys power vs robbies chin going i feel like a shot like that from woodley would sleep anybody but then again maybe i just really dont want to believe that lawlers chin is going
MMA,not_removed,i dont know what been tougher on musicians i love or ufc title holders
MMA,not_removed,so woodley vs wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy interviewing twood on is so awkward to me they were both professional but still weird
MMA,not_removed,i saw you thursday lol why did he say that so weird
MMA,not_removed,was really hoping for a round war but thems the breaks good job tyronebut nick diaz why is that the money fight
MMA,not_removed,well that happened tonight but my outlandish pick of wood let by tko was actually the only prediction that panned out this goddamn sport
MMA,not_removed,i want nick diaz to stockton slap this bitch
MMA,not_removed,how about make yourself a big money fighter rather than beg to fight other people who have made their own hype
MMA,not_removed,woodley already ducking wonderboy on the post fight show and asking to fight nick diaz on lol
MMA,not_removed,so what happens if woodley gets popped by usada for post tests will robbie get the belt back this is an honest question no hate intended
MMA,not_removed,diaz vs lawler wonderboy vs woodley then diaz vs wonderboy for the belt in
MMA,not_removed,its all fun and games until the youtube livestream keyboard warriors attack
MMA,not_removed,fights to make after ufc woodley vs wonderboy robbie vs conditmaia loser karolina vs joanna rose vs jessica aguilar ellenberger vs jorge masvidal matt brown vs patrick cote ross pearson vs takanori gomi
MMA,not_removed,damn woodley coming out straight and honest
MMA,not_removed,i was big on the lawler bandwagon about minutes ago but woodley dropped him dead can we not claim wonderboy will be champ in like months its disrespectful as hell i know its been a crazy but he won the title like minutes ago and people are calling him a ped popper and hell get beaten by wonderboy give the guy props he waited for his chance and took it as well as lawlers soul to be the champ you have to beat the champ lets wait until the fight is even announced before we tout wonderboy as ww champ
MMA,not_removed,i get that once you become champ you make that real money but can we stop with all the crazy super fight call outs he just called out a guy coming of a year suspension and a man whos been retired for years just bc he waited that long to fight doesnt mean everyone else has to wait that long to fight him especially with how log jammed he is responsible for making the welterweight division
MMA,not_removed,damn woodley came for blood and kod lawler kind of a crude way to put it but does anyone else feel that hendricks rory and condit loosened the jar and woodley came in to give the lid a sharp twist so he could open and eat the pickles i mean times rory beats woodley handily
MMA,not_removed,tyron just called out nick diaz
MMA,not_removed,good ppv
MMA,not_removed,lawlerdiaz rematch asap
MMA,not_removed,gotta look at how good gastelum is now he ate all that shit from woodley while lawler went down in minutes
MMA,not_removed,why robbie whhhyyyyy not like this
MMA,not_removed,i hope he doesnt get popped by usada it seems like thats been the theme the last few months
MMA,not_removed,total title defences current onlyamongst current champions mm has of them
MMA,not_removed,anyone have a gif of karolina before the fight as bruce was announcing her that wink before the fight i was swoond
MMA,not_removed,well now rory can finally win the title
MMA,not_removed,whats the spread on woodley failing his post fight test
MMA,not_removed,if ww matchmaking were like mw matchmaking then the next title fight would be woodley vs ellenberger
MMA,not_removed,the numbers diaz vs woodley would do and the ppv points would make woodley forget about all the time he took off money weight fight
MMA,not_removed,lawler is handling the l like a champ super articulate with his answers
MMA,not_removed,what the fuck is up with ellenbergers beard
MMA,not_removed,ufc has satisfied the void filled by grrm not finishing the winds of winter
MMA,not_removed,i get that he wants the money fights but a lawlerdiaz rematch would be a much bigger draw even though no belt would be on the line gsp isnt touching this either the ufc will probably rightfully make wonderboy woodley and lawler diaz ii at least i hope so because those are better fights
MMA,not_removed,damn tyron wants no part of wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,robbie took everything that condit and macdonald threw at him but the blacksposiveness was too much
MMA,not_removed,moral of the story dont be a champ defending a belt in seriously though i thought woodley was much flatter on his feet than lawler especially when robbie was moving in and out i felt there were a few openings for a high kick especially with robbies tdd and ground game he couldve just spun back ready for the takedown hell of a bomb by woodley though caught everyone by surprise
MMA,not_removed,i like woodley but i wouldve been way more stoked had it been macdonald or condit to dethrone robbie
MMA,not_removed,not even mad at woodley for wanting diaz for the get that while you can
MMA,not_removed,tyron just called out nick diaz for ufc i will watch the shit out of that
MMA,not_removed,maia and thompson both deserve the title shot more than nick diaz itll be just sad to see nick get it
MMA,not_removed,i dont like woodley as champ already
MMA,not_removed,not gonna lie the amount of hype he had generated had me kind of disliking lawler but hes handling the loss like an absolute champion real great show of character robbies got a new supporter
MMA,not_removed,reddit mma in full swing right now come get your salt
MMA,not_removed,tyron everyone but wonderboy please pretty please give me money moneyz for free please
MMA,not_removed,damn are you guys getting paid to fondle thompsons balls this hard or are yall doing it for free
MMA,not_removed,lawler vs diaz sounds like a good fight now
MMA,not_removed,champaggedon
MMA,not_removed,him calling out diaz makes sense he wants money im down for that but in this division fuck that wonderboy has to get it even maia deserves it more than diaz
MMA,not_removed,if tyron manages to beat wonderboy rory will probably become champion at least
MMA,not_removed,what a weird press conference
MMA,not_removed,lol did they give the retard the mic
MMA,not_removed,im basking in the woodley hate it feels so good to be so thoroughly vindicated
MMA,not_removed,i dont like bisping bullshitting hes a martial artist and not a prize fighter but going crazy about money fights like woodley is talking now is kinda putting me off i know thats how they make money but think still you need to keep the appearances
MMA,not_removed,i know tyron just koed one of the baddest fighters cold but ducking wonderboy after sitting out for months give me a break mannnn and fight a wrestler guess hendricks aint a wrestler lmao
MMA,not_removed,tyron give robbie back his soul
MMA,not_removed,he didnt even need to take a shower
MMA,not_removed,shoutout to all yall who bet on all the underdogs tonight
MMA,not_removed,who gets more pumped for their kid after a big win chris weidmans dad or woodleys mom
MMA,not_removed,do all the active fighter ufc tonight commentators have belts now cruz dc bisping and now woodley
MMA,not_removed,can we get lawlerdiaz ii now i also want to know what stephen thompson thinks anyone watching the post fight show let me know because im leaving the arena
MMA,not_removed,how is wonderboys tdd
MMA,not_removed,what a run atop the welterweight division for robbie lawler cant deny what hes done but woodley went in and just shut his lights out incredibly happy for ellenberger too sad for matt but so happy jake finally got the w he so desperately needed what a card tonight its always the lesser known cards that actually show up great night of fights great time to be an mma fan what a year its been
MMA,not_removed,so is round woodley a thing
MMA,not_removed,again wonderboy asking woodley the fight and tryon said to him to fight gastelumwrestler lol and he said i wanna get that money referring to nick
MMA,not_removed,it was unorthodox at time but it was a hell of a card good fights and wild finishes
MMA,not_removed,fuck yea
MMA,not_removed,preparation
MMA,not_removed,all favourites lost at ufc maincard this is a weird year in ufc so many title changes i cant believe that robbie lost like that after the wars with macdonald and conditt as well it is sad to see rose losing but i am happy for karolina and i hope we will have a polish title fight in poland i want to see next woodley vs thompson
MMA,not_removed,can we get a card in st louis now been unified rules in missouri for a few years now
MMA,not_removed,nick diaz vs woodley holy fuck
MMA,not_removed,money on tl against wonderboy tl to win
MMA,not_removed,robbie still bonechilling i see
MMA,not_removed,the notorious vs woodley s
MMA,not_removed,
MMA,not_removed,tyron telling wonderboy to go fight lawler is just beautiful to me
MMA,not_removed,dont see woodley beating wonderboy though
MMA,not_removed,so the running list of goats is sea level cain full camp mendes kod bisping and now round woodley
MMA,not_removed,i wont be sad if i never see dave sholler again after the sale is complete anyone know if he was originally dana or lorenzos guy was his rise from within the company or an outside hire
MMA,not_removed,does anybody in here understand what ducking is you cant duck in the ufc because theres only one promoter which isnt the case in boxing which allows it theres one promoter and one match maker so you fight who they say you fight woodley getting shitted on for answering a question honestly after having just walked through the former champ is bull shit
MMA,not_removed,tyron woodley can go fuck himself hes not fighting nick diaz next hes fighting thompson get over it
MMA,not_removed,can anyone direct me to a place where i can place a bet on woodley testing positive
MMA,not_removed,all the guys on desk now pretending like they knew it was going to happen like that fake ass mofos
MMA,not_removed,the way robbie fought to stand up after the ko reminds me of how stupid we used to be when it came to concussions someone would get knocked out and immediately it was get him on his feet sad for robbie but happy for tyron he earned that one
MMA,not_removed,i wonder if people will stop calling him tyrone now and remember its tyron worked for holly holmesholm
MMA,not_removed,first round woodley is a beast he could ko anyone
MMA,not_removed,good guy woodley
MMA,not_removed,why is nick diaz the money fight for woodley say over wonderboy is diazs name really that big a draw
MMA,not_removed,woodley is so fast but im still surprised lawlers left hand was down to protect him against woodleys right why is that
MMA,not_removed,really bummed out namajunas lost shes such a talented striker and grappler but she just kept going after that overhand right over and over again you can even see that karolina started to counter her with uppercuts and immediately getting her into clinch since karolina kept moving forward with her punches looking for that clinch wouldnt it be smarter for rose to distance fight keep the jab rolling Ã¡ la wonderboy she definately had some success with that catching karolina as she went in
MMA,not_removed,people seem especially salty about this upset woodley seems like a good dude too i dont get it
MMA,not_removed,dillashaw holm technically mcgregor werdum rockhold dos anjos tate and now lawler fucking wow
MMA,not_removed,found this comment on the ufc conference video that somes up what im thinking damn woodley is just full of hypocrisy and double standards not fought in months and whined about how he deserves the title shot and how title shots should be given by ranking and not drawing power wins the title and then doesnt want to give the most deserving fighter a shot but instead wants someone whos a big draw whined about mcgregor and how he should be stripped of his title now wants in on the mcgregor show at fuck this flip flopper
MMA,not_removed,win the belt then call out a guy that is on fight losing streak as your first title defense cmon woodley it would look terrible as hell for the ufc if they make that fight
MMA,not_removed,i just hope that guy put his bet on elleberger
MMA,not_removed,just as we all predicted
MMA,not_removed,you know a punch has power when it knocks robbie down like that
MMA,not_removed,i wonder what a bergerkkwoodley parlay wouldve paid out what a night
MMA,not_removed,lotta big knockouts on this one my god
MMA,not_removed,i didnt predict that
MMA,not_removed,how many more big upsets will we witness in the ufc
MMA,not_removed,a fantastic night of fights from beginning to end if anyone got onboard after ufc you got to see a fantastic show with no filler or dull matches pretty good way to spend a saturday
MMA,not_removed,great fight i hope wonderboy gets the first shot at the belt thatll be a good fight
MMA,not_removed,cant wait for the post fight press conference really want to see what tyron has to say
MMA,not_removed,i seriously need to start betting on these cards i feel like mma is the chosen sport for the underdog bet
MMA,not_removed,robbie vs nick
MMA,not_removed,almost as if goldberg jinxed it
MMA,not_removed,what belt changes have happened this year holm tate werdum stipe rockhold bisping rda alvarez tate nunes lawler woodley who am i missing
MMA,not_removed,future events can have womens strawweight and bantamweight mens bantamweight featherweight lightweight welterweight middleweight confirmed for and light heavyweight fights and since so many champs were dethroned a lot of former champs will be fighting too against top contenders its an exciting time to be a ufc fan with so many amazing fixtures coming up i am so excited for the next press conference with the champs and their challengers it will be ridiculous
MMA,not_removed,i wonder how lawlers chin is gonna be after all those wars and now that big shot
MMA,not_removed,i wasnt expecting a lot from this card but it was thoroughly enjoyable from top to bottom maybe even more so than i think its best to just never overhype a fight card nothing good can come from that
MMA,not_removed,aldo werdum rockhold dos anjos tate and now lawler all finished in round one since dec
MMA,not_removed,tyron on right now being pretty humble
MMA,not_removed,are there going to be any more fights shown or are they just going to chat about it now
MMA,not_removed,woodley came in like a lightning bolt
MMA,not_removed,man rough night for some fanfavoriteslawler namajunas and brown being decisively beaten
MMA,not_removed,karolina has sunglasses on
MMA,not_removed,just like that yea lol
MMA,not_removed,why did they usher all the fighters out when woodley walked into the press conference
MMA,not_removed,whats next for matt brown rough fight for him i thought he had this one
MMA,not_removed,usada please hes a black boy and hes jacked deal with it like actually deal with it and test him more often
MMA,not_removed,im sorry but this is pathetic by woodley a guy who sat out for nearly years to wait for his shit wether oh cool hes so honest or not pretty poor
MMA,not_removed,omg this voice of the black guy is so about to have sex
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy is the money fight because im willing to pay money to watch him chew that ass up but watching him eat a tbomb would be acceptable entertainment too
MMA,not_removed,lol the woodley hate
MMA,not_removed,i was the first to shit on woodley proved me wrong
MMA,not_removed,i called it i knew t wood was too explosive
MMA,not_removed,woodley knocked the chin right off of lawler
MMA,not_removed,my bets on the fights tonight
MMA,not_removed,who has the potential to be a dominant champion
MMA,not_removed,best card ive ever seen imo
MMA,not_removed,tyron said he wants to fight nick diaz just told wonderboy to go fight robbie
MMA,not_removed,everyone either thinks woodley will pop right after this or wonderboy will walk through him i dont think ive ever seen so few people respect a new champion everyone loved bisping and stipe respected nunes and alvarez but now woodley is the ww champ and he still isnt legit
MMA,not_removed,all the woodly haters quiet af right now
MMA,not_removed,are people forgetting wonderboy about an hour ago said hed rather fight lawler because hes the champ if wonderboy wants to fight lawler then let him woodley can fight diaz
MMA,not_removed,ayyyy wheres all my lawler truthers at
MMA,not_removed,usada is keeping the fighters in check
MMA,not_removed,at least hes honest i guess
MMA,not_removed,anyone think theyre not going to give karolina the title shot yet i feel you have to make that fight in poland and theres no ufcs in poland this year meanwhile jojo vs andrade are fighting at theyre contenders too and jojo vs jj would be huge in manchester joanna also really wants to be on the msg card but is jj vs kk a big enough fight for that
MMA,not_removed,anyone else worried that woodley wont defend the belt this year
MMA,not_removed,you want joanna to get locked up for murder
MMA,not_removed,he said he wanted the fight with robbie because their fight would be more entertaining and now hell have the opportunity to do that cold as fuck
MMA,not_removed,im with you man hope he doesnt sit around too long
MMA,not_removed,nunes basically kos tate
MMA,not_removed,i personally think it was the katy perry walkout music
MMA,not_removed,anybody got footage
MMA,not_removed,i saw that too but i just assumed it was a fight between fans
MMA,not_removed,ive been to a few live events before and its pretty common for the main event headliner to walk in from the opposite side of the arena not sure why though
MMA,not_removed,you know who was the analyst tonight right wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,gotta setup olivi vs jj
MMA,not_removed,can you blame them the shelf life of a fighter isnt like jaromir jagr these days
MMA,not_removed,maybe if ufc would actually pay their fighters a decent amount
MMA,not_removed,its the analyst affect all the fighters that are fox commentators either already are or become hella better at interviewing after the fact
MMA,not_removed,super eloquent and easy on the ears
MMA,not_removed,mm is one of the greatest to ever fight imo but the division doesnt compare to etc in terms of talent
MMA,not_removed,tbf has no where near the danger that welterweight has
MMA,not_removed,and joanna
MMA,not_removed,yea also for gsp anderson silva fedor and jj crazy what a volatile environment the ufc is now vs when those guys just held the belt forever
MMA,not_removed,i dont know about that maybe theyre saving it for ufc
MMA,not_removed,ive been waiting for the rematch since that finish left me devastated
MMA,not_removed,it actually has made plenty more sense at other times considering diaz hasnt won a fight in half a decade
MMA,not_removed,did you think about keeping your hands up lol wtf is that shit what a fucking goof
MMA,not_removed,woodleys burn was hilarious could tell it rattled wonderboy people over reacting already to this ducking crap
MMA,not_removed,didnt nick say before he would never fight on the same card as his brother or something over them lines it would be amazing to see them fight on the same card aswell
MMA,not_removed,i dont respect that hope wonderboy gets the fight and takes him out
MMA,not_removed,and he said he has to fight robbie to get a title shot pretty dumb
MMA,not_removed,what a champion
MMA,not_removed,and this is why nobody wanted woodley to win the guy wants the belt but doesnt want to fight the top fighters that are active right now
MMA,not_removed,remember what rory did to woodley wonderboy does that again hes running from that fight
MMA,not_removed,i think we just have to accept that when a fighter loses theres going to be a large majority of people claiming suspect chin or post usada even though they have no idea what theyre talking about
MMA,not_removed,tyron was just a horrible match up for robbie robbie has been through wars and then he gets matched with an explosive hard puncher like tyron robbie also tends to gain momentum as the rounds go on whereas tyron tends to be at his best during the first rounds before fading it also doesnt help that robbie is super hittable
MMA,not_removed,is it really such a ridiculous sentiment to think that after all of the damage lawler has accumulated over the past two years that his chin might not have much left
MMA,not_removed,no champ is safe maybe reis wouldve beaten dj tonight if that fight happened this year is fucking insane that was the seventh time a belt has changed hands in
MMA,not_removed,wait what he said that dudes picking the easy fight
MMA,not_removed,shut him down more like lost more fans by ducking that fight
MMA,not_removed,which is bullshit regardless of what he said previously thompson has made it clear he feels hes next for a title shot and not many would disagree much respect for tyron with taking the belt but now youre up to face the number one contender dont call out a guy whos been out for months and has lost the majority of his last fights nc so basically time to put your money where your mouth is tyron and fight stephen
MMA,not_removed,its a matter of probabilities this is mma anyone in the ufc can beat anyone in their weight division given the right moment but stephen thompson is just a better fighter than woodley most would say
MMA,not_removed,cause woodley only has one move
MMA,not_removed,are you
MMA,not_removed,considering how many fights that have been pulled i dont blame him
MMA,not_removed,ducking wonderboy already
MMA,not_removed,didnt want money for those months he sat out apparently already a bad taste in my mouth with our new ww champ really would have been exciting if he said lets book the wonderboy fight asap dude fought for one fucking minute lets get this going
MMA,not_removed,when conor made ten million last year for not defending his belt you cant blame them
MMA,not_removed,whatever gets the most views for the ufc doubt they care too much about the sanctity of the ufc ranking
MMA,not_removed,woodley wont get diaz he doesnt have the clout mcgregor did
MMA,not_removed,god i expected robbie to lose before i expected matt to lose in the first round to jake that kick was absolutely brutal the knockdown i feel like he recovers well from and was even hurting jake a bit up until jake nailed him with that insane kick what a great main event
MMA,not_removed,i kinda like that attitude
MMA,not_removed,i hear yea but wb earned his shot fair and square without a hype train i mean how many fighters does he have to dismantle to get the shot he destroyed all of the bad matchups the ufc threw at him you gotta give him the shot soon or he might quit and dominate bellator for a while lol
MMA,not_removed,not to mention his gym basically all sided with robbie and had tyron counted out that has to feel sweet for tyron now
MMA,not_removed,his record sucks he doesnt fight often and that was quite a favourable matchup for him hes lost to rory could lose again will highly likely lose to wonderboy maia is there too hes not on a streak like wonderboy is hes already lost to top contenders are you surprised people think he wont last long
MMA,not_removed,people on this sub barely ever give people the full respect they deserve everybody was sleeping on woodley and ellenberger also two guys with insane power who can put anyone out given the right night people never learn despite all of the upsets that have happened there are very few fights in the ufc between top guys where one guy wins of the time im happy i got my fantasy points though wish i was able to bet somehow though httpimgurcomatwcto
MMA,not_removed,he never beat a diaz
MMA,not_removed,i think that he and people fail to realize that he has little to no leverage the ufc is the promoter they do not have to give him the fights he wants or on the cards he wants if he refuses fights then they can strip him of his title
MMA,not_removed,i also think that hes a little butthurt that wonderboy said that he thought robbie would win and wanted that fight
MMA,not_removed,where did he say it
MMA,not_removed,its your time to hype a fight and make money doing it ill fight anyone yadda yadda thats not promoting yourself effectively thats not hyping your next fight call a mother fucker out who will make headlines and money
MMA,not_removed,yep and if he does fight diaz and holds off the wonderboy fight it will most likely become a bigger fight due to the whole ducking story line they can weave in smart move twood people are now really invested in that match up and when theyre invested that means
MMA,not_removed,few snoozers but pretty good wish mighty mouse would have been able to fight on it
MMA,not_removed,nah amir khan will be the fw champ p
MMA,not_removed,if henderson will become the champ ill be so pissed with ufc bisping vs henderson is plain dumb
MMA,not_removed,reading it offends my eyes
MMA,not_removed,its a shame how only thing people can talk about how hes such a bitch for going after the money fights that was a real nice performance against a beast
MMA,not_removed,lawler is a friend and im a big fan but that was a veteranmove by woodley thanks for mentioning it like lawler said woodley took advantage of an opportunity and capitalized on it well
MMA,not_removed,idk man i see where youre coming from but the way mma is you could win a fight off of pure luck or even a fluke playing around games each lasting minutes leaves a lot less room for luck
MMA,not_removed,agreed id also throw aldo and fedor up there
MMA,not_removed,i doubt well see long reigning champs anymore every fighter has weaknesses
MMA,not_removed,like seeing your dad get knocked out
MMA,not_removed,robbie rory inc
MMA,not_removed,if brown had won and lawler lost i was kind of hoping for robbiebrown
MMA,not_removed,cte should be a big scare for fighters the more we learn about concussions and brain trauma the more the risk should outweigh the reward
MMA,not_removed,if he keeps being in wars it might end up being like that hopefully he spares us from seeing him end up like liddell
MMA,not_removed,training to defend against knees in the clinch i hope
MMA,not_removed,invicta
MMA,not_removed,i think nick diaz vs robbie lawler in a contender match on the same card as wonderboy vs woodley is the real money match
MMA,not_removed,you kidding me woodley ducked hector lombard had a year and a half to reinvent himself now he wont fight thompson after lawler wanted more time off but took the woodley fight anyway
MMA,not_removed,and when he loses the opinion of i knew he was overrated coming out
MMA,not_removed,literally of this sub said dae think tyron knocks him out
MMA,not_removed,i think youre forgetting about the olympic wrestler getting smashed by mighty mouse back in april
MMA,not_removed,remindme months
MMA,not_removed,in weeks tho
MMA,not_removed,he snubbed wonderboy for overlooking him and called out the bigger money fight that was brilliant imo he fact that hes triggering so many people is an added bonus
MMA,not_removed,smart move on his part though look at what happened to holly holm didnt get the ronda rematch and missed her chance to cash in a fighters window is too short and these guys are way underpaid i say cash in asap and take the diaz fight
MMA,not_removed,correction woodley and bisping ðð
MMA,not_removed,same world where the champ is going to fight two matches in a row for no title reasons ufc has been an absolute shitfight this year but fuck i love it
MMA,not_removed,im pretty sure it was just because of woodleys power huge blacksplosive nuclear bomb that landed clean cya consciousness
MMA,not_removed,dude i felt the wind from that punch watching at home i dont know if any welterweight would be able to eat that and stay standing im also pretty stupid so i could very well be wrong
MMA,not_removed,its probably both either way woodleys punch didnt do lawlers chin any favors
MMA,not_removed,woodley just said he wants nick diaz and money fights said wonderboy should scrap it out with gastelum etc before his title shot bullshit from a guy that just sat out months
MMA,not_removed,because youll pay to see it
MMA,not_removed,because that fight hypes itself
MMA,not_removed,i had a dream that woodley would get the knockout in either the or round last night i should have bet on him
MMA,not_removed,is less then a month away would wonderboy be ready for that nick diaz gives no fucks if he can get a title shot hell take no matter how shot his camp might be
MMA,not_removed,the title would be vacated i think
MMA,not_removed,pretty sure it gets vacated
MMA,not_removed,really good question would be a messy situation for sure
MMA,not_removed,thats awesome something that doesnt really make sense atm but i would love to see cerrone vs wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,wow i didnt even think about how this sets up a perfect rematch sry for caps but bru u gotta be excited
MMA,not_removed,i prefer robbie vs nick diaz
MMA,not_removed,i dont think you make a fight for ross based on this event i think you just ignore this fight considering it was outside his division on short notice weeks after losing a tough decision
MMA,not_removed,just let gomi retire in peace also wheres cowboy
MMA,not_removed,oh man please let condit beat maia now would love to see lawler condit again after that close fight last time
MMA,not_removed,woodley summed up his reasons perfectly diaz is a bigger name than condit or wonderboy the dude is looking for the most profitable fight out there and who else would make more money remember the ufc has been pretty clear that the more popular fighter will almost always get the title shot ahead of the most qualified contender because the ufc is in the selling ppvs business not the whats fair business hell the only way i see he diaz fight not happening is if gsp comes back though i believe gsp would come back at if he does return
MMA,not_removed,woodley was opening any jar with that right hand didnt matter if it was loosened or factory sealed that was a bomb
MMA,not_removed,condit called it lawlers chin has been in too many wars
MMA,not_removed,metaphor
MMA,not_removed,that right would have kod an elephant
MMA,not_removed,whats up with the new champs calling out dudes that are way down the rankings bisping calling out hendo now woodley calling out nick hendo is currently listed as on ufcs site but nick isnt even ranked
MMA,not_removed,hell have to make weight
MMA,not_removed,i said this in mms discord and got a bit of heat for it with regards to woodley saying he wanted nick diaz next instead of wonderboy i dont think this is a ducking scenario at all i think woodley knows nick diaz draws bigger s and this is a chance for him to make some real money now that he has the belt
MMA,not_removed,hardest hitter in division
MMA,not_removed,you think woodley will stand and bang with him or just wrestle
MMA,not_removed,i agree but imagine if nate beats connor and nate and nick fight on the same card for two diffrent belts dos anjos and twood
MMA,not_removed,robbie is the man bro thats why this sub almost universally loved him he loves to bang
MMA,not_removed,post event reactions are a given ive been guilty of it myself
MMA,not_removed,the entire top of the welterweight division has a solid chance of beating woodley and everyone wants to see if the champ can back up his own hype hes talked so much about wanting to prove that hes the best in the world but he hasnt beat anyone in the top five for two years until he got his title shot thompson is an excellent striker that can keep him at range rory dominated woodley maia could probably get inside and outgrapple him lawler could come back for a rematch with a great game plan and it would be interesting to see a real fight with condit and not a fluke where his knee blows out even past the top five magny and a healthy gastelum could be interesting matchups honestly as much as i enjoy the diaz bros hype fuck this noise about diaz vs woodley give it to a real contender and let diaz prove himself elsewhere
MMA,not_removed,i cant recall seeing this much salt since back in the day when rashad evans won the lhw title its like everyone who was rooting for lawler jumped straight on the wonderboy bandwagon
MMA,not_removed,maias current run puts him in the picture too i think
MMA,not_removed,they gave him the drunk mic
MMA,not_removed,i love it
MMA,not_removed,i can understand your view totally however whenever you have sons i think thats what i heard shit i dont give a fuck who id i would fight once nick diaz to have them set up for college
MMA,not_removed,id say hes going after the money rather than ducking someone whos fights got pulled might be looking for a payday or two
MMA,not_removed,woodleys was at home only barber shops are cursed
MMA,not_removed,so crazy man i honestly think it has at least a little bit to do with their intelligence you have to have smarts to talk on the mic and analyze the sport like they do and they bring that knowledge into the octagon
MMA,not_removed,was really good against hendricks but would woodley even try to take him down
MMA,not_removed,its always been a thing
MMA,not_removed,very good card i think wed kick a puppy for cards this good everytime
MMA,not_removed,whos tl
MMA,not_removed,im a mean individual yipes
MMA,not_removed,obviously notorious would karate chop his head offduh
MMA,not_removed,but what about all those commercials with dana and connor claiming that connor will fight anyone at any weight
MMA,not_removed,i didnt see the press conference yet so i dont know the context in which this was said but is that not blatant ducking
MMA,not_removed,why come you hate dave
MMA,not_removed,its the ufcs fault hendo is getting a title shot while true contenders dont woodley wants to cash in like the ufc is cashing in hell woodley stopped condit and the the ufc let condit challenge first the ufc could have a history of only legit challengers but they dont
MMA,not_removed,if nick diaz traingled woodley to become the ww champion i might just quit watching mma for nothing could top that
MMA,not_removed,i hate that he expects his opponents to make the money for him if he wants money he needs to sell that shit or become a dominate champ that people come out to see destroy folks its a sport you fight the best wonderboy is the most deserving right now and if you cant sell that fight you couldnt sell water to people in hell
MMA,not_removed,im not at a tv right now but are dc and florian there because the both of them actually called woodley to win
MMA,not_removed,didnt work for rhondai mean ronda
MMA,not_removed,dont forget connoror worse conner
MMA,not_removed,lol i finally noticed tonight too so i think so
MMA,not_removed,being knocked out may appear worse but believe me playing football games and slamming into people over and over is much more dangerous
MMA,not_removed,nick diaz and gsp drew almost million buys nick himself has been a mainstay in the ufc exlitexc and strikeforce for years
MMA,not_removed,because woodley thinks its a good match up for him the longer he retains the belt the more money he makes hes basically ducking wonderboy
MMA,not_removed,woodley threw a couple of feints before throwing the right
MMA,not_removed,a lot of times when the combo comes the defender leansmoves back diminishing the attackers reach to the head hence a bodyshot is often more of a concern for the defender as he leansmoves backward however woodley was already committed to coming forward and did a small crophop with his feet while moving into the overhand right this closed the distance quickly and increased woodleys punchingpower and a reach coming from a guy is deceiving lawyers lefthand was down likely in anticipation of a bodyshot followup to the combo could have happened to anyone really lawyer should get a rematch
MMA,not_removed,because robbie was the moat exciting champion and beloved tyron just seems like a step down cause hes nowhere near as interesting
MMA,not_removed,if anything that makes more sense woodley said it himself during the presser you guys already know how the rankings are generated it seems like with all the hate and anger thrown at him for waiting for what he got promised made him realized the word deserve is not in the ufcs vocabulary and hes running with it
MMA,not_removed,now it will be a year of lawlers chin is gone
MMA,not_removed,wasnt that great of a bet this time woodley was like a underdog edit i wanted to bet on him but it wasnt worth it why am i adding this in an edit when my first sentence basicalyl said it fuck it
MMA,not_removed,dont think nick wants to take any more robbie lawler punches to the head
MMA,not_removed,dillashaw cruz edit jan because of downvotes
MMA,not_removed,cruz dillashaw
MMA,not_removed,no more fights tonight i wouldnt be able to handle more heartbreak anyway
MMA,not_removed,he came in like a wrecking ball
MMA,not_removed,cowboy if he beats story
MMA,not_removed,he was tested times this year the salt is real
MMA,not_removed,he wouldnt have been waiting for two years if hendricks would have made the weight cut so i feel your comment to a degree is unfair
MMA,not_removed,whats pathetic
MMA,not_removed,dana white promised tyrone woodley that he would get a shot at the welterweight title since johny hendricks missed his weight cut
MMA,not_removed,id say his fights got pulled rather than sat out
MMA,not_removed,chew that ass up dont say it like that
MMA,not_removed,pls share ur picks next time so i can do the opposite
MMA,not_removed,brown looked like a sure thing
MMA,not_removed,jj
MMA,not_removed,cruz
MMA,not_removed,cormier if jones gets years
MMA,not_removed,joanna dj cruz and dc i think the only one i can even imagine losing is cruz in a dillashaw rematch
MMA,not_removed,i dont believe thats a reality in current day mma
MMA,not_removed,rousey could do it again id say jj and mighty mouse are already dominant champs too
MMA,not_removed,dj and jj are already about as dominant as a champ gets in modern mma
MMA,not_removed,wonderboy mm cruz
MMA,not_removed,was pretty good did you see
MMA,not_removed,which is bullshit from a competition standpoint
MMA,not_removed,people like bisping but all but his most diehard fans feel he got lucky and wont be champ long
MMA,not_removed,barao didnt either then he got beat by tj so people felt vindicated said he was overrated to begin with
MMA,not_removed,people are just salty that woodley took robbie into the shadow realm im sure rampage got the same treatment when he starched chuck
MMA,not_removed,everyone loved bisping what damn near everyone ive seen is saying bisping is gonna lose the belt hella quick
MMA,not_removed,dude nobody thinks bisping is going to hold that title the henderson fight is a gift
MMA,not_removed,twisting his words maybe
