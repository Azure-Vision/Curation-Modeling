OldSchoolCool,removed,i heard that audio of trump he states that he grabs them by the pussy and that they let you do it he literally states they give him consent yes he has probably stated his daughter is attractive because she is im not a fan of incest but i can admit that some of my relatives would are definitely considered attractive from the perspective of an outsider to my family the latter point you make is just an accusation probably revenge from a dumb broad that couldnt get hired no evidence of the latter either heres more footage of creepy uncle biden

OldSchoolCool,removed,the day of september i was home alone watching shrek i heard a ring at the doorbell and walked over looking out the door i saw a car driving away and a small package sitting on the doorstep curious i brought it inside and unwrapped it it was a case with jacob slendtorius written on it in comic sans confused i scratched my head and pulled out the case i opened it up and inside was a cd i placed the cd in my cd player and white noise played i heard scratching at my window and as i approached the noise on the cd got louder and so did the scratching my heart was racing faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the cd i listened closer it was jacob sartoriuss distorted mixtape the sound of autotune echoed in the background suddenly from my window i saw a beanied gnomelike figure the stench of popcorn singeing my nose behind him was a tall dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces the mixtape the gnome figure the scratching i knew it could be only one thing it was jacob slendtorius i thought he was just an urban legend but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me what is up dramalertnation lets get roiiiight into the news the gnome whispered i screamed and my ears began to bleed the taller figure the one i had now recognized to be jacob slendtorius slowly walked forward frantically i pulled up the youtube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed the slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly now only feet away in a raspy prepubescent autotuned voice with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin he told me that i could wear his sweatshirt i dont want to please leave me alone i replied his grin dropped and his face went blank he came closer making me increasingly uncomfortable he warned me that if i do not post this on reddit i will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life and he will make me wear his sweatshirt the slendtorius left seven lyric pages and selfadvertisements and promotions on the ground and forced me to hide them in the forest he vanished into the night along with his smaller gnome figure i took the godforsaken cd and attempted to break it but it wouldnt crack hammered it scratched it threw it sat on it digested it but it wouldnt break i put it in the cd player once more and it was a message from the slendtorius you must share this cd give it to an unsuspecting person and do not mention me you will otherwise be forever cursed just like this cd i put it in the mail to a random address and my life has been normal ever since i had my phone on me at the time and was able to take a few pictures for proof i took pictures of the cd case the silhouette of the slendtorius at my window and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted these are those images

OldSchoolCool,removed,white guilt overload those evil white people how dare they enjoy a park their taxes paid for and other white people built i have seen parks in black neighborhoods not any place id like to take my kids perhaps their longing comes from the fact all the parks in the hood are nasty disgusting places
OldSchoolCool,removed,more like blacks dont give a fuck about infrastructure that was created for them by whites see south africa
OldSchoolCool,removed,south africa is the perfect example why multiculturalism doesnt work you can give them everything but you will never win unfortunately this is how life works the best
OldSchoolCool,removed,those were the days
OldSchoolCool,removed,do you think anyone in that park is getting beat up or anyone robbing them of their phones erradios or headphones or shoes think anyone is smoking crack or selling ass in there
OldSchoolCool,removed,if it were up to only blacks there wouldnt be a fence or playground so lets make it great for the people who want to build greatness
OldSchoolCool,removed,until the slogan subsaharan africa was never great takes off and logic takes over it will always be on whitey bringing a brother down
OldSchoolCool,removed,economically i think it was
OldSchoolCool,removed,we wuz kangz
OldSchoolCool,removed,economy gdp home ownership jobs entrepreneurship not crying for handouts and wanting to make it on your own good enough
OldSchoolCool,removed,and they say kids these days show too much skin i get that its probably really hot out but i would not have let my black kids wander around like that in a neighborhood that has laws segregating them from normal kids also this pic is a bummer and misses the point of the sub in an effort to collect white guilt points
OldSchoolCool,removed,because cant dos crying that white people made a playground for themselves and didnt share is bs everyone is painting a narrative in this thread about evil whitey and not looking at didnt build park darkey why not just ask them for their wives homes food and jobs oh you are trying
OldSchoolCool,removed,no getting beat up by a black kid whos dad ran off is just part of equality now remember when america was not as great
OldSchoolCool,removed,more like old school crying for handouts
OldSchoolCool,removed,go cry yourself to sleep
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont try to sweep it under the rug and it is a root for the west problems trying to support a race who hates themselves and sees success as a threat
OldSchoolCool,removed,those kids cant wait to tag all over the playground
OldSchoolCool,removed,more like economy even thought i am fully support the black only safe spaces that blm wanted just as long as whites get theres too
OldSchoolCool,removed,no its people of color so you can try to side all brown minorities against evil whitey didnt you get the memo
OldSchoolCool,removed,i straight jam and draino on your ass fgt
OldSchoolCool,removed,the only reason it looks so inviting is because they werent allowed in
OldSchoolCool,removed,too bad their people dont care enough to build them playgrounds damn whitey quit building cool shit and making us look bad fuck you whitey nah wait whitey can i just ride the ferris wheel a few times and thanks for all the computers and shit
OldSchoolCool,removed,blacklivesmatter black only safe spaces didnt know they said sad
OldSchoolCool,removed,hey fuck you whitey
OldSchoolCool,removed,its called a safe space and i am all for them learned from black lives matter
OldSchoolCool,removed,after world war ii until around jfk assassination
OldSchoolCool,removed,gotta maga by blaming the people for their problems and their runaway fathers
OldSchoolCool,removed,when was planet earth great you act like there arnt people who choose to be losers and not work there are fucked up people in the world that arnt worth anyones time
OldSchoolCool,removed,thats not what people who have issues with welfare complain about they complain about people having kid after kid to get increases on welfare they complain that a single mother gets more than a married woman they complain that families gongenerations on welfare and blame everyone else in the world for their situation have you ever actually spoken to someone who knows about welfare or do you just make shit up
OldSchoolCool,removed,plenty of booksstudies have proven that women were happier at home and raising children the domestic housewife being bad is sad myth that has destroyed the family
OldSchoolCool,removed,no they didnt they just moved away from the old places they use to live who wants to own a house that goes down in value each year you have it who wants to send their child to a school that has so many failing students that they say the good ones have nothing to worry about who wants to live in an area that is plagued by gang culture its called white flight
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah the things that make a country and its inhabitants have more money
OldSchoolCool,removed,not the one catering to blm good guess crybabies please keep fighting for your black only safe space cant wait to make some for my tribe and not have to listen to your bitchfits
OldSchoolCool,removed,the ones that gene down with another race sure arent you are correct
OldSchoolCool,removed,gotta maga by using life experience and facts to come to this conclusion
OldSchoolCool,removed,as if i was somehow implying these children i expressed pity and concern for were not also normal kids you should get the sjw assplug out before you die of sepsis
OldSchoolCool,removed,i see
OldSchoolCool,removed,corrupt politicians and welfare reform are two completely superset issues no one was talking about corrupt politicians in this thread there is no reason to think i support that if you think people are upset widows are offered welfare you are a fool again its not that some family is getting a few hundred dollars its that the more poor decisions you make the more money the states offer you it should reward people who improve themselves rather than those that dont grow up
OldSchoolCool,removed,old pappys law
OldSchoolCool,removed,stop being jealous over what other people have
OldSchoolCool,removed,until i can put a no coloreds on the front of my business you are wrong
OldSchoolCool,removed,im not talking about the individuals who accept welfare im talking about how the system choose who to support and who not to the incentives are in place to encourage poor decision making
OldSchoolCool,removed,httpwwwtradingeconomicscomunitedstatesgdpgrowth click max for years am i missing something it looks like won
OldSchoolCool,removed,i can play this game too after letting blacks into the playground
OldSchoolCool,removed,go curse out the people who took the studies
OldSchoolCool,removed,black people dont have a leg to stand on because they had a million year head start on the human thing and their homelands are the bottom of the barrel so when they come to the west and cry whitey did dis to us there is no evidence that you are being oppressed because you do shit in you native lands
OldSchoolCool,removed,if you cant disconnect american nationalism and american success from your race then you dont believe whitey has changed at all and because of that there is no reason for whitey to change so fuck you your kids and your kind you wanna be oppressed and try to lock out american success because you cant cut it you and your crybaby message can go to the back of the bus and stay
OldSchoolCool,removed,httpwwwedinformaticscominventionsinventors not catering do no dos that is for sure give me money white man stop innovatin the future
OldSchoolCool,removed,you resist the white guilt spell
OldSchoolCool,removed,or we could just put up some trade policies that could mimic the success and stop outsourcing everything so the trash immigrants that should be here in the first place can buy the crap that we should have been making for ourselves and the right price
OldSchoolCool,removed,im not racist please black man brown man etc please go be superior africa india shoot for the moon even though whitey beat you there
OldSchoolCool,removed,women arnt happy in general a women is happiest pregnant and paid for
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah because africa is a shining beacon of progression and innovation but when black man goes anywhere else its the natives fault day been oppressed prove it with greatness black folk innovate some shit entrepreneur it

OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,i just want what black lives matter wants a safe space
OldSchoolCool,removed,cute kids healthy stylish with heads full of hair integration didnt have to happen all blacks wanted was equal access for their taxes but it escorted the decimation of the black industry and communities health and well being the populace is still as racist blacks are just weaker than past generations white people eat kale now
OldSchoolCool,removed,no one said they dont have a choice they can do heroin to feel good for all i care
OldSchoolCool,removed,hah dont worry i am many different people
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont do crossposting essay reddit battles sorry
OldSchoolCool,removed,great now start using toilets indians
OldSchoolCool,removed,the title is misleading the children could easily climb the fence
OldSchoolCool,removed,i have a strange churn in my stomach after seeing this im neither black or white just the thought makes me sick
OldSchoolCool,removed,well when black culture starts taking credit for its own faults and not blamin da white man i will believe the future is present
OldSchoolCool,removed,imagine a world where america never had slaves then there probably wouldnt be that many black people around only the ones we need and discard after the occasional mandingo fight it is almost to nice a thought to think
OldSchoolCool,removed,nothing like a daily dose of reddit white guilt im wondering when the dopamine rush of making yourself feel good for internet points will wear off
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah its fires
OldSchoolCool,removed,the good old days
OldSchoolCool,removed,get your hands off that whitesonly fence
OldSchoolCool,removed,make america great again
OldSchoolCool,removed,i see a group of black kids in respectable clothing because they are trying to prove to whites they can take care of themselves and their appearance now that we have equality they dont give a fuck and look like shit racist whites bring out the best in blacks so maybe we need to become racist again
OldSchoolCool,removed,theyre clean and wearing styles of the day with wellstyled and barbered hair why do you see poor this is what racism is associating negative attributes with specific ethnic groups
OldSchoolCool,removed,thats great man hoping for that future too of black kids are raised in fatherless homes instead of blaming that they blame da ebil white man i could care less what race you are but you want to try to paint whitey into a corner for all your problems ill be vicious and call out all the bullshit
OldSchoolCool,removed,so to be white is dislike sharing
OldSchoolCool,removed,magathis is the america that people voted for s
OldSchoolCool,removed,itt im an uppermiddle class white person and i apologize cuz it mustve been haard for you im an ally
OldSchoolCool,removed,if they knew how the black community was going to end up it never would have changed
OldSchoolCool,removed,sure if you bring housing costs and all food and merchandise back to it too
OldSchoolCool,removed,this neighborhood is a shit hole now integration was a mistake
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah and slavery was invented by africa slavery is old as time ottoman empire took millions of europeans as slaves you dont see us sitting on our ass and wanting to be oppressed
OldSchoolCool,removed,nowadays its the other way around white genocide
OldSchoolCool,removed,wow clean well cared for equipment no drug deals no broken beer bottles no needles a ferris wheel how wonderful for the kids but when lower classes destroy and damage out of loathing and resentment and lack of input in society all must be pared down to basics sad
OldSchoolCool,removed,makes you yearn for the good ol days when white was right
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,now the park is filled with drugs and murder victims hmmmmm
OldSchoolCool,removed,make america great again
OldSchoolCool,removed,there are only a few of me that needs that the others fit just perfect in our society
OldSchoolCool,removed,they went and built their own playground with hookers and beer
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah stop begging for free shit get up off your ass and work
OldSchoolCool,removed,ah the good ole days
OldSchoolCool,removed,more like they didnt have equal perseverance and still dont no one was stopping blacks from building a ferris wheel in their hood and still arnt
OldSchoolCool,removed,what is the proximity to the ground up trash that is taking over us cities and asking for whitey to support them
OldSchoolCool,removed,the good old days
OldSchoolCool,removed,why do women chase famous people why do women like rich guys stop living in your fairytale disney narrative even disney hoes were chasing prince dick
OldSchoolCool,removed,the good old days
OldSchoolCool,removed,more like white created this shit go make your own damn sandwich
OldSchoolCool,removed,also you are forgetting that in africa there was no thing as safe swimming water but you would have to believe in genetics can make people better at certain things
OldSchoolCool,removed,httpwwwedinformaticscominventionsinventors million year head start still cant keep up
OldSchoolCool,removed,you reward the improving yes having children can be a poor choice having children you cant support is a poor decision the standards are set by society if you are making healthy choices working hard and staying out of trouble the government should help you out its not easy for everyone but the poor every single person who didnt marry a wealthy person climbed out of poverty in an era that had no welfare to speak of its not impossible you cant expect it to just happen over night its a life time of making better decisions anyway the government can assist people in making better decisions they should and if that means paying people to do the right thing they should but making up countless excuses of how impossible it is is not helpful
OldSchoolCool,removed,its not jealousy its watching them continue to make poor decisions and put their children at risk
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,the argument that you should ignore welfare reform and focus on political reform he totally changed the subject your add is kicking in again
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,youre right cant wait to teach the kids reality of race and logic of its problems
OldSchoolCool,removed,no what you did was make upa straw man argument no one would agree with and say look how racist white people are they hate black widows
OldSchoolCool,removed,there are actually thousands of whites that would want to start a white only colony and just buy the land from a local government but the jew media instantly starts shrieking out of control to destroy it white people arent allowed to escape the multicultural nightmare and so tensions brew and boil who knows what will happen
OldSchoolCool,removed,you want sources on who i think should be supported and who shouldnt be its an opinion i dont think single mothers should be given more money than married women i dont think you should get increased housing allowence based on how many children you have i dont think you should be able to receive benefits if all your children continue to fail at school but i do think you should be rewarded more for keeping your family together when your children do well in school if you go to work for hours a week if you are willing to take a drug test i do t see the point in paying people less when they are improving and when they become self sufficient they can pay taxes like the rest of us
OldSchoolCool,removed,see i wouldnt agree with that
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah speaking of altright those jewish minorities and asian minorities highest us earners sure have it bad why cant some races cut it i guess we shouldnt prod at this question should we we be oppressed stop using asian and jewish success as a counter dey didnt work hard its an ebil whitey plot
OldSchoolCool,removed,lol since when have groups of bored youth forming groups and roaming the neighbourhood ever been peaceful
OldSchoolCool,removed,who do you think teache ps at the inner city school who runs most the aid programs who donates to most the aid programs those pesky racist whites do of course
OldSchoolCool,removed,your claim that white people hate black widows i dont see any evidence for that
OldSchoolCool,removed,people segregate in major cities too only reason whitey gotta stand with darker is stolkholm syndrome
OldSchoolCool,removed,its what black lives matter wants with safe spaces and whites are screaming finally
OldSchoolCool,removed,safe spaces fgt black only safe spaces
OldSchoolCool,removed,damn racist black people didnt want to vote for whitey
OldSchoolCool,removed,years later all parks in america are open to people of all races who want to sell drugs and shoot people progress
OldSchoolCool,removed,i think you went one step too far jews are free to be superior and i believe iq stats for asians are as well and guess what jews and asians are high earners in usa i am a tribalist i just want you to be superior over there
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont think you have read any of my responses to you go on blaming racism i cant help you are you white and racist
OldSchoolCool,removed,and if you think racial progress is a facade and the ebil white debil is still the same fuck it ill be ebil and you can leave me alone now oppressed crybaby
OldSchoolCool,removed,tried to make a thing on college campuses black racists
OldSchoolCool,removed,the super soaker guy sure there are outliers but sub saharan africa did shit for nothing they best argument you have is you wuz us once so stick to that
OldSchoolCool,removed,wasnt asking or needing
OldSchoolCool,removed,no need to dox myself i have done plenty
OldSchoolCool,removed,wrong everyone at all times is being indoctrinated
OldSchoolCool,removed,the same thing he will do to help all americans too bad youre all fucked up racists and making your race the excuse for why you cant do shit here go learn a skill damnit
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah no one would ever believe some races are better at things than others httpimgurcomhqpehdhjpeg
OldSchoolCool,removed,sure it was also not great for all whites either this isnt about your race its about america in whole
OldSchoolCool,removed,then stop typing last word
OldSchoolCool,removed,you know what the most insane thing is they dressed better back then and behaved better i bet those black children were actually polite as opposed to the bitter and angry young black women you find in videos all across youtube and liveleak i also would be willing to bet they were less violent back then than they are now
OldSchoolCool,removed,jews are super fucked up if you dont know whats going on with jews you arnt following the people showing it you dont see much asian hate in there
OldSchoolCool,removed,donald trump isnt far right enough for me
OldSchoolCool,removed,good god im not denying racism but its it doesnt have anything to do with i how i think welfare should be distributed not too many racist social workers either people like you make it impossible to have any kind of understand because you are so obsessed with calling everyone racist its like you think its a moral trump card i called you racist therefor im right and you are wrong upvotes please
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah fuck you black lives matter safe space racists
OldSchoolCool,removed,blame every black person that actually makes something of themselves from running from their people which creates a vacuum in black communities its not our fault you all are race traitor scavengers who dont look after their people imagine if all black people who got careers and got rich stay in the hood and invested in properties and businesses there you are your own worst enemy black people
OldSchoolCool,removed,hey believe what you want and remember you not trying make a food stand or a lawn mowing service or whatever the hell brings you out of sadness is your doing no dey ebil white man
OldSchoolCool,removed,because single parent homes do a much worse job at raising children one of the largest reasons there are so many single mothers under the poverty line is because there is a financial benefit to divorce
OldSchoolCool,removed,saying black people have a crime problem is not cherrypicking shit and degrasse tyson hasnt done shit but be a science cheerleader but i agree with your overall message im just here to shit on the hypocrisy of both sides while being an asshole doing it
OldSchoolCool,removed,income and success determine your worth not iq iq just leads to success look at average iw by race and you can see the direct correlation
OldSchoolCool,removed,and if you cant get past race being the main part of american greatness then you are the racist this is about innovation and leading the way in the world fuck the fall behind crying for their porridge fucking do something worth peoples money nobody stopping blacks from inventing the future and never were get to it black folk you think if when europe ventured into southern africa if they found a superior society that shit wouldnt have surpassed how we live today stop making excuses and either workinnovate to be better or get the hell out of the way for people who can and want to
OldSchoolCool,removed,i just see blacks not sure if theyre from africa
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont go to storefront and sometimes i wonder if this is advertising for it and you are the racist fuck
OldSchoolCool,removed,start counting
OldSchoolCool,removed,im talking to the whole internet here i could care less what race you are but if you have been indoctrinated to think that black people cant do it themselves and need whiteys help you are the racist
OldSchoolCool,removed,same reason africa isnt a developed nation lack of ambitions and generally lower iq and ability for long run planning exists among black communities im not trying to be racist but just look average iq by country and you can see the correlation
OldSchoolCool,removed,not all humans are the same some groups are just not as good as others just google iq average by nation and you can see
OldSchoolCool,removed,and the
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont believe that my personal awakening to the realities of race is with knowledge and research i didnt wake up one day and see the world how it is i followed internet culture of different races statistics trash talk from all sides patterns etc i was a happy go lucky liberal fgt about yrs ago before black lives matter made me research the reality of the situation
OldSchoolCool,removed,they had colour cameras and even colour videos in also its easy to add colour back into a picture
OldSchoolCool,removed,i know exactly what you mean im now so its not bad but as a high school student damn you cant point out that another male has any positive physical redeeming feature without people calling you a homo
OldSchoolCool,removed,the human genome is what holds who we are on a biological level its what tells you how athletic you are when your skin should stop growing your intelligence etc majority of plants and animals share an archaic foundation of the human genome i personally believe the the genes within the human genome make up things to help improve possibility of survival white skin to absorb light black athleticism to deal with africas many predators innovative insight for northern people because of winter more individualist and selfish for tropical people because of natural food abundance
OldSchoolCool,removed,detaching america as a sustaining economic power house has nothing to do with peoples fucking race you want to make america great again for blacks open a damn food stand and get to work that is what trump is fighting for making it easy to come up from nothing not for the people who made it to take care of you
OldSchoolCool,removed,dont forget that everyone can see black culture communication on twitter it aint a private club and you fucks can really get nasty so right back at you
OldSchoolCool,removed,the longer the black man says whitey is bringing him down and not trying to fix their communities and running from it if they get any success the longer the black man imprisons his own people in the vacuum of the hood and isnt free
OldSchoolCool,removed,they would rather have all live third world than someone making it and providing a proper family to bring up proper people for society worlds fucked
OldSchoolCool,removed,i post in news too i post everywhere you know which fascists ban me
OldSchoolCool,removed,omg not the anonymous internet are they all pointing too fuck out fgt
OldSchoolCool,removed,science is about discovery none done shit in years when cosmos comes back and he not the host he wont have any part of relevant science story line the black bill nye
OldSchoolCool,removed,im not talking to you specifically im talking to the hive mind of victims that have ruined all discussion of the reality that drive and intelligence is what gets you somewhere go make an awesome pillow or some shit stop crying
OldSchoolCool,removed,crime rates is almost every western country shows something diff how much correlation should be my gauge
OldSchoolCool,removed,economically yes and if you believe you are still bein held down by day white man then thats on you let make america great economically again with the current social successes of today how is that such a hard thing to get nobody is saying lets get them nggers back in chains with that statement and you are building a boogey man to protect the fact that black people may not be innovated or care as a race to succeed in western culture fuck that open up the gates and prove it
OldSchoolCool,removed,i really liked this show from norway hosted by comedian you should watch it it dabbles in the scientific taboo
OldSchoolCool,removed,stop it the black dude who made the super soaker is way more badass than tyson contribute innovation or new discovery within science something fresh
OldSchoolCool,removed,just realize the current culture would hate dave chapelles old bits if they were repackaged dave chapelle was race relations for a few years then oprah and obama intimidated him and fucked everything up
OldSchoolCool,removed,well judging by black culture on twitter it hasnt stopped we all get to see what the hood talks like now and every finger is pointing somewhere else than themselves
OldSchoolCool,removed,majority of the blacks in europe shitting on everything are muslims and just non religious trash
OldSchoolCool,removed,neither do i but im here to beat it back into submission on all sides america is about letting the people with drive and innovation to climb that should be the american dream not a safety net for the no haves and do nots
OldSchoolCool,removed,i can see how people who cant hop from a to b and c fuck those low iq fgts on every side if you think make america great again is anything more than a summed up slogan on trumps business promises of improving economy you are building boogey men for your own complexes or your just fuckin dumb
OldSchoolCool,removed,httpswwwquoracomwhatdophysiciststhinkaboutneildegrassetyson i will look into your pioneering claims and will give him credit if i find it
OldSchoolCool,removed,well that was before people who werent white were man so it made sense
OldSchoolCool,removed,okay and if black christian males are shitting on things worse that the other christian males we have found the detail and look it matches other countries problems with blacks too
OldSchoolCool,removed,it really isnt innovate something market it and sell it dont let the fear of failure keep you from coming up not every deal goes through not every plan succeed the american dream is creating a culture that fights for the people trying to push humanity forward with innovation not the cry baby saying there is no such thing
OldSchoolCool,removed,bullshit you make yours until they stop you then you give them rightful share no one is stopping innovation i built a few big idea websites a few years ago and when programmers would say am i worried about patents and copyrights i would answer let them sue if you are making big cash everyone will want to keep making it just with their price no patent troll doesnt want people to make their patents they want to scrape off their share if you succeed
OldSchoolCool,removed,black is black and prison numbers everywhere show it keep crying beat around the bush boy
OldSchoolCool,removed,or you could innovate a product and actually do something with your life nah just wait it out whitey will hire me
OldSchoolCool,removed,now you know why blacks are so fucked
OldSchoolCool,removed,making america great again looks like telling black people to build their own damn ferris wheel or stop being oppressed assclowns
OldSchoolCool,removed,whos parents and communities didnt build them a playground
OldSchoolCool,removed,the blacks
OldSchoolCool,removed,innovation drive
OldSchoolCool,removed,hey all that shit started with affirmative action and jim crow i am all for making everyone equal and giving no race a step up on anything
OldSchoolCool,removed,now their grandkids riot and burn cities at least they have inclusion
OldSchoolCool,removed,more like it happened for a reason and the whole west is getting a taste of why in the last few years
OldSchoolCool,removed,bullshit unless trump has ever mentioned bringing back slavery or segregation then it probably does not mean that alright we are talking about the cringy saying trump came up with her not about what everyone and their mother think about when hearing that saying grow the fuck up jesus christ
OldSchoolCool,removed,animals are tribal nature is as metal if not more than humans
OldSchoolCool,removed,just as long as you are not white and a blm event
OldSchoolCool,removed,was it cute tho
OldSchoolCool,removed,alright now go one step deeper and make all that shit divided by race
OldSchoolCool,removed,be blind
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah and make yours to jump ship before hand or you could just be original that has seemed to help people
OldSchoolCool,removed,when the story of science badassery is written tyson wont be found
OldSchoolCool,removed,too bad black folks didnt improve or build anything for themselves
OldSchoolCool,removed,stop saying move the goal posts i have stuck to the original point tyson has done shit to progress science of any importance bye baby
OldSchoolCool,removed,no brown middle easterners are fuck all too asians are pretty cool because they dont crime and stuff lil baby
OldSchoolCool,removed,you should get all the black dads together and build something in your community oh wait black dads
OldSchoolCool,removed,there was a positive trump headline on the front page today darkey just making sure we dont forget about them and our white guilt
OldSchoolCool,removed,ah so we made da white man million years ago time to support our culture of welfare baby mamas and thugs what you are is the same black oppressors that have been geocoding all other humanoids on the planet for the last years neanderthallivesmatter
OldSchoolCool,removed,the sheer fact that generalizing takes into account outliers as not an argument means fuck off
OldSchoolCool,removed,keep going in circles bud he didnt do shit that will be heralded as science breakthroughs he is a parading assclown and i have more respect when it comes to science and innovation as any other black person who did some cool shit but please keep obsessing over his celebrity im pretty much reading the first words you write and responding because its bullshit
OldSchoolCool,removed,bye babyhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgvnztlikqu
OldSchoolCool,removed,the good old days

OldSchoolCool,removed,that wasnt spanish fgt
OldSchoolCool,removed,lol jackass
OldSchoolCool,removed,talk about making up claims you think single mothers get more than married women and its not always a financial benefit to the family but it is to the mother
OldSchoolCool,removed,did you learn that from yakubs diary
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,more like this but cover up your races shortcommings httpwwwedinformaticscominventionsinventors
OldSchoolCool,removed,ah before the smartphone let all the crybaby minorities onto the internet

OldSchoolCool,removed,not everything but damn near plenty this is a backlash on blacks using twitter to try to riot dey oppressed when history of their native lands and every they go they dont innovate shit of build society worth a damn so maybe instead of whitey be deh debil you buck up and start a business or innovate a product thats what the game is
OldSchoolCool,removed,its almost like all successful blacks run from their own people not building their community with local small business and keep the money in the family its almost like blacks are race traitors who spend all their money in white business and put the money back into our system its almost like every successful black guy marries out of race and creates even a worse vacuum its almost like blacks oppress themselves
OldSchoolCool,removed,identity denied

OldSchoolCool,removed,sigh it really was a better time back then as a father of two i absolutely refuse to allow my children near a playground for fear of them being around black children theyre savages and i was born like years too late
OldSchoolCool,removed,you mean white people hadnt discovered it
OldSchoolCool,removed,and for good reason
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah not having the drive to build their own ferris wheel

OldSchoolCool,removed,fuck trump
OldSchoolCool,removed,nope just here to shit on the black folk that tried to use the internet to start a civil war they couldnt win and then got exactly what they didnt want elected into office a successful white man sorry bout that

OldSchoolCool,removed,i like woke because it makes the masses not the enemy just brainwashed and uniformed or misinformed i know mtv made a video saying to stop saying woke but there is a reason the masters dont like it
OldSchoolCool,removed,yes i think multiculturalism is a powderkeg that will explode into a civil war i think the reason there are races is because of this tribal part of us i think that at some point in the future this experiment is going to go up in flames i love the white race and the innovations they gave to create the new world i think their genes need to be preserved and stay around because of the uniqueness i put it on neanderthal dna that is the difference the true oppressor is the homo sapiens african that has been on a year genocide of all other humanoids neanderthallivesmatter the homo sapiens wont be happy until all remaining other humanoids are gone or diluted to the point of not mattering i am not a racist i wish the best for others in the native lands i just want white land especially europe for the white man and woman
OldSchoolCool,removed,it was a dog you fuckboi
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh shit my bad then baby momma half breeds it doesnt matter how you cut it if black people were loyal to race every city would have black dynasties nope i want to be around white people and have white children because i like being white and enjoy white company people are allowed to be tribal and plenty of blacks are too and all the white people that want to mix should be able to but white folk who dont want that should be able to opt out
OldSchoolCool,removed,well now nobody is stopping you and we all have the worlds information at our fingertips for me the clock is ticking for black people to prove themselves and its on them
OldSchoolCool,removed,on social services in fatherless households of men have a felony of murders is usa at population assaults robberies of rapes of interracial crime something is fuckey
OldSchoolCool,removed,hey jew why does israel deport black migrants why do the genetic test for immigration why do they call everyone goy why do they not like when people marry out of tribe dont shit where you eat jew
OldSchoolCool,removed,the reason the jew is cursed is because of their refuge heritage and will always side with the invader they are nation destroyers by default because they think nation is a threat to their livelyhood hitler made the havaara agreement for a reason and helped settle israel he was going to send all jews there without murder months later judea declared war and began to freeze national banking and trade with germany hitler had a plan to transport all jews to israel to bad the jewish apartheid of the native germans betrayed the lower class jew to spit hitlers fight for native freedom history is written by the winners and you shouldnt have a reason to side with me
OldSchoolCool,removed,and they did the same in germany jews are colonizers like whites but they dont give the natives universities or plumbers they just rape and run to the next host
OldSchoolCool,removed,bigot means you dont accept others opinions i am a tribalist i like being around white people and want white children
OldSchoolCool,removed,just as racist as a jew
OldSchoolCool,removed,as long as new innovation happens whitey will be fine httpwwwedinformaticscominventionsinventors
OldSchoolCool,removed,well there is a reason whitey is the one innovating everything and i think the more outside genes that get mixed and with birthrates we are losing humanities scientific progression cash cow every race should want white people growing whites are the minority race on the globe and we bring of new world invention to the table it will be a dark world if whitey left and didnt keep building into the future maybe other races can catch up but historical evidence proves otherwise

OldSchoolCool,removed,the good old days when women were women and you could get laid in the front seat of your car
OldSchoolCool,removed,i hope i dont make you laugh again but i revised my diagram because it seems i had the joints all wrong i must say that in hindsight something looked off about it note that i accounted for the fact that most people have some sort of ass attached to their body so im inclined to believe this one is closer to the truth still something seems off about it i think it would make more sense if her head faced the other way but then again if she did that she would crash her car so shes probably just looking over her shoulder and ass to keep an eye on the road i am consulting my anatomy professor to check whether or not this is more reasonable now mind you i dropped out in first year of med school because i felt like i already knew anything they were going to teach me i once removed a piece of lego from my childhood friends throat after i put it in there hows that for saving lives you dont need a piece of paper to be a good doctor let me tell you that

OldSchoolCool,removed,sorry but your worldview is a feminist one a bit marxist if i might add seeing the world as constant struggle between the opressors and the opressed men vs women et cetera the world is not binary its extraordinarily complex the reason women have given up this kind of work is because they didnt like it it had to be done plain and simple this is known as gender equality paradox where the more gender equality there is the more women tend to choose traditionally feminie traits and roles why because they can also males are better at this kind of job they are more willing to get dirty work longer hours do risky stuff be obsessive and job driven better workers replace current workers spontaneously

OldSchoolCool,removed,no they arent just a couple they are some of the folks that built this nation with their own blood and they were thanked for it by being enslaved they are the ones who defend this nation from harm and are thanked by being massacred they are the ones who today make the lifeblood of what we call culture in the united states and are thanked for it by racism from the top down these people are america not those disgustingly pale freaks that you see elsewhere
OldSchoolCool,removed,its always funny seeing someone unattractive trying to be attractive lol
OldSchoolCool,removed,regardless hes just calling a spade a spade
OldSchoolCool,removed,what the fuck is the black community dont think an entire race has an entire community if your talking about the ghetto thug community than no wonder they dont celebrate successful people
OldSchoolCool,removed,i hope he doesnt feel too cucked when hillary clinches the election
OldSchoolCool,removed,i see old pictures like this and i feel like pre black people were more civilized in this county
OldSchoolCool,removed,daily reminder that of black children born in the us are born to single mothers because the black men run off to cosplay as cent at the local thugcon remember when the black community had black men who had personal responsibility and married women before they impregnated them pepperidge farm remembers
OldSchoolCool,removed,you really do make a good point we are guilty of hyphenating black americans instead of just referring to them as americans we divide them just as much as they divide themselves from us how the fuck do we fix this
OldSchoolCool,removed,u gonna cry
OldSchoolCool,removed,back when the biggest threat to black men wasnt black men leading cause for death for blacks aged is getting killed by another black man blm dont try to improve there communitty they just blame white people hip hop that rakim spawned was about knowledge and empowerment but the mainstream is now perpetuating thug bullshit tupac and biggie where not gangsters there music was social commentary and sadly these stupid kids dont get that and think they promoting gangster shit
OldSchoolCool,removed,its a shame blacks dont act like this nowadays
OldSchoolCool,removed,its not in black people interests to segregate themselves in general they are behind in society and have no powermoney how do you ever expect to move past that if you cut yourselves off from the people doing stuff in this world
OldSchoolCool,removed,i gilded him nice attempt at slander because youre triggered by statistics though
OldSchoolCool,removed,good thing the welfare state destroyed the black family unit
OldSchoolCool,removed,why is she dressed all white
OldSchoolCool,removed,look at her dress you mongoloid
OldSchoolCool,removed,looking sharp they probably handpicked the cotton for their clothes
OldSchoolCool,removed,those is awful nice clothes for a negroyou know hows we feel bout them uppity types
OldSchoolCool,removed,whites were very racist toward blacks however blacks worked hard stuck together helped each other and made their own way in the world without needing a handout from anybody where are blacks today over are born out of wedlock live totally absent of their father the majority of blacks these days are born into poor nieghbourhoods because their mothers got pregnant by some deadbeat dad who totally removed himself from the picture soon after the mother is then unable to work while raising a child surviving on welfare handouts from the state her child then goes to a public school of awful quality because their disctrict gets very little taxpayer funding since unemployment is so high so blacks dont get a satisfactory education this results in them being unable to find work becoming frustrated with the system and likely resorting to crime after perpetuating the cycle by knocking up some chick with a child they never intend on raising that is the sad picture of innercity black kids life this photo of a successful looking black couple getting married represents everything thats needed to fix black communities in america find a job and keep it and dont have children until you are in a committed relationship with a steady income
OldSchoolCool,removed,percent of young black children under age live in poverty workers earning povertylevel wages are disproportionately female black hispanic or between the ages of and did you actually read that source before linking it it seems to support my arguement pretty well black children are born to a single mother and grow up in poverty not to mention the fact that the american poverty line is at for people which is barely being able to afford to eat every day and keep a roof over your head many blacks living above that line still have an awful quality of life due to their financial situation so the number is actually much higher than that source would suggest ill grant you that the were bad for blacks even though i never said they werent and even said myself that they were but that was due to actual systemic racism today there is no systemic racism at all you may think there is but there isnt there isnt any evidence to suggest that there is the system is actually largely designed to benefit blacks in the form of quotas free scholarships affirmative action etc blacks in the good honest hardworking people who were kept down by the racist establishment blacks now by aggregate poor uneducated disproportionately criminal in a society without systemic racism what happened i blame the collapse of the black family unit as was my point from the start blacks mostly have themselves to blame as a community for their current predicament while in the their circumstances were often out of their hands i bet you thought your post was pretty impressive though and it would have been had you not entirely missed the point no one was ever argueing that the were great for blacks
OldSchoolCool,removed,here is my daily dose of black worship on reddit
OldSchoolCool,removed,so your entire point is that blacks today are lazy and not good people i dont know if youre deliberately disingenuous or just stupid its probably the latter or perhaps both my entire point and again im repeating myself is that the majority of blacks these days are born into poor nieghbourhoods because their mother got pregnant by some deadbeat dad who totally removed himself from the picture soon after the mother is then unable to work while raising a child surviving on welfare handouts from the state her child then goes to a public school of awful quality because their disctrict gets very little taxpayer funding since unemployment is so high so blacks dont get a satisfactory education this results in them being unable to find work becoming frustrated with the system and likely resorting to crime after perpetuating the cycle by knocking up some chick with a child they never intend on raising blacks are locked into a cycle of circumstances that perpetuates the poor quality of life that they suffer from compared to other races i actually care about discerning why blacks are disproportionately poor disproportionately resort to crime disproportionately drop out of school you know the things that will actually improve life for black americans do you ever give any thought to that at all or do you just wallow in the smell of your own selfrighteous farts thinking about how youre such a good progressive person because you voted democract again news flash democrats have largely held undisputed control of black majority cities for decades how has that worked out they have become centers of unemployment violence and poverty from my perspective democrats dont actually care about blacks at all they just hand out some welfare and call it a day keep them poor keep them voting left what blacks need are jobs oppurtunities and perhaps most of all fathers fatherlessness is correllated with all sorts of negative social outcomes from suicide rate to homelessness to rates of rape gang violence and aggression so boohoo someone suggested that black families were better a hundred years ago go cry me a river thats not even remotely important to the point whats important is that blacks and sufferring and no one is even talking about how to fix it want to talk about that or will you just continue to point out that whites used to be racist some more
OldSchoolCool,removed,niggerific

OldSchoolCool,removed,this gives me a great idea for an erotic fan fiction edit heres the trump one by request circa late early melania and trump had gone in their first couple of dates and this was melanias first time at donald trumps estate they were enjoying margaritas by the pool where eric and ivanka trump were playing in they had just graduated high school and turned donald made a request to one of his kids eric i believe ms knauss need some more ice do you mind sure no problem eric said leaping out of the pool and coming running over to the kitchen on the surface melania appeared to give him little heed but hidden behind her sunglasses she took the opportunity to look over and appraise the half naked young man donald has said quite a bit about him during their last date melania hi eric thanks for the ice sorry it took so long and here is your ice eric liked it when his dads dates came over they were all very pretty and they were always nice to him donald chided him i was just telling her about your physical dad eric fumed quite exasperated as he started to turn red they didnt believe me when i said told them that you were already developed and were so large dad he was about to die from this embarrassment in fact young man donald ordered why dont you just drop that speedo so ms knauss can see that your dad isnt a liar melania couldnt believe he said that nor could poor eric what you heard me off with it a few seconds went by as he stared him down finally his resolve broke and his hands went to the waist of his swimsuit melania gasped as he whipped the speedo down his cock sprang free oohh my yes you are developed melania lifted up her sunglasses her eyes clearly fastened on his penis and said eric you have nothing to be ashamed of many boys would kill to be hung like you sitting up in her chair to get a better look she continuedya know youre already alot bigger then some full grown men are those kinds of comments continued and under her gaze his member started hardening ooh look exclaimed melaniahes getting an erection eric had shrinkage from the pool but melanias eyes which focused on his penis were like invisble hands stroking his cock it was like someone filling up a water balloon it just started to swell and swell she was shocked into silence as she watched this boy grow a massive erection finally donald broke the silence see melania i do not lie i told you he was fully developed mercifully he said okay thank you eric you can go now eric pulled up the speedo although it was difficult to get it back in now that it had lengthened eric retreated to his room where he played it all back in his head back at the pool ivanka sat speechless as she saw the whole thing go down this was the first time she saw her brother as a man the aristocrats

OldSchoolCool,removed,as the armenian genocide claim mainly uses false information the wiki page is not a real wiki page i encourage all who are interested to learn the facts to below sites
OldSchoolCool,removed,we dont think about it and you assholes that keep bringing it up only make us angry for bringing up old news weve been in wars lost millions upon countless millions of turks and we still serve up our dishes with smiles on our face so keep wasting your time on earth with this subject well see how it pays opf in the end for you

OldSchoolCool,removed,id bump that
OldSchoolCool,removed,deportations were necessary in rebellions as it was the standard european way of dealing with a large rebellious region deportations are not equivalent to genocide
OldSchoolCool,removed,no deportations are removal of people from a location into a different territory actually the turks never did deportations they did relocations because they were relocated to ottoman territory the purpose of the relocations was to distribute the armenian population away from the russianfront and reduce their rebellious capabilities and ability to attack supply routes its basic military strategy turkish soldiers were ordered to protect armenians during relocations there was no annihilation plans or speeches even
OldSchoolCool,removed,million armenians never died thats an impossibly ridiculous number there were barely million armenians in the whole region exaggerating numbers doesnt make you a more convincing argument it just ruins your credibility on the issue should be labeled is symantics its not semantics its the very legal definition of the legal term you are using and the death marched were very real as they deported thousands of people no they werent they were moved with convoys and supplies under protection of the ottoman soldiers
OldSchoolCool,removed,where are you getting this propaganda ataturk never said anything about armenian genocide it wasnt even an allegation by armenians back then the allegation started after the jews got reparations from germany when armenians said hey we can do that too if we exaggerate enough explicitly stated they wanted to exterminate armenians as a people nope stick to something youre good at history isnt your thing and you shouldnt attempt to talk about it considering i have a degree in history and you dont i think you should shut your mouth
OldSchoolCool,removed,even when deserving independence and not deserving local crimes against armenians even with all that you still cannot equate it to genocide had you been born a turk raised up to the ranks of ottoman leadership youd have probably done the same exact things
OldSchoolCool,removed,no it isnt generally accepted it is accepted by wikipedia where there are large groups of englishspeaking armenians and thats about it no the video does not say million ever it says close to a million the typical accepted number being around to of which many of them were relocations to usrussiafrance
OldSchoolCool,removed,they had a kangaroo court organized by the british who aided those rebels thats not a real ataturk quote you sound like an armenian nationalist who refuses to accept reality about the many turks the armenians massacred and believes in some fantasy of extermination that never happened
OldSchoolCool,removed,dont be alarmed thats what pussys looked like in the
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh bullshit my grandparents grew up in the hills of missouri during the depression no way in fucking hell would they or anyone else give a girl that age what is she all of a and let her go hunt squirrels that photo is staged and probably not even your grandma reddit is full of fucking liars

OldSchoolCool,removed,i went to mcdonalds today and got a filetofish combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side i was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audiobook when i glanced up and saw the mcdonalds worker i ordered outside having a cigarette she waved at me and i nodded and had to wait minutes before she went back inside and i could eat in comfort again i dont think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the mcdonalds restaurant or drive through but that is another story i went to mcdonalds for dinner tonight and got a mcchicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side as i was driving to the second window the same girl was still working she was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked why dont you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot where it is cold that really bothered me for many reasons first of all i dont want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee secondly she should not try to tell me how i should live my life i do not want to eat inside because i find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy overall i think it was very unprofessional to bring this up i should have a clean slate with each drive through visit not have to get the third degree because i committed some sort of faux pas which i dont think i did because i often see people eating in fast food parking lots how does she know i am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush how do you feel about eating in your vehicle in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant versus eating inside the restaurant

OldSchoolCool,removed,my little stalker you may try to point the finger at me and cry racist but the ghettos in milan are not the product of my imagination the old via gluck is now a chinatown and last time i went to stazione centrale the situation was unpleasant i say that things have changed in milan and there is no one that can argue about this fact not even a commie like you so dont even try the racist card with me
OldSchoolCool,removed,youll find concentrated areas of certain groups in most countries and it sucks balls
OldSchoolCool,removed,this is the central station it looks like a lazaret too bad the pics cant give you the strong smell of pee that surround the area scabies tbc meningitis all good things you can get thereand lets avoid to talk about the crimes httpwwwtodayitcronacarifugiatimilanoscabbiahtml this is what mass immigration and globalization have brought to milan dont you feel enriched
OldSchoolCool,removed,are you really trying to make accept this decadence by arguing that it is natural and it is not
OldSchoolCool,removed,hot till they lift their arms and you see the furry pit monster
OldSchoolCool,removed,what are accusing me for stalker you are even admitting that the things i am saying are true the pathetic thing you are trying to do is to argue that they are propaganda you are the one that have a twisted agenda you are the one who is trying to suppress the truth by calling it propaganda if you have some real argument that can prove that the few things i said where not true please share it
OldSchoolCool,removed,milan theyre in burkas
OldSchoolCool,removed,so i got stalked called racist for saying the truth and now i am immature for fighting back no way some people have a problem to distinguish between reality and fantasy you can wish that mass immigration was a good thing for milan it does not change the outcome you can wish some stupid shit about my organs but it does not change the reality you can even wish you mom was a virgin for what does concern me
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont really have the concept of edgy but i think that people who enjoy decadence and the smell of shit are more edgy than people who want to live in a decent society
OldSchoolCool,removed,man i am sorry but is like if you expect to go in london and find the city of the victorian era nowadays at least the of the population is made by immigrants httpsitwikipediaorgwikimilanoetnieeminoranzestraniere in the the city was quite monoethnic and the problem was the immigration from the south of italy
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh the myth of we are all immigrants cute you know the internal immigration is quite different and far less traumatic than mass immigration from oversea
OldSchoolCool,removed,century crusades
OldSchoolCool,removed,i am an immigrant so yeah i like to think that immigrants like all people are good and bad i am sorry for your generalization immigrants are not all the same thing their different cultural identity is a key factor that determine the kind of integration you can expect what they used to write about southerners in the and and see how they described internal immigration same thing i bet i will not find lots of articles about the risk of religious terrorism made by southern catholic groups i repeat myself it is wrong to generalize different groups have different level of integration and yet without those people milano would be poorer today how does this thing works when i see a homeless immigrant that survive thanks to the welfare or a pusher i have to think think about the southerns that went here to work their ass off in the
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,people here have said that the city have not changed from the i say that it is a big fat lie and also dishonest for the people who wants to go in milan with certain kind of expectations who goes to london expecting a victorian city maybe it is not the case but there have been other similar cases httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjfkdzxuwhkk the demography and the ethnicity are the things that changed most in the past years people call me racist i just dont want this alienation that globalization is causing
OldSchoolCool,removed,its already happening
OldSchoolCool,removed,and they say people dress slutty now
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,again you are mixing things how can you compare an crime organization that is made in order to make profit with terrorist groups that seeks the destruction of local people and to overthrown the system in order to please a god and i dont know about sicilians and mafia but muslims who practices terrorism against infidels are not going against the culture offered by their holy book also i share the same law the same values with southern italians do you share the same values with people who are from countries with sharia as i said the internal immigration is a thing this kind of mass immigration is another

OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,its actually an experiment if people will feed the troll since im asking for downvotes im surprised theyre downvoting rather than keeping me at exactly or
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,good thing you know exactly what people meant it would have been bad to accuse me to be obsessed on the basis of an assumption says more about your obsession towards different looking people different not integrated people means also different storesthere are stores in milan that dont even have an italian name different clothes hijab i cannot tell if this ladies were italian or not and they are too much integrated in the society unlike some people now
OldSchoolCool,removed,urine and shit are the smell that mass immigration have brought to us it is not a joke it is not a metaphor this is the miasma you will smell as soon as you enter in the train station you are defending a system that is worsening a city a country and a continent and yet you define me edgy and ignorant am i i dont like the smell of urine and shit does this make me edgy i think that you are the ignorant since you dont know what are you talking about you are so ignorant that you dont even know the smell of an immigrant i dare you to go to the milan train station nighttime you would feel the enrichment
OldSchoolCool,removed,whats really interesting is that the downvotes almost completely stopped the moment i posted the comment you replied to why was the username not enough to stop them from wanting to downvote but being told its an experiment does
OldSchoolCool,removed,i mean i live in a scandinavian city we have many stores that have englishlanguage names i dont see anyone complaining this explain a lot and whats wrong with wearing hijabs or any different clothes i dont know man there is anything wrong in refusing the local customsand to blend in they are actively refusing integration this is a problem
OldSchoolCool,removed,a woman walking like that now would be raped by the dozen of rabid dogs walking milan
OldSchoolCool,removed,oldchoolsluts
OldSchoolCool,removed,tell that to the countless italian families here in ireland i do that already it is the duty of every immigrant to integrate as much as it is possible also the fact that you are an immigrant that advocates for the melting pot makes you an hypocrite in my modest opinion irish people have fought for centuries for their land and their identity and now they are suppose to screw everything iin order to have a shitty melting pot fuck that
OldSchoolCool,removed,if only women looked like this today now they just look like cheap imitations with faggy tats
OldSchoolCool,removed,bush hair
OldSchoolCool,removed,its not my job to pull your head out of the sand if you want to leave it there you can
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah ho k
OldSchoolCool,removed,i am just astonished and i dont know what to saythere are so many things that have sense here the melting pot will not create a new identity for you the melting pot is in fact the lack of an identity the lack of integration there is no solidariety in a society like that well my country was made in a bloodbath against foreigners that lasted centuries and cost the life of millions giobertione of the father of my nation wanted to make a country that was and i quote one in blood language and religion now does this looks like a melting pot for you
OldSchoolCool,removed,someone needs to rename roldschoolcool to roldschoolfap
OldSchoolCool,removed,scandinavian countries have the reputation of being too tollerant which is the worst reputation you can have in this meatgrinder called earth why do people have to blend in a country or an area with too many people with different values is not a good thingthe history of balkans is a good example of that or the history of africa or the recent history of middle east or the history of mankind in general your people are making very few children right at the same time you are taking in many immigrants from cultures that makes lots of babiesif things will keep going like that in a some decades your people will be the minority in your own countryat that point i don t see the reason for keeping your flag your constitution and your language are you ok with that
OldSchoolCool,removed,i heard that they moved some immigrants during the expo but i bet that some of them were still there or they are there nowand i bet that i can still smell that enriching smell of progress you people are strangeyou defend mass immigration but you dont want to admit the evident problem in fact you dont even want to acknowledge the smell of pee of the immigrants who pee around a train station it is like that you are a little bit delusional
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,i do watch a lot of beast porn tbh
OldSchoolCool,removed,its really hot if you actually get into it i especially love seeing hot guys sucking offgetting fucked by big dogs
OldSchoolCool,removed,because ive been busy with human men
OldSchoolCool,removed,he joined in and sucked the dogs cum out of me
OldSchoolCool,removed,the tips probably longer than my whole lower body so yeah
OldSchoolCool,removed,my point is fairly accurate then how long would the tip of a blue whale dick be also ive heard they can get up to feet in dick size
OldSchoolCool,removed,i could take some of it probably maybe the whole head
OldSchoolCool,removed,jesus christ i hadnt even thought of that its gotta be wider than my whole body though id think
OldSchoolCool,removed,i mean if its got a foot long dick its gotta be at least or so feet around otherwise itd be thinner than a pencil
OldSchoolCool,removed,wouldnt it be thicker though on a living specimen
OldSchoolCool,removed,that picture on wikipedia is of the tip of a blue whale penis the whole thing would be the tip and its long
OldSchoolCool,removed,not when you cum before youre even all the way in it isnt
OldSchoolCool,removed,did you have the biggest dick of all your friends
OldSchoolCool,removed,i mean what if it was a tame bull
OldSchoolCool,removed,i would without a doubt
OldSchoolCool,removed,because im not but seriously a large dogs knot is about as big around as a large fist and once it swells it can stay lodged there for some time thatd be an awfulamazing way to die though
OldSchoolCool,removed,because i can already imagine how my funeral would go if i choked to death on a dog dick fucking hilariously awkward and also the newspaper headlines too
OldSchoolCool,removed,thats an excellent idea my obituary would probably end up on runexpected
OldSchoolCool,removed,id honestly like to die in an awkward hilarious way if i was ever going to kill myself i probably would intentionally choke to death on a dog dick just for the lulz
OldSchoolCool,removed,not as sensational as choking on doggy cock though
OldSchoolCool,removed,i just might year old florida woman chokes to death on her german shepards penis more at

OldSchoolCool,removed,it wasnt because she lost people turned on her it was the way she acted in defeat when she lost she went into hiding she ran to the airport covering her head up when she finally did an interview she said she wanted to quit the ufc said she wanted to kill herself said she didnt want to live anymore and the only thing that kept her going was that she wants to have travis browns babies now ignoring the fact that shes a massive hypocrite talking against domestic violence and then dating travis browne taking a defeat like this is cowardice and absolutely bullshit you have to look at the way conor mcgregor took his defeat to nate diaz as a true comparison how a martial artist and a champion responds to defeat conor congratulated nate said he was the better man on the night but that he wanted an immediate rematch conor didnt shy away from the defeat didnt make excuses for being beaten rematched diaz under the same weight class and beat him ronda is like a spoiled bitch was only happy wrecking girls in a division where no one was good until the ufc signed up some legit competition for her and then she noped the fuck out thats why people hate ronda now its not because of her loss its because of the way she acted and couldnt take her loss

OldSchoolCool,removed,the yellow star was invented by muslims though
OldSchoolCool,removed,funny how they have explicit multiple passages in their holy books about brutally murdering and forcing all people of the book to islam get this fucking shit out of here
OldSchoolCool,removed,thankfully not
OldSchoolCool,removed,lets not forget the fact the muslims generally hate jews
OldSchoolCool,removed,sorry if you truly believe the shit in islam you cannot be a decent person and yes ill happily say the same about christians
OldSchoolCool,removed,did you just assume my neighbor
OldSchoolCool,removed,ooh how about in when a muslim woman detonated in tel aviv to protect jews from living
OldSchoolCool,removed,why do you support the holocaust so much why cant you let jews be jewish youre literally hitler
OldSchoolCool,removed,id rather you stop promoting and accepting a religion that promotes antilgbt antiwomen and overall antiequality ideology its disgusting that hate groups like islam still even exist today
OldSchoolCool,removed,it is strange to think how the jews push for cultural marxism diversity and cultural enrichment to wipe out the white race by mass importing hundreds of thousands of sharia fighting age male refugees who will then target and eliminate the jews they are like a snake eating its own tail
OldSchoolCool,removed,too bad muslims arent this nice now
OldSchoolCool,removed,why do you hate free speech so much just because a muslim years ago hid a golden star with a veil doest mean they can shoot up gay nightclubs and plow through crowds of people at a christmas market likewise just because the holocaust happened doesnt mean the jews get to steal land in the middle east cry somewhere else snowflake
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah detonate in public and get virgins this woman mustve misunderstood something
OldSchoolCool,removed,all muslim majority countries proudly execute or imprison their gay citizens including teenagers while the western world just finished granting its gay children marriage equality theres over a year cultural difference between us and thats nothing to be proud of no youre not ok youre a moral and cultural failure by the standards of the civilized world and no being culturally oppressed by the civilized world and being inflicted with liberalism is not a moral achievement
OldSchoolCool,removed,ugh one shitty religious behavior to another
OldSchoolCool,removed,i cant help but feel if you need to scrounge the history books to find an example of a muslim helping a jew or even feel that the story of a muslim jelping a jew is newsworthythen theres a big fucking problem cool picture though
OldSchoolCool,removed,your wifes boyfriend is probably very proud of you
OldSchoolCool,removed,im literally going to stick around until all content on this site is absolute shit to the point where the mods cant censor it because its all the content there is whats udez going to do shut down the servers forever ill watch this place become
OldSchoolCool,removed,calling people names sure worked out well for you last election keep it up and is in the bag
OldSchoolCool,removed,one of the most famous pieces of nazi propaganda was the use of the book germay must perish a nonfiction work by a jew calling essentially for the extermination of the german people this book was used by nazis over and over again to make the argument that jews wanted total conversion of germans or their death a book published in long after the nazis went on their gas the kikes european tour the book also wasnt the holy book of the jewish religion and the perfect unquestionable word of god yeah just a slight difference between it and the koran dont forget that the beginning of kristallnacht and the holocaust was brought about by the reichstag fire lol no the beginning of the holocaust was brought about by centuries of europeans hating the successful jews who lived among them the jews didnt suddenly invade europe by the millions and apply for welfare while blowing up the local eating establishment and raping the local women again just slight differences
OldSchoolCool,removed,they wouldnt be so greatly disliked if they didnt explode in public at least twice a week
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah ok we understand islam is a beautiful religion of peace while all christians are scum sarcasm
OldSchoolCool,removed,that blacks are still oppressed by white people and that muslims champion and protect jews and as a whole have no reason to hate them
OldSchoolCool,removed,imagine going through all this just to become a bar of soap
OldSchoolCool,removed,jews amirite guys too ez
OldSchoolCool,removed,yea you are by being muslim im also gay good luck with that
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh wow cool one muslim covered up one star long enough for one picture to be taken meanwhile muslims routinely commit acts of terror such as the orlando night club shooting or that charlie hebdo massacare but they totally get a free pass for that because of a year old picture why are athiests so stupid arent you supposed to be the smart ones you oughtta be embarassed
OldSchoolCool,removed,stuff like this makes up for the modern killing raping womensupressing clitorischopping childbriding machine that islam has become pfft i can find pics of yazidi women being used as sex slaves and discarded in manners which would be considered bad treatment for livestock httpswwwzerocensorshipcomsearchisis try that out for a dose of realreality
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont think muslims are our friends
OldSchoolCool,removed,lmao what muslim woman all i see is two massive black blotches in the picture
OldSchoolCool,removed,trump has children of them are married or dating jews
OldSchoolCool,removed,violence is the basis of islam the book says to kill homosexuals and disobedient women and any infidel who doesnt follow islam where is the outrage from the feminist and sjw movements too busy trying to protect a religion that wants them deadits pure irony
OldSchoolCool,removed,hitler admired islam for being a war based religion hitler hated jews because jews much like today controlled a large amount of the media outlets and hitler believed they were using this for communist propaganda hitler also hated jews because out of the commanders of the communist revolution of germany of them were jewish
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh yeah notallmuslims but somehow all cops are racist and we should string up all christians because they dont want to bake cakes for people and get out of here with your dumb buzzwords thier beliefs are incompatible with western culture theyre just gonna keep killing until we give in hopefully they start getting the dumb ones like you so we can start to fix this problem the left created
OldSchoolCool,removed,yes it is
OldSchoolCool,removed,in the words of the great trump wrong
OldSchoolCool,removed,its also cute when they drive over kids in christmas markets while you limp wristed pansies are too scared to even address the issue let alone do anything about it
OldSchoolCool,removed,the winners write the history and the jews won so none of this surprises me
OldSchoolCool,removed,pretty sure he is muslim so no offense he is borderline in hatejewhateinfidle scale i give that prettt normie
OldSchoolCool,removed,not racism if we hate everybody hate is a beautiful thing
OldSchoolCool,removed,iirc ever since he didnt support hillary hes no longer a member of the protected class african american but now a fucking stupid uncle tom a transformation that highlights the signature tolerance of the left of accepting those left behind as long as they vote for you
OldSchoolCool,removed,the truth is they controlled the banks and the media as they still do today its the incessant meddling they do and destruction of their host countries that pisses people off youtube xpnypqahauc
OldSchoolCool,removed,they are evil
OldSchoolCool,removed,hmmgreatest story never told
OldSchoolCool,removed,its ok nobody likes sjws theyre fading in numbers and all they do is act rude and annoy people with their rainbow colored hair and standardissue nose ring and armpit hair theyre the least desires of all the types of people and hopefully wont breed
OldSchoolCool,removed,ad hominem at its finest the only thing the left has is logical fallacies and its fucking hilarious is in the bag have fun with years of trump and ted cruz on the sc if you keep this up soon well be able to change the constitution unopposed because you guys are that weak of an opponent
OldSchoolCool,removed,sjw retards thats why
OldSchoolCool,removed,school and most of the marxists here are lying to you go watch the greatest story never told and ask yourself why churchill said germanys unforgivable crime before was its attempt to loosen its economy out of the world trade system and to build up an independent exchange system from which the worldfinance couldnt profit anymore we butchered the wrong pig
OldSchoolCool,removed,sounds good i think the world needs more diversity we need to have a ton of white people move to the middle east and africa clearly they are not diverse enough
OldSchoolCool,removed,not sure what your point is
OldSchoolCool,removed,the truth of the statement is what matters
OldSchoolCool,removed,no positivity is for pussies
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah my candidate is currently under criminal investigation but she has a vagina wait youre not voting for her fuck you youre a sexist fucking idiot hhey how did i lose wwell itll work next time i hope so easy
OldSchoolCool,removed,and whiteness is evil and must be crushed out right
OldSchoolCool,removed,i do not associate with those things and before you answer it doesnt matter they believe and support a book that condones violence same as christianity and judaism theyre all shitty if they were good people theyd throw the book and the religion out the window simple as that convo
OldSchoolCool,removed,your wikipedia article is likely wrong half of modern history is if jews didnt want germans to go after them they shouldnt have tried to destroy it
OldSchoolCool,removed,concession not offered youre confused its not surprising you make up history and you make up your own victories
OldSchoolCool,removed,hhey no one is committing an act of terror in this picture there isnt a problem with islam this picture is proof why are liberals so dumb your only solution to problems is to pretend they dont exist until someone else comes along and fixes it
OldSchoolCool,removed,wrong
OldSchoolCool,removed,is there another point to reddit trollllolololololol
OldSchoolCool,removed,too bad that novadays muslims kill and hunt jewish people where ever they go
OldSchoolCool,removed,someone did something awful to someone you dont like you should celebrate not everyone is as mean spirited and spiteful as the left sorry
OldSchoolCool,removed,yes its fun to shit on everyone and everything especially an evil religion
OldSchoolCool,removed,its virtually impossible to be vocal about jews as they control the world and will throw you in jail in many places for pointing out what they do
OldSchoolCool,removed,positivity is for pansies
OldSchoolCool,removed,exactly the people in this pic are dumb
OldSchoolCool,removed,when will these pansies ever learn this
OldSchoolCool,removed,now if only the opinions on reddit were real life wed have a socialist jew running things and everything would be free too bad outside this niche circle jerk everybody thinks youre an idiot and rightly so
OldSchoolCool,removed,ironically the country is overrun by muslims now furthermore the jewish zionists have pushed immigration everywhere but israel moreover the jews control the media and our banking system seems to me hitler had some good ideas
OldSchoolCool,removed,wrong some of us just like to see the world burn and argue about everything
OldSchoolCool,removed,nazis all white people today
OldSchoolCool,removed,just like the woman in the picture missed the kill all infidels lesson in the mosque actually now that i think about it its because she probably wasnt allowed to leave the house
OldSchoolCool,removed,the jews are trying to end white people they literally control the world youve been lied to and bought into propaganda go to raltright to learn the truth yes there is racism there ignore that part and focus on the jewish influence links learn the truth httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxpnypqahauc
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh wow lets just go ahead and judge an entire group of people based on the actions of a few ok now tell me about how all cops are racists all christians are homophobic all white people are responsible for slavery and that all nazis were evil oh whats that
OldSchoolCool,removed,hey they started it with and all the terrorist attacks since then im allowed to be and i like hating ill hate all i want until theyre all deported hopefully maybe they shouldve thought about it first before following a religion based on violence
OldSchoolCool,removed,the people who wanted us gone white people huh yeah we know you jews hate us
OldSchoolCool,removed,if the amish controlled the banks and the media and were actively trying to end white people then that would be true you know this though seriously do you think hitler just decided to out of the blue be against jews httpthezoginfolistsummaries httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxpnypqahauc
OldSchoolCool,removed,if youre gay a woman that doesnt submit to a man or dont follow the religion then yes they would if they were a true muslim they have to their own book says so
OldSchoolCool,removed,in case you dont know
OldSchoolCool,removed,cuz theyre bad they support an imaginary god that says to kill gays women and non believers they have to by gods law or theyre are not a true muslim if theyre not evil they wouldve rejected the whole religion by now
OldSchoolCool,removed,good times
OldSchoolCool,removed,well what did henry ford say
OldSchoolCool,removed,my idea of what a solution is and your idea differ your idea of a solution is to sit there and oppose any possible solution that might be implemented for fear of offending anyone because god forbid someone has thier feelings hurt when they can detonate in public instead does not mean ill just wait for someone else to fix the problem oh yeah lets take a look at what obama did he spent years pretending it doesnt exist while blaming firearms and workplace violence he refused to even call the issue by name he didnt even say radical islamic terrorism not even in an nonaccusatory way until trump busted his balls about it hillary was also seemingly content with leaving it be because we had bigger fish to fry like the russians i cant remember the last time a russian shot up a gay night club but i digress so far the official liberal position on the issue is what issue and youll get stomped out in this issue every time it comes up in fact i think making statements such as suggesting a muslim registry be implemented probably shored up islamic terror organizations recruitment for the foreseeable future oh no they implied that i might be a terrorist because of my religion i better become a terrorist now thats the tipping point clearly if thats all it takes to make someone a terrorist we dont need them
OldSchoolCool,removed,dont plan on staying alive forever lol
OldSchoolCool,removed,absolutely all abrahamic religions are built on violence and death
OldSchoolCool,removed,no its just a fact are you not aware of the death and murders order by all the religions under the same god that wants all gays and unruly women dead and death to non believers as well
OldSchoolCool,removed,you must be a college kid come back when you get a job and see the government is taking of your paycheck then tell me youd be fine with the government taking twice that just so some junkie gets to survive an od and live to do it again next week
OldSchoolCool,removed,nah im fine i like shitting on things that deserve to be shat on like religion
OldSchoolCool,removed,no i know what you mean just because one muslim hides a star of a jew doesnt mean theyre all good people if youve watched the news youd see they often commit acts of terror in many parts of the world sorry but photo from does not represent the muslim populace bigot
OldSchoolCool,removed,doesnt make me not right everything i said is true the religions condone outright murder if you do not follow their religions as well or disobey sorrynotsorry
OldSchoolCool,removed,im the asshole cuz i dont support any abrahamic religion like islam or christianity that condones murder of gays disobedient women condones rape condones slavery by law from their god yeah ok right
OldSchoolCool,removed,not knowing how to spot a troll
OldSchoolCool,removed,then they should throw out their entirely book and religion because by the book they are not true christians or muslims its hypocrisy
OldSchoolCool,removed,interesting how they went from this to the disgusting savages they are today
OldSchoolCool,removed,go to malmÃ¸ sweden and youll see jews being harassed and assaulted by muslims constantly the most prevalent hatecrime in the west is muslim on jew but that doesnt fit the buzzfeed narrative that most redditors have
OldSchoolCool,removed,actually i probably know more about religion than you but mainly because its immoral to support or condone the belief of a god that wants unruly kids to be murdered at the edge of town women to be murdered by their husbands if disobedient a god that supports slavery are you saying you support any of these abrahamic religions that believe in this type of a god
OldSchoolCool,removed,ok then have fun supporting a god that wants women to marry their rapist and slavery even the enslavement of his chosen jewish people beyond the year limit im sure you knew all of that
OldSchoolCool,removed,terrorist
OldSchoolCool,removed,i say you need to brush up on why you support a murderous god that wants women to marry their rapist and that same god condones slavery and the enslavement of his own chosen jewish people you support that abrahamic god all of the big religions believe in the god that wants unruly children killed at the edge of town and women to be killed by their husbands if she is disobedient
OldSchoolCool,removed,aw thats special
OldSchoolCool,removed,it doesnt matter it means theyve sacrificed their humanity because theyre too afraid to think for themselves and kept believing in the same heinous religion their parents indoctrinated them into and dont even bother to read a word of how the god of all of those big religions condones slavery and all the special laws that kept slavery going it doesnt fucking matter they shouldve thought about the bullshit that theyre are gonna carry with them in that religious baggage are you saying you support that same god that wants women to marry their rapist if they are raped because the father of the woman can no longer use her as property you support the god that allows slavery
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah and ive kept my humanity by not believing in the abrahamic god that allows slavery and rape of women are you saying you do
OldSchoolCool,removed,why because i dont support anybody that supports a god that wants slavery and murder of any unruly children how does that make sense you saying you do too
OldSchoolCool,removed,christianity read deuteronomy read exodus holy fucking shit are you kidding me have you not read all christian laws as stated in old and new testament they explicitly tell you all of this and you doubt i dont know more about you wow
OldSchoolCool,removed,how i didnt write those religious laws those are the laws of moses for jews and christians both of them believe in a god that supports this and im the immoral one fuck that im realistic and you didnt answer my question you cowered away do you support or believe in that god its a yes or no response
OldSchoolCool,removed,good to see minorities sticking up for each other against the whites
OldSchoolCool,removed,i know they dont and thats how i know they havent bothered to read of their holy book because it does and it explicitly tells you in all laws of moses all of this who you can enslave and for how long and how much and how long you can beat your slave they sacrificed their humanity to believe in a god they havent bothered reading a word of and thats why i dont support any pos that blindly follows this shit if they didnt support that type of god they would throw out their religion all together then but they wont cuz theyre weak
OldSchoolCool,removed,uhh you just made so many fallacious arguments cuz you know youre wrong about how abrahamic religions works lol answer the question do you support that god that condones slavery its all the same abrahamic god
OldSchoolCool,removed,sjws are lame and are a waste of any cognitive resources
OldSchoolCool,removed,haha the nazis were in cahoots with organised religion such as islam and christianity to murder as many jews as possible this is just more propaganda from liberals designed to make you think o cool islam i guess is not bad at all i dont need to read the quran or history of islam i just need to scream racist at anyone who says anything bad about islam or i can just say its ok when islam does it today because the christians got to do it already
OldSchoolCool,removed,youre just mad cause this post aint glorifying white people fuck outta here with shit and fuck you all every white person thats in your family tree
OldSchoolCool,removed,yay now we can forget everything else hahahahhaah
OldSchoolCool,removed,its in the quran we all know that they have to kill the infidels to join or die christianity is more notorious i reject all abrahamic religions the bible is a book full of the same god condoning murder and rape and slavery you saying you support this same god
OldSchoolCool,removed,you do realize the abrahamic god that all of the big religions worships explicitly condones rape and murder and slavery right youve read all of moses laws right are you saying you support that god that says if a woman is raped she has to marry her rapist since she is i longer of any use to her father that god set rules on who you can enslave and for how long and how to enslave your fellow jew forever after years and how long you can beat your slaves that god you support that god
OldSchoolCool,removed,what stop this bullshit what happened to the jews is not happening to muslims ffs this fake shit and victim complex that everyone has about islam is ridiculous the muslims themselves have done their own holocausts since their rise in the middle east muslims are not vilified in western society not are they persecuted in fact jews western society and anything non muslim is vilified in islam and they are taught to hate us this liberal nonsense about the poor muslims is just a complete lie islam harbours dangerous ideas with the backing of a divine force islam is structured purely as a weapon and a brain washing mechanism there is nothing redeeming about the religion except the people who dont follow islam but still blindly claim they are muslim try sailing a ship of people to a muslim country and see what they do to you enslave the men rape the women and kids
OldSchoolCool,removed,cant believe this post is being downvoted the desperation by liberals to paint muslims as the new holocaust victims is so disturbing they really want to white knight around muslims so they can be seen as heroes but countless stories of women trying to help muslims they end up raped and killed glad to see some sanity from a few individuals fighting back against this evil propaganda that all muslims are just victims
OldSchoolCool,removed,they downvoted you haha weve been at war with islam for centuries suddenly because globalism is a wonderful concept for squeeking every last profit margin possible exists were suddenly importing every bit of trash we can get and we should love it
OldSchoolCool,removed,most of the downvoting is from bots spineless lefties probably only make up of the downvotes they love feminism but love islam too strange world
OldSchoolCool,removed,the difference being that muslims actually teach this to reach other the annihilation of all non muslims or the conversion of them the nazis wrote a book vilifying the jews that said untrue things of what jews believed well the muslims wrote a book which actually fucking contains all those horrible ideas of jihad and annihilation of non muslims and they believe it no one put out a fake book on muslims this is the problem with terrorist sympathisers they just refuse to read the quran the hadiths and look at islamic society objectively
OldSchoolCool,removed,the love for islam on reddit is perplexing you dont see waves of americans and europeans daeshing off to islamic countries for the cool culture and quality of life
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah
OldSchoolCool,removed,ok then take the bible i rattle off a ton of same god that endorses murder rape and slavery it doesnt matter jews christian muslim all three worship the same tyrannical god you are aware of the laws of moses right
OldSchoolCool,removed,targeted the wrong people
OldSchoolCool,removed,existing makes you facist apparently
OldSchoolCool,removed,its a great place isnt it
OldSchoolCool,removed,itd be an interesting test
OldSchoolCool,removed,just compare the sorts of things jews have done for the world with what muslims did to the world
OldSchoolCool,removed,kek
OldSchoolCool,removed,because thats wrong you retard jews are a race and a religion they follow the jewish faith and originally came from the area known as judea
OldSchoolCool,removed,of course you can compare different groups retard go and live in the most muslim place on earth ill live in the most jewish place on earth there should not be a difference because everyone is equal all groups are equally productive and since you claim we cant possibly know which society is superior to another one i could pick any people i choose fuck science reason and evidence because when your leftist feelings are hurt you can not only quantify wealth but also how intelligent different groups of people are iq of muslims is far inferior to that of jews just look at the nobel price share each has got in proportion to their number
OldSchoolCool,removed,muslim has zero connection to genetics moron how fucking stupid are you
OldSchoolCool,removed,it doesnt matter if theyre not gonna follow their holy book then there is no point in being religious then it is all or nothing you either believe in a god or dont and if they do then they are worshipping that immoral idea of a god thats all that matters it comes down to that atheistic you either believe or you dont believe in a god theres no grey area everybody knows this and has been beaten to death in the atheist community
OldSchoolCool,removed,islam is a religion not a race you moron the left are the racist ones by promoting racialism as truth and engaging in identity politics i have never once seen anyone antiislam say anything racist yet liberals like you insist race exists there is no such thing as race racialism is a belief liberals are the one pushing collectivist ideologies like racialism you are the ignoring logic and science you have provided zero proof of your claims and are thus lying i remember when it was neocon suddenly they stopped existing and the new buzzword is altright so thank you for once again proving libtards are salty butthurt name callers this canadian liberal is fucking ashamed of you american fucks on both sides of the spectrum fuck you and your identity politics
OldSchoolCool,removed,wow what a compelling argument
OldSchoolCool,removed,rofl shakira law youre wrong though even white german converts to islam are having a lot of kids if you knew anything about islam youd know it orders them to make children to outnumber the kafir when they get to modern nations they end up having more children survive and dont reduce birth rates then toss in everyone elses birth rate is falling still and you arent comparing fertile populations to fertile population you are counting seniors in your statistics about future population and ignoring they wont have children islam will with time dominate the entire planet there is no stopping it it will come down to atheists vs muslims and well probably prefer nuking the planet into a nuclear winter than let islam win all we need to do is not allow muslims to congregate in ghettos like europe has done in canada we spread the muslims out so their kids in assimilate however once they start a islamic school we basically create a terrorism cell my province had over a hundred muslims join isis entire province is only million weve already lost youll be relying on us atheists to exterminate islam and once we have power were not gonna stop with islam well kill all the christians jews and scientologists we can get our hands on so its a race to see if atheists or muslims win im betting muslims win because the quran instructs them to obey our laws until their numbers can influence us and then impose sharia and itll probably work
OldSchoolCool,removed,iq is a fact even if you deny it reality does not care about your feelings
OldSchoolCool,removed,explain to me how the contributions of say aborigines are equal to that of whites easy challenge if you think the equality of all groups is a defensible position
OldSchoolCool,removed,sigh you are or youre not your and mean would be pointing out everyone on reddit is wasting their life and should just kill themselves pointing out someone is stupid is not mean its a public service
OldSchoolCool,removed,actually he says muslim inbreeding may be the cause not islam seeing as you probably say the exact same thing about rednecks all you have proven is your reading comprehension is utter shit also i dont see him posting in raltright scientifically proven that jews are the smartest race therefore superior muslims howeverquite low on the iq spectrum probably because it is custom to marry and procreate with first cousins and he actually is a truther so that clearly proves he is a liberal still doesnt disprove being an inside job the fact is those buildings fell at free fall speed meaning every single load bearing anything all failed at the exact same time to the point in which there was absolutely no resistance to the fall that simply isnt possible without a controlled demolition also building fucking have you guys not seen dark secrets inside bohemian grove the people that run this show are weird as shit dont put anything past them more liberal posts planned parenthood was founded by margaret sanger and george prescott bush to kill black people pick up a copy of ol margarets autobiography she writes all about it since the founding of planned parenthood more black people have been aborted than have been born
OldSchoolCool,removed,islamphobe isnt a real you cant have a phobia against a rational fear its like saying youre a cancerphobe also using that as an insult prevent anyone from criticizing religion not too mention its probably the biggest double standard in the world today christianphobe isnt even a word but i guarantee everyone who uses the word islamophobe is one sounds like youre the bigot are you intolerant towards trump because of his opinions
OldSchoolCool,removed,you really should add the s some people are stupid especially liberals and would want to believe you are right
OldSchoolCool,removed,that isnt irony i didnt say i didnt call people names i said they were salty butthurt name callers and as a liberal i have no problem insulting people that call themselves liberal but have the intelligence of a bag of dicks with no handle irony the expression of ones meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite typically for humorous or emphatic effect
OldSchoolCool,removed,very good point considering how much modern muslim countries hate jews hell hitler got ideas on how to treat the jews from the muslim countries at the time
OldSchoolCool,removed,

OldSchoolCool,removed,this is because a picture posted by a person who wants the world to see how attractive their immediate relatives arewere carries so many creepypervy implications inandofitself that nothing more needs to be said oedipus and electra already command the stage so it would only detract from the perviness to spoil their incestuous performance

OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,kill anyone who supports trump in public not saying its a good idea but no doubt it would change the tenor of this countrys dialogue
OldSchoolCool,removed,absolutely but his prior actions dont grant blanket immunity from criticism he shouldnt have called trump illegitimate everything else up until that point was fine but the simple fact is that trump won the election fairly absent vote rigging and ballot tampering to claim he is illegitimate is to attack the election system not the candidate and comes across as sour grapes if someone says something stupid they can and frankly should be called out for saying it regardless of who they are or what they have done in the past
OldSchoolCool,removed,i bet you are all for the clinton foundation though
OldSchoolCool,removed,trump won get over it enjoy it daddy trump is in charge now all of your leftist achievements will be quickly undone i will be here to be brigaded the whole way but enjoy every second of it maybe some of you will decide you cant handle it and kill yourselves which would be outstanding

OldSchoolCool,removed,are they not arrested all the time im confused whats your argument
OldSchoolCool,removed,we cannot and must not as a society return to a time where it is generally acceptable to treat a person differently due to the color of their skin were already there its super hip to be racist against white people now
OldSchoolCool,removed,but were the only ones talking about big boy things like dealing with the extreme levels of black crime while the big boy table is circle jerking to civil rights stories that have the veracity of hand up dont shoot still not sure what your argument is
OldSchoolCool,removed,i see and just out of curiosity how would one apply to be part of this supposed ring asking for a friend
OldSchoolCool,removed,lol ill donate to the united negro college fund right now if you can find any white areas with a higher violent crime rate than any predominately black area the poorest white counties in wv and ky are safer than the wealthiest black areas of southern ca or the dc suburbs cmon man i know you can do it some little jungle bunny is relying on you for the opportunity to take the spot of a more deserving white or asian student so she can flunk remedial math

OldSchoolCool,removed,what if anything the left is the one thats constantly being triggered i never see people drop casual insults about a president like people do with trump any question on askreddit always has that one douchebag talking about trump and dont even forget the racism this sexism that misogyny here bigotry there you could write a dr seuss book on that kind of bullshit obama was a great president and we shouldve had another years of him lol the economy is stagnant under obama he won the nobel peace prize and then proceeded to be the only president to be at war for the entirety of his two presidential terms his afa is poorly implemented and even people who would support universal health coverage arent entirely behind it he talked about transparency and then when actual transparency came in edward snowden and julian assange he pursued them for committing treason or just blamed things on russia rather than preach accountability for the actions of the democrats the democrats are in the worst position in almost a century as far as political sway goes that really shows how bad obama was sure hillary mightve been bad for president but it hardly explains the senate and house hates trump people are triggered cause its seriously annoying how sore losers the left are if my presidential candidate lost i would just stfu instead of finding ways to inject him into every conversation and insult him talking about the weather some douchebag will try to make a trump joke or insult him in some way if thats not triggered than i dont know what is ive never seen people shove their political opinions in your face like the left have this last election cycle for the record im libertarian and very moderate according to political quizzes ive taken i wanted kerry in obama in and didnt care too much in i wanted trump in so its not like im a lifelong right winger

OldSchoolCool,removed,the point i was trying to make was that this little boy and his family might have obtained the chimpanzee with no direct connection to its mother being lost chimps can feud cannibalize and nature can be cruel with sickness or hunger an orphan chimp is not implausible yes your bushmeat scenario is far more likely but even on top of that its hardly their fault like if i adopt a dog at my pound who was bred in a puppy mill am i responsible for the actions of the puppy mill should people wish harm on me because of i have a puppy from a mill also to be fair to those people below who want a monkey its both a blessing and a curse that they want a pet chimpanzee an animal being desirable like a panda makes it easy to rally people for conservation efforts the cost is that people with enough resources and not enough common sense actually obtain these creatures

OldSchoolCool,removed,today many times companies are forced to hire people incapable of doing jobs because of this very idea ive experienced it first hand on many occasions
OldSchoolCool,removed,the regressive left want to go back to this
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh come off it black are portrayed better in movies than they behave irl
OldSchoolCool,removed,any evidence he was racially discriminated and not random race baiting he could be an alchoolic or someone fired for drugsviolencecrimecontraband etc his anecdotes i wold say are not enough to determine a judgement in this case if anything blm has showed that race baiting can work
OldSchoolCool,removed,playing devil adovocate statistically arent black people more dangerous
OldSchoolCool,removed,using surely the way he did is something ive never seen from a black dude anywhere around my age its all fake words and raps with these guys now
OldSchoolCool,removed,back when black people were fighting for inclusion rather than separation
OldSchoolCool,removed,right yes i remember last week when my workplace stopped a negroe from applying
OldSchoolCool,removed,maybe he should have taken a break from complaining and got a job somewhere else
OldSchoolCool,removed,you sound just like my friend who always insists im racist goddam jap he is
OldSchoolCool,removed,black people should have delivered the chocolate milk
OldSchoolCool,removed,bs
OldSchoolCool,removed,this is how they protested before cop killing became a thing
OldSchoolCool,removed,see black lives matter people this is what actual oppression is
OldSchoolCool,removed,black culture needs to change if they dont want to be portrayed as thugs kind of like alcoholics they need to see that they are the problem before it can be fixed
OldSchoolCool,removed,the resulting poverty and segregation is a direct result of shite black culture its not cool to hold a job or speak proper english black kids are handed everything they get first pick on job applications a bonus sat score because theyre black etc etc white people have done them a huge diservice in the sense that we still treat them differently thats been the whole problem with white guilt is that its just as racist and damaging weve taught black youth that theyve been victims all this time not to take their culture and community into their own hands and actually contribute to society so now weve got shit heads both white and black behind the blm movement just making a mockery of what their grand fathers fought for black people are no different than white people fundamentally but modern black culture is just as racist and disparaging as joehickbilly was back in the and
OldSchoolCool,removed,why isnt that negroid picking cotton
OldSchoolCool,removed,erhm the scary thing is how badly you like that muslim cock down your throat
OldSchoolCool,removed,hey you pulled that black cock out of your mouth good for you have a cucky day
OldSchoolCool,removed,visit any major city and hang out with a group of black people theyre not hard to find they dont have jobs
OldSchoolCool,removed,typical jap always laughing at things
OldSchoolCool,removed,media and entertainment need to change not to be a dick but if black people are more dangerous than white people on average its not the medias fault how about we work with the lowincome areas rather than expect media to change no need to force media to change and make all thugs white when the majority of thugs people encounter are not black media will adapt
OldSchoolCool,removed,you are a jihadi you live in a shithole in the middle east you like getting your brainwashed islamic buddies and flooding into countries like mine to undermine them and prepare them for eventual sharia law closing borders will solve everything and every muslim maggot like yourself who tries to enter this beautiful country should be jailed for at least months and harshly interrogated so we dont get fucks like the german train axeman you have been poisoning america for years with your violent religion and hatred for infidels and probably forged your citizenship documents the actual scary thing is jihadi terrorists like yourself think you arent the equivalent of an invasive species wreaking havoc on this once great country and of course we would love to enlist and destroy terrorists but the fuckwits in charge of our government have unamerican values hopefully someday you grow up and realize that youre a brainwashed worm who means nothing in a civil and modern society but until then people will hate you for your support and endorsement of terrorism
OldSchoolCool,removed,anecdotal but the statistics reality support my position but handwave it away and call me racist if it makes you feel better my best friend growing up was black but i lost him to heroine addiction i still run into his mom occasionally at the store sweet woman master gardener too if you dont think black culture in america is bad go hang with the blm crowd and if you still dont think there is anything wrong here then you are probably part of the problem
OldSchoolCool,removed,nuking mecca would benefit the entire world lol
OldSchoolCool,removed,seems like you fit right in there why poison my country america is a place where you can do and believe whatever you want unless it hurts others like you muslim filth your beliefs mean nothing to me because youre a filthy arab who will never respect my country or denounce the violent cult that he clings to
OldSchoolCool,removed,not in my neighborhood they cant
OldSchoolCool,removed,doesnt matter you dont belong here freedom of religion stops where violence starts you cant call that thing of yours a religion its a cult youre free to believe in religions that dont hurt people but you have no constitutionally guaranteed right to oppress and violate others which is why we cannot continue allowing fools like yourself to believe that eastern hate propaganda news flash buddy there is no allah and there arent any virgins because religion is a fairy tale but you retards take it seriously enough to kill over if my political stance is trolling to you maybe you should study up on the problems facing america today you know from the cave you share with ahmed
OldSchoolCool,removed,hey hey all lives matter
OldSchoolCool,removed,no you must be awfully far to the left then as in two muslim cocks at once
OldSchoolCool,removed,see american women dont want the negro touchin their milk
OldSchoolCool,removed,culture is wholly different than the race you belong to and yes popular black culture as popularized music and television is disastrously poisonous to society white and black if you dont think after decades of black youth listening to rap lyrics about their role models singing kill whitey isnt racist and part of popular black culture itself then you are just being cognitively dissonant
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont think every black person participates in that culture so i guess im not racist good glad i got that across i base my assumption that someone is jobless when they are collecting welfare checks when they have every opportunity to work bro who says i fear black culture im just saying that encouraging criminal activity in popular music and film and treating black people differently than white people thanks to white guilt read special treatment has been a major contributing problem of perceived racial disparity in the nation weve raised an entire generation of black youth to be victims
OldSchoolCool,removed,wow i didnt know they had any books besides the quran in your shithole
OldSchoolCool,removed,surely it happens to white people top it just never makes the news because blm has an agenda
OldSchoolCool,removed,civil rights was such a huge mistake black people arent fit for modern society
OldSchoolCool,removed,wanna cracker parrot
OldSchoolCool,removed,what oppression i dont see any
OldSchoolCool,removed,storefront is reasonable compared to ring wing redditfags
OldSchoolCool,removed,not at all everyone is racist racist people are scum therefore everyone is scum this is the problem with simply saying racist people are scum of the earth its the same as saying people are scum of the earth

OldSchoolCool,removed,i took it first and then dished it out and for the record youre right about reddits userbase i just figured id say something that triggered you too what with your parents saying it to you as a teenager and all
OldSchoolCool,removed,black people wish so desperately that america were like this again without oppression they really have nothing
OldSchoolCool,removed,haha as a black person you condone the killing of police and support known criminals like trayvon martin and mike brown all the while pretending to be oppressed
OldSchoolCool,removed,hey man white jobs matter too
OldSchoolCool,removed,fuck blacklivesmatter does that make me reciiisstt naw
OldSchoolCool,removed,what is that jay zs grand pappy if he wasnt able to deliver milk in america why could he not go deliver milk in liberia

OldSchoolCool,removed,oh get aids lol
OldSchoolCool,removed,the reason you are where you are now is because you are the asshats when you insult and shame people like you are right now they will not become part of your movement you insult the person not the idea whereas the altright attacks the idea and not the person one gains new people through convincing them the other pisses off people because of how they treat them and by doing what you are now insulting people based on their ideas you are furthering your own problem i sincerely hope you realize this as your ideas deserve a chance you are denying them
OldSchoolCool,removed,feminisms definition is the advancement of women and female causes it says nowhere that you believe in equality otherwise you would be an egalitarian
OldSchoolCool,removed,so tumbler bitches have been around for awhile i see
OldSchoolCool,removed,agreed i fucking hate when people think men and women should have equal rights the fact that we are biologically unequal supports the notion that we shouldnt be treated equally it really flies in the face of nature
OldSchoolCool,removed,twat not the most appropriate term in this context
OldSchoolCool,removed,i can handle it thats why im here you pansy i just dont think you should run around and call people fascists when its not accurate you regressive fuck
OldSchoolCool,removed,every ideology has its idiots and they are attacking the idea of megyn kellys book not her herself beyond this there will obviously be times when they focus on other things then ideas but are they insulting her or are they insulting her ideas ask yourself that and then realize the difference between insulting ideas and insulting the person the difference between calling someone a racist because they disagree with you and considering someone an enemy because they spout falsehoods are not equivalent actions one is shaming the other is confrontation of the ideas
OldSchoolCool,removed,as if my name or character changes the definition of a word
OldSchoolCool,removed,yes but you come off an idiot when you focus on the person and not the idea you can change peoples views however you cannot insult and beat them up into changing peoples views if you want people to deny racism you have to first focus on why racism is wrong which it is then treat them like a human you will never convince someone they are wrong when you call them sub humans or insult your way to victory or the end of the conversation whether or not they deserve that respect or chance is up to you but i am warning you you will not accomplish anything by shaming people as it makes them marauders and not change their views for example i could be sitting here telling you you are an idiot for thinking shaming people is acceptable im not because if i did you would either become stubborn in your views ignore my words or resent joining my idea all three are not good outcomes and will in the end only retract value from my ideology you can paint a racist as not racist but until you truly talk about it without shaming him into his position he will only look not a racist but inside he will still hold the same views and eventually those views will rise out of the space they were hidden in
OldSchoolCool,removed,not exactly calling us nazis is like saying all muslims are terrorists because they have abnormal amounts of terrorists most racists would probably consider the altright but not all or even close to half of all altrighters are racist or nazis for example look at milo an openly gay alt right spokesman who is a coal burner by his own admission he only dates blacks this man is the biggest spokesman of the altright
OldSchoolCool,removed,lol id never rape a woman especially when nowadays they suck your dick for free i dont see a point in it no white americans should be scared of black people get it right of black population and of every crime is done by blacks soyeah btw in you called me sexist because i thought you are female i just want to let you know that people like you are the easiest targets for people like me so thank you for that
OldSchoolCool,removed,you say you instead of alt right and yet you wonder why i say what i say your reply is a walking contradiction to us being the ones attacking people
OldSchoolCool,removed,you will never get someone to drop their ideas by insulting them
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,a nazi who fucks black men take a step back and realize how absurd that sounds to call a gay already breaking the nazi rules black loving now race mixing man a nazi
OldSchoolCool,removed,while that is kinda enjoyable it was ops mom i did finger bang i wont name her name nor the place she lives but you rest assured i was knuckle deep insider her once i wanted to have sex with her but i liked her too much i was young and dumb and thought girls liked being liked turns out shes more into you not liking her then she chases you i got tired of that game fast ops mom is a cool chick if a bit crazy seriously though i was absolutely in love with her
OldSchoolCool,removed,unfortunately it is real i kinda freaked out when i saw her pic up on reddit though brought back a lot of badgood memories she was my first true love and deep down i still love her to this day she was cool as hell and a freak my brother fingered her first he knew i liked her but he was a playboy type and she was all about the hot guy with muscles i was the ugly skinny funny guy she eventually allowed inside her after figuring out my bro was just looks and no brains im not writing this to upset op but it really is a small world
OldSchoolCool,removed,my wifes great uncle was lt don garrison a pilot mia on over the finschafen area it was his combat mission this is the narration of the events on that dayfrom on sept the fighter squadron scored on of its greatest aerial victories of the war twelve planes of the squadrons patrol were covering the landing operations at finschafen when enemy bombers and fighters came to attack the invasion convoy the squadrons pilots led by captain frederick a harris went into action swiftly capt harris led the first flight of four aircraft in a diving attack on the enemy fighters hoping to scatter them so that the other two flights could attack the bombers unmolested the maneuver worked of the bombers were shot down and of the fighters were destroyed only two and one pilot lieutenant donald a garrison were lost for that mission the received a commendation from brigadier general paul wurtsmith commanding general of fifth fighter command
OldSchoolCool,removed,well the left and everyone else hasnt even tried to reason with them what have they been called for the last two years racists white nationalists nazis people okay to kill etc all the while having the mainstream press and establishment against them and at times censoring them twitter purge and hillary calling them deplorable among people saying its okay to kill them i mean put yourselves in their shoes and see how willing you would be to concede to the other side knowing if you did you would be mocked for eternity about it and made fun of like a beaten dog youve tried everything youve thrown every single thing and then the sink at them racism calls to kill them firing them from their jobs censoring them intimidating them doxxing them ad infinitum but the one thing you have not tried is treating them with respect and reasoning with them even now you talk down to them by saying they are too ignorant to realize the other side you must realize you have tried everything but the most obvious option treating them with respect and as humans thats the entire reason their movement has got this far as people see them as maurters when they see them being censored intimidated harassed reputation killed doxed and fired for their views even your fellow brethren on the left have moved more right due to this behavior yet it continues you are in a loop right now your attitude of not giving them any respect and being so ridiculous to them created them and every time you do it more they get stronger and when they get stronger you do it more and when they get even stronger you continue not to compare them to nazis but since you think they are lets look at the nazis got power by people feeling bad for them the entire reason hitler took power was the reichstag and if it was not burned down and the nazis were treated better no one would feel bad for them and all they would be is some party without much power
OldSchoolCool,removed,you missed the entire point are you actually this dumb i hope for the world you are either kidding or messing with me
OldSchoolCool,removed,i dont give a shit this is not for me it is for you my ideology controls congress executive judicial state i am winning whatever you call this do you think im telling you for the fun of it are you actually that dumb i am trying to help you keep your ideology and not make a fool of yourself ive already won for the next four years and my ideology is about to win austria and france talk shit i could care less but when you look back at how trump took power and how we won you can blame your own stupidity and refusal to listen

OldSchoolCool,removed,sometimes i wake up in bed and wonder if theres any point in getting up out of bed if theres any reason for me to roll out of bed and if anything would change in the clockwork universe if i sat there in bed staring at the unpainted nighthawk model that i bought at castle air force base when i went to aviation camp when i was nine put together and never painted bland unpainted grey formmolded plastic hanging above my bed listening to my mother watching jimmy fallon clips on youtube on her phone in the other room and laughing in a way that sounds like she doesnt want to laugh but has to because she knows its good for her like the laughing is vitamin drink that tastes bad that she doesnt want to take but does anyway because she has stage pancreatic cancer and probably isnt going to live much longer anyway but still takes vitamins because that small shred of hope is the only reason she herself gets up in the morning and i lie there wondering if therere any lucky charms left or if shes eating the last bowl of them right now while i lie there thinking about breakfast and trying to muster some enthusiasm for eating something manufactured and sweet and failing but knowing inside that i will eventually regardless of how i feel because im not an individual with agency driven by reason but a biological automaton driven by imperatives beyond my control and my wondering whether i should get up in the morning isnt a real question but rather a masturbatory exercise in selfcontrol and awareness that will i know will not end well im supposed to go to the dentist this afternoon my mother made an appointment for me to see dentist chang this afternoon but she knows i wont go and i know she knows i wont go on account of my social anxiety which is still crippling and which im certain youre all tired of hearing about like there goes bradley with his social anxiety again why doesnt he just get over it and get outside i do go outside with my burqa but unfortunately i cant go to the dentist in a burqa because they cant work on my teeth through the facemask id cut a hole but that would ruin it make it useful only for dentist visits it would be my dental burqa which is one thing i dont want or need why bother with teeth the first thing my grandfather stopped doing when he got alzheimers was stop brushing his teeth which makes me think that taking care of your teeth isnt like a vital integral part of being a modern human but rather something society expects and encourages think about it we have dentures and implants we have technology that makes dental care obsolete a toothless person can get by just fine in the modern era of blenders and vitamin drinks so why do i bother well i personally dont bother whats dentist chang going to tell me that i dont already know that my teeth hurt yes im aware they hurt i dont need a dental mirror to see that theyre riddled with cavities and caries and caked with several years of tartar and plaque is he going to fix them he might remove them but he wont fix them because even working triple shifts at taco bell mother doesnt make enough to pay for real actual insurance and the government knows the truth that we have the technology to circumvent the necessity of teeth dentures and pudding and vitamin drinks and etc so they dont pay for anything but removal which i can do myself and have done myself with pliers and aspirin in front of the bathroom mirror over the sink to catch the blood i drop the rotten teeth one by one into the sink and they clatter surgically around the porcelain basin and i wipe everything down really well so mother wont know how resourceful her dear boy is

OldSchoolCool,removed,hi i read your link you provided and i have also read your comments above why so black and white i could say the same about you i did not bother to look at your responses to other threads because that should not matter too bad you probably are actually a extremely committed troll or else why do you think in those terms and what a clever nonresponse diversion tactic good job marginalizing me or the import of what i reported i am either crazy or an agent of chaoswow heavy contribution too bad reddit is only useful for these dorts of lame brained back and forths if i would have phrased everything differently i would have gotten differnt responses i should have said dear reddit i was raised for politics and then told to stay away what should i do with my life and then you would have had a whole new comment just as useless but instead we should ensure that communcation stays open and pigeon holing someone calling names categorizing etc is how you shut down debate by trying to discredit me it is a management tool to characterize complainant as mentaly ill whether the complaint is medical legal personal etc that is usa management
OldSchoolCool,removed,can you explain the sovereign citizen thing it is a word phrase that cancels itself out it is physically impossible to be a sovereign citizen so no you did not figure out my motivation or anything i think you are trying to steer the readers into pigeon holing me so that they do not wonder about the legal implications of using the zip code and what price they may now be liable for their receipt of a government benefit

OldSchoolCool,removed,dear reddit bernie sanders would have bankrupted the fucking nation and sold your children into a communist totalitarian shithole world i know you like free stuff who doesnt but unfortunately free stuff is not a real concept there are only so many resources to go around spreading them out evenly only ensures that everybody stays fucking destitute oh well except for the people at the very top who are running things like you know bernie sanders would have been if he got in by the way reddit just because i know the downvotes are sure to roll in i just want to take this opportunity to point that youre all about a bunch of atleastsemiautistic losers who have spent the majority of your lives in an airconditioned room staring at a book or computer and have never gone outside and experienced the world the real world and no i dont mean that summer you volunteered for a conservation organization or the time you spent in the peace corp i mean the real fucking world where people starve and murder eachother for food shelter and anything else they need but you know dorky autistic commonlystrickenwithhealthproblems redditors have it all figured out of course

OldSchoolCool,removed,real ones exist the same way crimes against trump supporters are real but there is a very undeniable tendency on the left to portray oneself as a victim and you see these people faking hate crimes you dont really see people faking crimes against them on the right and making themselves out to be victims there are isolated cases from time to time but its just nowhere near the same endemic levels as it is on the left

OldSchoolCool,removed,theres an art behind makeup called contouring which yes does change facial structure look again at that first photo thats zooey deschanel notice how much more angular her face looks because when she does the pixie girl theres a lot more eye shadow bangs curls and contouring to make her face look rounder that second photograph is lisa marie presley who also looks nothing like marilyn monroe their actual facial contours are completely different this particular makeup job was done by kevyn aucoin who was known for his genius at contouring he had an entire book of beforeafter with celebrities he had made look like different people purely through contouring and hairstyling if you compared jennifer lawrence and helen mirren without makeup youd see very different faces heres as close as i can find to an older with as little makeup as possible or neutral makeup on mirren she doesnt look like jennifer lawrence at all the eyes are very different and what makes them similar is lawrences use of shadow im married to a woman who plays around a lot with very subtle contouring changes sometimes she looks like kate winslet other times she looks like scarlett johansson those two look nothing alike and the only difference is slight changes in contouring heres another of how one can change facial structural appearance purely via contouring

OldSchoolCool,removed,nice result there retard looks just like i said it would
OldSchoolCool,removed,right being jewish has never been coool
OldSchoolCool,removed,we have such a morbid obsession with the holocaust because weve been social conditioned by zionistcontrolled media i dont see the other historic genocides popping up on the frontpage with the frequency of the holocaust
OldSchoolCool,removed,daily holocaust reminder goyim
OldSchoolCool,removed,proof the holocaust never happened and hitler was the start of only good things for these people
OldSchoolCool,removed,daily reminder holocaust the post
OldSchoolCool,removed,oy vey goyim all these pictures are real remember the trillion

OldSchoolCool,removed,million jews newspapers oh hello holocaust people
OldSchoolCool,removed,have the kikes slaughtered a bunch of palistinians again usually when they wheel out the propaganda
OldSchoolCool,removed,wow you have no idea what you are talking about lol go travel and see the world before you run your arrogant mouth about things you clearly know nothing about reading palestinian propaganda on the internet doesnt make you a scholar
OldSchoolCool,removed,death train
OldSchoolCool,removed,that doesnt make a lick of sense surely we would be more inclined to focus on the injustice of genocides where the culprits werent held responsible no but were brainwashed with the holocaust while all other genocides are nothing more than a footnote if that
OldSchoolCool,removed,have you ever seen it it is as i described it its dumb ineffiecent and costly and the amount of people per day that would be gassed and later burned is simply impossible and those newspapers about million jews proves that smth is fucked up
OldSchoolCool,removed,you realize the holocaust happened because of the myth of zionist control right international jewry had already declared a war on the german government staging protest rallies and worldwide boycotting of german goods which was before any statesponsored persecution against jews historians conveniently omit this little detail when demonizing the nazis as genocidal monsters
OldSchoolCool,removed,girl on the right looks so fuckable
OldSchoolCool,removed,oy vey dont question the six gorillion

OldSchoolCool,removed,and for good reason now the us is down to white from the jews are pushing and pushing for more mass invasions of nonwhites trying to decimate the white people amazing how of the population can control everyone httpthezoginfolistsummaries
OldSchoolCool,removed,this isnt a picture of jews were is all their pennies and their noses are nowhere near big enough must be slavs or homosexuals
OldSchoolCool,removed,white people in general are disgusting
OldSchoolCool,removed,yes auschwitz is a large place but that doesnt take away the fact that a day is minutes and the allies claim that the germans have gassed people a day its literally impossible to do that in auschwitz carring out the bodies and cremation of hours takes time keeping a fire in a massgrave alive in polish winter in the fucking impossible and they wont spend the money to do that they have been freaking digging around that area and cant find jackshit and besides why the fuck would they do the most expensive and timeconsuming way of murdering these jewish people why not put them all on a row infront of a massgrave put a knife into their neck and move on gassing is stupid and germans are by no means stupid and cant afford gassing people during wartime people who died died due to starvation because of the war and typhus other diseases zyklon b was used to disinfect clothes from typhus that was spreading over the camps thats a fact that its used for those kind of causes cant you explain the reason by having doorhandles inside the gaschambers the woodendoor to the chamber the air leaking windows the brickbuilding and the lightbulb in the ceiling purpose this instead of talking about nonsense and made up bullshit times lower like get outta here with that nonsense if you put people in a fucking room you gotta use shitton of zyklon b its just how it is and one snap on that freaking lightswitch and the place explodes thats just how it is man it makes no sense and how do you know they tried to destroy evidence because the allies said so lol the winners write and create history also what is the reason of this chimney why would the allies create such a thing after the war hmm i do wonder

OldSchoolCool,removed,there is nothing racist about wanting a strong military low taxes keeping jobs in america protecting gun rights and keeping savage muslim animals out of the country
OldSchoolCool,removed,of course prowhite is bad problack is good
OldSchoolCool,removed,ok so i have a question for you when you see something that is prowhite does translate to antiblack because a lot of problack people or ideas are antiwhite when people talk about prowhite ideas they are talking about things like better education for poor white people promoting access to voting rights and other egalitarian principles the term problack has only ever been associated with racism such as black panthers and blm and killing white people or other things like that so when a person says that the concept of problack ideals should be accepted because prowhite ideals are too thats a disingenuous thing to say because one of them wants to actively subjugate a class of people while the other wants fair and equal treatment two similar phrases but vastly different underlying motivations

OldSchoolCool,removed,i have a nazi propaganda magazine my uncle brought back from the war it shows a smiling hitler playing with a puppy this is what a lot of people do not understand there are different sides to most people ill bet there is a photo some where of mother teresa kicking a dog
OldSchoolCool,removed,jesus motherfucking christ the amount of people attempting to justify rape is well i wanna say its too high but just one is one too many for fucks sake loo at yourself in the mirror and say it out loud raping women is ok if you still can keep looking at yourself then please make humanity a solid and blow your brains out

OldSchoolCool,removed,jew serious i did nazi that coming
OldSchoolCool,removed,nazis were animal lovers and had very progressive protections for nature and the creatures in it some people trace the beginning of young adolphs arc of descent to something that happened to him as he was shipping off the front on someone stole his little dog who was his best friend and constant companion in the trenches
OldSchoolCool,removed,haha utrumpropriation gets boners from this type of thing ð
OldSchoolCool,removed,its illustrative of how dangerous nationalism ethnicism etc are you under the impression that the people who fought the germans were not also ethnic nationalists do you know anything about americas immigration laws or england or france etc ethnic nationalism was the default setting for all people and still is the default setting everywhere but the west and hows that working out for us no english soldier fought in wwii so that their granddaughter might one day be raped in rotherham by pakistani immigrants no frenchman would have dug a trench had he been told he was fighting to turn france into somalia and neither of my grandfathers fought to turn the us into mexico stop projecting your disgusting globalist views backwards into history wwii was a power struggle which was like any other war a struggle for land and resources with each side pumping out its own propaganda to get the troops going no one declared war on the germans because they were racist good lord if the only lesson you learned from wwii is that we must be ashamed of ourselves and let our childrens future be stripped away by third worlds hordes then i pity you youll gain nothing and the war you think youre avoiding is the war youve now guaranteed
OldSchoolCool,removed,comment is so meta i would rate perfect
OldSchoolCool,removed,i made a new sub because im sick of roldshcoolcool being brigaded by fucking nazis roldschoolnonazis i know nothing about running subreddits and its empty but its there if youre interested in helping im all for it
OldSchoolCool,removed,let me remake the argument which has just been disassembled well done and for the record the germans have not been destroyed theyre now the largest economy in europe and a thriving civilization because anyone can recover from war or economic woes but no one comes back from demographic displacement just ask the bantu or the ainu or the inuit or the american indian or the tibetans etc as usual you watch the right hand while the left peels the skin from your bones your children may grow up as a hated displaced minority in their own country but hey at least you virtue signaled against nationalism on the internet now thats what i call forward thinking
OldSchoolCool,removed,ask the jews about nationalism israel is an unapologetically nationalist state they openly declare themselves a jewish nation and have some of the strictest immigration laws on earth so what point exactly are you trying to make if your point is wow nationalism gassed the jews in germany again im not sure what to say to you nationalism did not gas the jews in fact as i already stated the allies were all nationalist states themselves and they saved the jews in other words nationalism is not a guarantee of good or evil it is simply a state of being and a necessary state for any people who wish to endure it really is a pity what your head has been filled with in regards to history i must add i think the great irony of your post is that the jews formed their own heavily nationalist state because of what happened to them you see the jews who you used as an example knew better than anyone how dangerous it is to let yourself be made a minority in any country especially an overachieving minority and yet you somehow see the lesson of the jews in germany as being we should make our own children minorities in our own countries good lord how can you miss the point so entirely you know how the people who actually experienced the holocaust responded to it they became strict nationalists and discovered the importance of having a nation state in which ones own people can be the majority and determine their own future which is exactly what i advocate for all peoples including yes whites and exactly what you fight against now that is the definition of irony
OldSchoolCool,removed,france isnt somalia the us isnt mexico and plenty of dutch people rape people too not just the immigrants do you have the slightest idea of what demographic trends are
OldSchoolCool,removed,a passionate argument you were doing so well except for one thing nationalistic countries did not save the jews no one saved the jews no one cared about the jews and in fact in the end they were just another weapon the us england and russia used against germany this is pure pedantry a a great deal of jewish refugees were taken in by other countries even if some were denied at first b by defeating germany the allies did save the jews within the camps whether or not you think this was a priority it is a fact that they were saved no matter what you imagine the underlying motivation to be and it is a fact that not a single nation that fought nazi germany had any of the antiwhite antiborder views pouring out of the other side also the case of germany in wwii was a case fanatic nationalism not something to be proud of but rather something to learn from germany could have won wwii if not for its fanatical world view there would not be a poland anything can become fanatical this is not an argument against nationalism merely against human nature arguing that nazi germany is evidence that you can never again have borders and an identity is like arguing that dr gosnell is evidence that you can never have abortions spare me i ask you now to look up the warsaw uprising a beautiful and tragic example of nationalism those patriots died for nothing during that long fight just as many patriots died for nothing during wwi remember to be a patriot is not the same as a nationalist ive never had a taste for playing word games the word patriot has far too many connotations and largely refers in modern times to a love for country which is why i avoid it nationalism comes from the word nation which has always meant birth origin and a shared ancestry the patriot swears allegiance to dirt and flags the nationalist to people i understand from history and biology that demographics are destiny which is why i understand that defending the idea of a nation while displacing the people who created it is an exercise in futility if we exchanged the populations of switzerland and somalia overnight we both know how each would look in the morning it is people who create beauty and peace and high standards of living not magical dirt if you cant defend a peoples right to exist as a majority within their own nation you cant defend anything i wont say nationalism is wrong or right it is both nationalism is something to be recognized for what it is drag it out into the sun and let the people of a nation see it clearly perhaps pointless wars could be averted that way perhaps the insane death toll of wwi and its continuation wwii can forever be avoided blaming nationalism for these wars is absurd is it nationalism which causes the sunni to kill the shia is it nationalism which causes the protestants to kill the catholics was it nationalism which caused the holodmor how did nationalism cause maos red army to exterminate his own people war is a complex and terrible thing disagreements cause war religion causes war ideology causes war greed causes war globalism causes war saying if it werent for nationalism no bad things would happen is to declare yourself a desert of human understanding and now as we see all over europe it is not nationalism which is causing conflict but the lack of it compare the ethnic and cultural clashes in france or sweden or belgium to those in poland or hungary and tell me who is closer to war the truth is that diversity proximity conflict and always has in their desire to destroy fanatical nationalism the left has simply guaranteed its return the people feel under threat as they should and the slow drum of nationalism is beating once more in the european heart and its sad to me because all the left had to do was leave things alone europe was getting along fine were forming a closer union and the lessons of wwii had been learned but they overcompensated they decided to flood every western nation on earth with alien peoples and cultures and now western people will have to fight if they want any sort of future for their children we speak about the fanatical nationalism of the nazis but we are living through the fanatical egalitarianism of the marxists and it will end the same the pendulum seems to swing always too far to one side please respond to this im only a few beers in and the night is young i have to head out for a few hours but im sure youll have something for me when i get back
OldSchoolCool,removed,what you mean how hispanic people are going to outnumber white people in years in the us there isnt going to be a us in years just balkanization will that be a bad thing are hispanic people inferior to white people were the ainu inferior the tibetans the american indians the inuits the bantu its not a question of inferior or superior its the question of people having the right to exist as a majority within their own nations and raise their children accordingly was it a bad thing when all those people were displaced in their own nations i think so thus will it be a bad thing if whites let it happen yes i think so if you dont youre probably a racist if yes youre a racist and wrong if no you have no argument come back to me when you want to have a discussion rather than an excuse to answer your own questions
OldSchoolCool,removed,thats not a demographic trend
OldSchoolCool,removed,exactly people forget that he didnt just sit in dark corners rubbing his hands together and muttering jews to himself he was a human being with good sides too

OldSchoolCool,removed,christ are you really this dense i understand what youre trying to say but what you said suggests that you didnt understand what i said let me walk you through this very slowly so you can get it look at her picture again do you see that big natural bush i think its very womanly as opposed to the clean shaven look popular today which to me suggests prepubescence you see that little patch of hair emerges after puberty and is therefore associated with womanhood while the bare mound is associated with a child during the it was uncommon for women to shave their pubic hair hence when women were women do you understand now or are you just too fucking stupid to realize that man isnt the only category to which a female might belong if not woman

OldSchoolCool,removed,selfhating leftists get hardcore triggered every time someone mentions it but theres an undeniable correlation between the amount of power held by whites and the quality of life enjoyed by the population of the places they govern it takes a uniquely delusional individual to assess the history of africa and come away with the belief that africans are better off governing themselves

OldSchoolCool,removed,youre right but intention has no value to most sjws they are bullies deluded in their belief that fighting oppression requires censoring and insulting those who disagree sometimes over something as simple as a word ie gasp pronouns they are toxic to the touch taking up too much fucking space in media and social forums especially those who call themselves beautiful while their heart works overtimeinsanity my point is that it takes away from concerns that impact nearly everyone im talking infrastructure on a national scale baby let us work together to get those bridges up to code and those pesky potholes filledpaved byahhh also i think those two groovy gals rock those afros with both grace and gusto you didnt have to read all this tldr fuck bullies of all shapes sizes colour or creed although staunch feminists who always swing their dicks around with fanatical fervor do have a special place in my heart to get all so many a dem bridges up to code people potholes too

OldSchoolCool,removed,you clearly dont know how to get an african american down from a tree do you
OldSchoolCool,removed,why do blacks hate blacks so much is the real question my mammie always said no one will love you until you love yourself maybe thats the issue
OldSchoolCool,removed,especially white people thanks for heaping the blame on me because of my skin colour you generalizing piece of shit
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,what is it with blacks and loving communism you know one of the reasons these people have been supposedly historically disenfranchised is because they refuse to simply pledge their loyalty to the us like everyone else and be on our team they throw their lot in with the communists any chance they get and so now were moving toward a socialist state these people lack the mental fortitude to be free look at what they have done to their own homeland this asshole holding this sign should be thanking his lucky stars that his ancestors were taken from the dark continent so he could live in a first world nation you know in africa they have street mobs that burn you alive for stealing potatoes did you know slavery was still legal in parts of there until and continues to be a massive problem today where though it is technically illegal it is still practiced out in the open reddit autists communism is different from muh socialism i dont care get your sippee cup and take it elsewhere pls
OldSchoolCool,removed,japan rules korea chinese civil war while also at war in the second sinojapanese war japan invaded the philippines korea split into north and south korea korean war you guys are still beefing
OldSchoolCool,removed,asian people are the most racist against blacks than any other race and its not close
OldSchoolCool,removed,what are you talking about name me one country in africa that is in good shape the entire continent is a wreck muhammed ali himself famous for his black power and black separatism sentiments once famously remarked after getting off of a plane and visiting africa thank god my granddaddy got on that boat black americans overwhelming vote democrat of african american women voted for hillary clinton in the last election about of the men did too theres no fucking question these people simply do not have what it takes to remain free look at the cities they infest here in the united states even wealthy cities park viewwindsor hills is the most wealthy black city in the nation with a median income of and their violent crime rate is still through the roof the only one who didnt provide any evidence here is you same as how it always goes on reddit i make real and thoughtful comments pointing out real facts and realities that people dont want to face and then some snot nosed kids come around and go wah wah no ur the stoopid doody man whatever dude some of us actually want to be intellectually honest with our assessments of the world some of us actually want to know whats up with things
OldSchoolCool,removed,classic black people bringing up race when it nothing to do with it and the vietnamese would have called them racial slurs if they had met
OldSchoolCool,removed,communism voting democrat genius yeah it does democrats are socialists and socialism is only the first step to communism the people at the top who fund democrats have universally openly written about their communist vision of the world theres no denying it maybe youre just someone who is too blind to see the truth the same way the african americans are generalizing about crime in black communities while ignoring the history of blacks in the us is willful ignorance but for you well settle for plain old ignorance nope slavery ended long ago jim crow laws were not that widespread in fact they only meaningfully existed in a handful of states and where they did they almost universally applied equally to whites the provision of the law was separate but equal and in practice thats how most facilities were we only here about the rare occasions where they were not and the rational for segregation was nothing that devious it was the exact same rational that is used to today to justify safe spaces and black only field trips events on college campuses it was considered cruel to send black children to learn in a racially charged atmosphere where they had to learn their history from a white perspective and in the many many states where there were no jim crow laws or where segregation was even specifically outlawed since the blacks never faired any better socially in the whole of new england for example there was no segregation past the if your hypothesis was true then blacks in those areas would be thriving but they never did you understand that there were black senators in the right they could live work hold public office and white electorates were willing to appoint them they were not as disenfranchised as youre pretending theres nothing to excuse their failure in modern society especially when you consider that they travelled a historically easy road compared to other groups in the world during the century russia had stalin lenin the holodomor china had mao japan had two nuclear bombs dropped on them japanese americans interred in camps jews were put in camps europe was decimated by two world wars all of the infrastructure was leveled and families watched their children lay dying in the streets million dead from largely civilians europe rebuilt japan rebuilt russia rebuilt now youre suggesting that blacks have carte blanche to commit crime be an economic drain on us and threaten our freedom and sovereignty through their political will because they had to drink from a different water fountain sounds like youve been drinking a little too much of societys koolaid fuck off
OldSchoolCool,removed,so were just going to ignore that there is almost unemployment among black youth and systematic poverty in black communities they are only unemployed because whitey is keeping them down i mean look how successful african countries are predominately black nations are utopias
OldSchoolCool,removed,and years later blacks are rioting in south central burning down korean and vietnamese shops a bit ironic is all yeah though no doubt vietnam war is a stain on americans history did however muhammad ali really say that though i thought that quote was fake maybe not
OldSchoolCool,removed,we are not equal stop spreading a lie
OldSchoolCool,removed,somebody further down was discussing which countries are on average most racistdefinition is shaky at best so let me try to answer it not the best methodology but hey its a start here are the results do not want a neighbor of another race india jordan do not want a neighbor of another race egypt saudi arabia iran vietnam indonesia s korea do not want a neighbor of another race france turkey bulgaria algeria morocco mali zambia thailand malaysia the philippines bangladesh hong kong i am gonna skip all the countries in the middle and go right down to the most tolerant bunch do not want a neighbor of another race norway usa canada brazil colombia sweden latvia australia new zealand guatemala argentina britain no surprises there to be honest i come from norway but now live in thailand which is ranked quite intolerantracist whats weird is that yes there has been discrimination here against me for being a foreigner and caucasian but on a whole ive not seen much of the so called intolerance here i wouldnt say society as a whole is racist against me or really all that discriminatory i wouldt call it institutionalstructural or anything like that its mostly just individuals being assholes in ways that dont effect my life too much a bit sure but i cant blame anything on it nor does it really hold me back sure dudes have wanted to start shit with me simply for being white and popular with their girls and some police arehave gonna stoped me over a native thai just so he can steal cash from me through intimidation and others of cases false arrests where cops plant drugs on you so you can bribe them which sucks dont get me wrong but it doesnt stop me from doing of what i want you learn to talk your way out of it though maybe not false arrests though lol how do i know its racismbigotry because its not nearly done to the same degree to asian tourists like japanese or chinese people regardless of wealth i guess for every japanese tourist the cops plant shit on european ones get that same treatment russians are treated no better despite barely having more money than thais nevermind japanese folks here is the source its the daily mail i know i know but its seriously the best article out there on this survey by far and the actual survey itselfthe link to it doesnt work so this is the best ive got thus far
OldSchoolCool,removed,asian people are the most racist against blacks than any other race and its not close is this the guy we are talking about because it does not say that all asian are racist is it okay to say they are racist vs more racist than i dont know and neither do i care not my strong suit really those kinds of debates my point was that asians measured as a group probablyalmost certainly are more racist than whites as a whole now if what i said just now is a stereotype then that words means nothing anymore and yes it should be okay but if we are talking about my first example then who knows the morality and ethics of it does not interest me much
OldSchoolCool,removed,that steep red roof is der weinerschnitzel actually their bbq bacon cheddar dogs were sublime back before the mainstream hotdog became a hair horn asshole product their country breakfast too as with almost everything anymore not so much upvotes for everybody im buyin the taco bell of my was in goleta by the airport straight walkup no roof
OldSchoolCool,removed,i do t think theyre cool wasnt this during the depression they look like the type to spit on the homeless
OldSchoolCool,removed,maybe its the crime ratesmaybe its the culturemaybe its the hypocrisy when it comes to racism maybe its the school gradeslow iq maybe its because of ghettos maybe its because blacks seem to destroy everywhere they go i dunno could be other things but those are some of the main reasons i think what do you think are the reasons
OldSchoolCool,removed,your parents are right
OldSchoolCool,removed,why would they its not as if blacks there need to be segregated for being so few in numbers but they do laugh at them for looking like baboons
OldSchoolCool,removed,slavery was abolished over years ago and even if they didnt have equal rights in the they do now and have for decades im done listening to this racist promoting the left does on a daily basis you people are the true racist for promoting this type of shit on a daily basis i want to see it die off but itll never happen because racism being dead is against the lefts narrative and they wouldnt have much without it
OldSchoolCool,removed,shes smart blacks victimize asians more than any other race
OldSchoolCool,removed,racism is justified and truthful
OldSchoolCool,removed,nothing wrong with being racist
OldSchoolCool,removed,no korean ever tries to steal my stuff either
OldSchoolCool,removed,its because they dont speak english most asian countries have a large portion of the population that are very racist towards black people
OldSchoolCool,removed,youre incredibly ignorant
OldSchoolCool,removed,thats racist prejudice stereotyping hateful kill yourself
OldSchoolCool,removed,lmao how do you say dumb shit like that with a straight face
OldSchoolCool,removed,literally anyone can be and is pulled out of line by the tsa or followed by police stop making everything out to be about race its like im the only black person who doesnt do this racist shit
OldSchoolCool,removed,its funny how when it comes to something like this someones personal experience applies to all peoplebut if i say my family was killed by a muslim and now i hate all muslims youd all me ignorant stop giving racist black people a pass to be racist youre making things worse not better
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah i literally just stated that im black just because you get pulled out of lie or stopped doesnt mean its about race stop making everything about race youre making things worse not better thanks for the unprovoked insult we all know that when youre right about something you have to resort to insults
OldSchoolCool,removed,are you really so dense that you cant comprehend what was said hating all muslims because one killed your family is an emotional reaction not a logical one just like assuming everything that happens to you is because of your race fucking idiot seriously think for once
OldSchoolCool,removed,what
OldSchoolCool,removed,is english not your first language or something how are you having any kind of difficulty understanding those simple sentences i dont have the desire to walk you through this so do your very best to think critically
OldSchoolCool,removed,just because youre incapable of comprehending what someone says doesnt mean that what they said was incoherent nice attampt at scape goatting though youre bad at this
OldSchoolCool,removed,it was an example to make a point youre so dense
OldSchoolCool,removed,whats more likely that im not making sense or that a couple of stupid and angry people refuse to accept what was said which is something that append hundreds of thousands of times a day
OldSchoolCool,removed,clearly a troll
OldSchoolCool,removed,youre choosing to infer what you want instead of thinking logically because the latter means youd have to concede im suggesting that assuming everything that happens to you only happens to you because of your race is ignorant i was making the comparison between the two because theyre both ridiculous to think youre too fucking stupid to understand that simple point though apparently fucking idiot
OldSchoolCool,removed,grandfather looks like jim halpert mixed w white obama
OldSchoolCool,removed,i love when retards argue with themselves about something they imagined was said
OldSchoolCool,removed,thats probably because youre retarded as proven by what you said next i dont hate muslims i was quite obviously making a simple point im black nice try though
OldSchoolCool,removed,lmao youre definitely and objectively retarded thanks

OldSchoolCool,removed,theres no proof ops mum even loved his dad sure he walked her five miles home but did she walk him home no romance is just men loving women and not getting any love in return and yet people still seem to think its beautiful
OldSchoolCool,removed,fucking typical why is it always men who do these grand romantic gestures ive never heard of a woman do something like this for a man fucking never it seems like women are incapable of loving a man at all they never show affection or show it
OldSchoolCool,removed,how is it cute its sad its a perfect example of how men never receive any love from their girlfriends or wives its all give for us i bet ops mum never did any romantic gestures for him
OldSchoolCool,removed,if she were my mom id break both arms
OldSchoolCool,removed,what do you mean have you ever heard of a woman make a grand romantic gesture for a man like ops dad no women never do anything for their partners this post is just more proof of how unloving and unromantic women are and how men always have to give the love in relationships
OldSchoolCool,removed,i would walk miles to bang ops mom too
OldSchoolCool,removed,i would
OldSchoolCool,removed,eva mendes lol thats like comparing a dodge to a ferrari except for the fact they are both cars they have nothing in common walking miles wasnt a big deal back then like its today the actual effort was to keep your hands at home and wait for sex for months you know back then women had more respect for themselves and men had to really work for a kiss or more
OldSchoolCool,removed,i would run through your mom like a cornerback tried to tackle bo jackson
OldSchoolCool,removed,id drag my dick through miles of glass to walk her home
OldSchoolCool,removed,bet she took some mean facials back in her day

OldSchoolCool,removed,better than what hes paid to wear nowadays
OldSchoolCool,removed,i mean you do have to admit it it though saying turks are a race and not a nationality does kind of prove you are maybe a little inferior to the rest of humankind you gotta agree maybe it actually wouldnt be such a terrible thing to put you guys in internment camps and have you labor for the benefit of all civilized and non subhuman people funny thing is you probably cant come up with a rational rebuttal to this because you know your true nature a tool for advanced and civilized peoples to use and then toss away
OldSchoolCool,removed,complete shit compared to how nazi prisoners were treated in the united states
OldSchoolCool,removed,you turks really are the stain of humanity and the collective shame of the civilized world huh unbelievable

OldSchoolCool,removed,it was a freak accident you fool
OldSchoolCool,removed,lol this is garbage this bot sucks why do people like this shit
OldSchoolCool,removed,so many military propaganda on reddit so your grandfather was a colonizer in hawaii the scum that was raping and brutalizing the native hawaiians too bad the japanese didnt drop a bomb on his head
OldSchoolCool,removed,a native hawaiian should have drowned him years ago you grandfather was scum
OldSchoolCool,removed,why
OldSchoolCool,removed,maybe im native hawaiian and thinks people like ops dad should have been gassed in auswhitzch
OldSchoolCool,removed,yep a babe too bad the curtains probably matched the drapes both in color and length ill upvote ya though because motley crue on the fridge

OldSchoolCool,removed,not likely my grandfather was a man who was quick to anger his philosophy was to hit first and ask questions later he was from a small town in italy and he earned himself the nickname martello or the hammer here are some example of the acts he committed he was a shepherd as a young boy in italy in the and he once stoned some local teenagers who tried to steal his heard while in his or so i was told he got into a fist fight with a catholic priest the priest came over to the house to tell him he needed to donate more during sundays mass he didnt take too kindly to that in his late he badly injured a man who tried to break into his duplex my grandfather heard some noise at the back door he took his crutches his right leg was amputated earlier in his life walked to the back of the house and opened the door he saw it was his upstairs tenants boyfriend who was trying to break in he smashed his crutch over the guys head and stabbed him with the pointy end so while i concede that your grandfather was more handsome than mine i guarantee that it would of ended badly if he even looked at my grandmother in a suggestive manner

OldSchoolCool,removed,and communist faggot is the appropriate term for someone who sympathized with stalin and his regime and if you knew anything about history youd know that the original nazi plan was just to deport all the undesirables to madagascar that only changed because himmler realized the war was going to be lost relatively soon so technically if we sided with the nazis the million that died in the camps wouldnt have and the million that communism killed over the century wouldnt have died either

OldSchoolCool,removed,if you had any respect you wouldnt be using a vague image of a random person with a sob story attached to get reddit sympathy points
OldSchoolCool,removed,calling out stuff like this serves no purpose other than making yourself feel superior based on what i hereby announce the obvious that i am not superior to anyone or anything morally psychologically or physically worst case youre being downright disrespectful to a real living person with a tragic story billions are living a story just as tragic right now where is their reddit post best case well done you enjoy the sense of smugness my dick your ear

OldSchoolCool,removed,more like scarlett jewhansson

OldSchoolCool,removed,oh my god boo hoo all you people ever do is act like victims if jews werent literally infiltrating and destroying societies from the inside out they probably wouldnt have been thrown out of nearly every country in the world throughout history or led into camps by germans in

OldSchoolCool,removed,oy vey remember the six trillion
OldSchoolCool,removed,muh six gazillion
OldSchoolCool,removed,what concentration camp did your grandmother attend looks like she couldve been a good worker and an even better lover the reason i ask is because my great grandfather worked as one of those camps as well im german by blood japanese by choice hes been dead for quite a few years but after his wife died he would always tell this story about a beautiful wench he fell in love with while he was stationed their love was forbidden since he was a high ranking official but they met in secret the women he spoke of was inexplicably lost after her husband was killed for refusing to let his son work in one of the chemical plants they had on the premises they were forced to meet at night in secluded places once they were caught and my grandfather had to crack her in the skull with the butt of his gun to save both their skins anyways i digress my point is a lot of the nazi officers get a bad rep for the war crimes and all but there are plenty of beautiful stories which illustrate the humanness of these nazi soldiers just some food for thought
OldSchoolCool,removed,hot damn i wish i were your granddad op
OldSchoolCool,removed,what are you a fucking jew because thats cool
OldSchoolCool,removed,your grandmother got so much aryan dick i wish i could just sign up for a german grindr work camp and take aryan shlong for a long weekend

OldSchoolCool,removed,ops grandmother specifically really isnt the crux of the greater issue in discussion in this thread however it should be noted that the poles were a people literally at war with germany and the germans were occupying their country at the time not exactly hard to understand why they didnt exactly get excellent treatment httpwwwwintersonnenwendecomscriptoriumenglisharchivesarticleswrsynopsishtml

OldSchoolCool,removed,there was no holocaust
OldSchoolCool,removed,they only promote their own if youre a halfway talented jew youll get a hundred times more opportunities than gentiles it is what it is
OldSchoolCool,removed,and shes hot
OldSchoolCool,removed,no no no you see the hoiocaust belongs to the jews no one else is welcome to that sweet sweet victim karma
OldSchoolCool,removed,sounds like something to be proud of phaggot
OldSchoolCool,removed,how anyone can live in the world today and even with a total absence of knowledge of politics at the time and the historical context of german persecution of jews during which i recognize the overwhelming number of people who partake in these discussion do not have and not realize that they simply had it coming is beyond me look around you look at your corporations look at your bankers look at your media and your academics who constantly lie to you and bend facts and testimony to their will in order to manipulate and subvert you and your offspring in order to bring you one step closer to total dependency and obsolescence look into their religious doctrines look into their actual beliefs take a look around you at their communities these people present a very real threat to you and your offspring to your future on this planet im a white person and i love the white race i dont want to see it die out however the jewish people present a threat to all races and creeds that are divergent from their own any living and breathing person on this planet should understand why the germans did what they did in to say nothing of the argument that there probably never was any conspiracy to actually murder them all anyhow merely to keep them held in camps during wartime just as the us did to japanese citizens living here during the war
OldSchoolCool,removed,would
OldSchoolCool,removed,colorizebot
OldSchoolCool,removed,damn i would have fucked that mousy little jewess hard if i was an ss officer

OldSchoolCool,removed,yay more never ending holohoax threads my grandfather was gassed times the polish as well seem very attched to the holocult brings in shekels to pay for the lands they stole from germany
OldSchoolCool,removed,theyre worth less than fecal matter
OldSchoolCool,removed,you underestimate the soft and spoiledness of the average redditor the things that trigger young people today is pretty hilarious
OldSchoolCool,removed,work camps run by germans were equivalent to star hotels jews lie about this to gain sympathy
OldSchoolCool,removed,its good she found a job in germany as a woman
OldSchoolCool,removed,
OldSchoolCool,removed,whatd she work on probably a visual basic programmer i bet she liked being dominated by krauts

OldSchoolCool,removed,its almost like the story didnt add up and this is just more boo hoo my ancestors were victims of the big bad mean germans propaganda we always hear
OldSchoolCool,removed,you dont show anybody pictures of a government conspiracy to eliminate jews they dont exist what exist are pictures of jews in concentration camps which sometimes had bad conditions disease lack of food supplies especially during the latter days of the war this is the same as showing you pictures of japanese citizens in us internment camps during yes we locked up all the japanese within our borders during the conflict and saying look there the japanese holocaust proof

OldSchoolCool,removed,obesity confirmed
OldSchoolCool,removed,her body is sexually attractive regardless of what age she is nothing wrong with admitting that
OldSchoolCool,removed,its not our fault youre gay
OldSchoolCool,removed,its pretty insane if you took a picture of a naked girls body every day of her life laid them out sequentially without revealing the age and then asked adult men to pick the youngest looking body they find attractive and would have sex with most would probably point to one taken when she was or years old reveal the ages though and the results change people basically lie and repress how they feel to conform to social norms

OldSchoolCool,removed,while the five women worked on eniac they developed subroutines nesting and other fundamental programming techniques and arguably invented the discipline of programming digital computers bartiks programming partner on the eniac was betty holberton together they created the master program for the eniac and led the ballistics programming group the team also learned to physically modify the machine moving switches and rerouting cables in order to program it in addition to performing the original ballistic trajectories they were hired to compute they soon became operators on the los alamos nuclear calculations and generally expanded the programming repertoire of the machine and they had to figure it out by themselves with no manual to rely on the group reviewed diagrams of the device interviewed the engineers who had built it and used this information to teach themselves the skills they needed initially they were not allowed to see the eniacs hardware at all since it was still classified and they had not received security clearance they had to learn how to program the machine solely through studying schematic diagrams the fivewoman team were also not initially given space to work together so they found places to work where they could in abandoned classrooms and fraternity houses definitely sounds like a customer service employee httpsenwikipediaorgwikijeanbartik

OldSchoolCool,removed,you can say its a dislike in myself but me not liking people who hook up with every living thing and all they do is drinkparty is my own opinion its a degenerate lifestyle cause they dont aim for anything in life just partying every single fucking day also most people like that have some sort of dyed hair and in general act like fucking idiots the same ones who see buzzfeed post something about trump that isnt true and without reading it or reading the other side defend it to their deaths social justice warriors and feminists the shit ones are ruining all the progressiveness weve had youre damn fucking wrong its not my concern it is my concern all people my age like to do is complain they dont make enough money because they work full time at a starbucks and believe they deserve fucking its sickening and im fucking tired of it the little party rats dont know what real hard work is and dont know how youre supposed to properly live im fucking happy with myself im not doing what they are ive been to edc i was in cali for weeks ive been to new york ive been to washington dc i party here and there and have my fucking fun but i also sit my ass down and work a hard fucking career to be able to afford a apartment in the suburbs around vancouver and guess what at im almost able to afford the downpayment even though ive spent so much travelling bought a car etc im super happy with myself ill dislike who i want when i want because that lifestyle is toxic and for degenerates if you want to be pc and accepting of it thats your choice but i can confidently say its not also regarding your in the street comment i have many gay friends who are successful as fuck they dont go whoring around and partying all the time speak properly and dont dye their hair and get stupid ass tattoos and piercings everywhere aka a normal fucking person who is homosexual however i hate faggots who talk like idiots act like whores even worse than female whores think they can talk down to you and if you talk back they throw the you hate me cause im gay card so fuck people like that fuck people like that they are bad for society on the bright side they work shitty jobs all their life i came from the middleeast and my family was living in tough fucking times growing up in canada thanks to the government and welfare they helped us get on our feet and now both my parents have done great and have a good property and live healthy lifestyles meanwhile these pieces of shit teens growing up in canada complain they dont make enough money hell i fucking show them how much money i make and recruit them and they go no i dont wanna do that so if they arent willing to work hard or go out of their comfort zone why the fuck are they complaining about not being able to afford a nice place so seriously fuck you if you support a degenerate lifestyle ive seen hell and had a chance to get out of it and i took it say whatever you like but most gays ive met working dt dont even care about having a good job or anything they party all the time and always hit on me to come out and shit with them and when i said no thanks some would get offended regardless if youre gay or not i dont support a degenerate lifestyle if that triggers you good maybe you should think harder

OldSchoolCool,removed,perhaps a different part of paris or maybe theyve cleaned up since heres another vid showing the migrants too an heres a story on it proof of paris garbage
OldSchoolCool,removed,so is it currently like that right now have you been around that area and nearby
OldSchoolCool,removed,yes most migrants which are supposedly from syria are in fact not this is due to most of them coming for welfare reasons or perhaps more arguablycontroversially for the western women or to spread islam rather than because they were in a state of war and had their life threatened im glad your experience has not been particularly negative unfortunately i posted paints a different picture i quote the conditions are absolutely devastating the police have given up trying to control these areas the remaining french people avoid the areas at all cost crime and rape is rampant just recently mass brawls and riots made the news as fights broke out near the stalingrad metro station

OldSchoolCool,removed,not sure why youre getting downvoted
OldSchoolCool,removed,disgusting negger
OldSchoolCool,removed,try for
OldSchoolCool,removed,would bang
OldSchoolCool,removed,not sure what your point is as the article actually quotes him saying these are preliminary results the small sample of young women is not representative of the entire population â that would require something like subjects its hardly being dishonest as you imply where all of the subjects are currently under the age of yes because after this age other factors come into play child birth ageing heres more httpwwwcbsnewscomnewsfrenchstudysuggestsyoungerwomenshouldstopwearingbras one lone study is not concrete scientific evidence it is something that prompts more study yes think we covered that already nobody is arguing against this another study with better controls one day could entirely debunk it and prove it to be a load of crap it could be the next big scientific discovery in womens research so by your rationale one study that disagrees with these findings would be enough evidence for you to confirm your beliefs and be the next big scientific discovery in womens research but the study that conflicts with your beliefs is garbage ok
OldSchoolCool,removed,it sounds like is saying that you using the original study to say that women used to have better boobs because they didnt wear bras is garbage not that the actual study is garbage i actually didnt say that i said probably because as in this might be the reason you know didnt expect a shitstorm to follow perhaps a debatediscussion with links to studies contradicting the french study would have been nice instead of anecdotal evidence and opinions from people clearly upset by these findings however your fellow canadian friend is actually saying the study is garbage thats very clear there is currently no concrete longterm scientific link between wearing a bra and having perkier breasts i believe the hypothesis was the opposite but your statement is correct interpreting the study to absolutely mean that is actually just bad science but that isnt what the study or the interpretation said
OldSchoolCool,removed,its interesting that in a thread so deeply buried that ubuddytheelfblue who posts in rvancouverisland suddenly and attempts to support you meanwhile youve also posted about quite the coincidence isnt it also strange how in a thread so deeply buried that my posts are immediately downvoted by multiple accounts you wouldnt happen to know anything about that would you

children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored even with the same socioeconomic upbringing the racial iq gap remains the minnesota transracial adoption study examined the iq test scores of black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families the aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on iq tests as compared to white children the studies general findings were that the iqs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending

OldSchoolCool,removed,sorry about your ugly grandparents
OldSchoolCool,removed,so again your only response to hard data and empirical study is to cry shadow conspiracy and advance vague untestable notions and excuses for black failure in society as far as the historical argument blacks have had it easier than most of the groups in the world europe was fucking decimated by two world wars in the century their economy and infrastructure was destroyed and million people died japan was hit by two nuclear fucking bombs today its an economic force to be reckoned with jews were nearly eliminated off the face of the planet today theyre surviving and thriving and are the single most economically successful cultural group on the planet blacks had to drink from a different water fountain fuck your fake historical narrative of undue oppression and especially harsh circumstances life has been hard for all of us the survivors rise up and rebuild whats been taken from them after years of charity and special treatment the black community in the us has failed to do that to even one shred of a degree they are as bad off now as they have ever been and people like you continue to make irrational biased excuses for them

OldSchoolCool,removed,move goalposts much your argument was basically that people shouldnt have a right to free speech of what they say is offensive or it preaches violence against others this picture is of a man holding a flag while an older woman assaults him is preaching violence worse than violence itself are you not preaching violence by advocating violence against someone whose opinion is obviously one of which you do not approve ie assaulting a person is ok if they are naziskinheadkkk let that sink in for a minute the point im trying to make is that free speech is a right afforded to everyone as long as it is nonviolent in the manner in which it is performed

OldSchoolCool,removed,fuck off you filthy communist scum your type ruined eastern europe for hundreds of years you disgusting parasitic shitstain theres no term low enough for commie trash they all deserve to get shot on sight
OldSchoolCool,removed,wow just like that you invalidated everything cited in that article
OldSchoolCool,removed,italian antifascist
OldSchoolCool,removed,you always will end dead on the streets choking on your own blood or hanged where people will see your dead body i like you a quick death is too good for a fascist you guys were born in the rcringe molded by it you sound like weenies
OldSchoolCool,removed,its clear to me that this wont be received well but i cant help but wonder if the difference in opinions here is a lack of nuance and cultural differences between europeans and americans when someone says antifa to a european most are going to think of modern antifa groups not the classic ones modern day important emphasis antifa in europe are fucking scumbag thugs who mostly commit mob violence on old people from religious parties antiabortion monarchist parties or yes sometimes actual racist groups the perception i get from americans is that they think these groups are like freedom fighters or something nowadays its not anymore most antifa shitheads are kids from rough backgrounds with substance issues trying to find a moral way to engage in random violence and theft
OldSchoolCool,removed,nothing wrong with nationalism certainly better than globalism all governments are authoritarian moot point corporatism suggests globalism not nationalism
OldSchoolCool,removed,you always will end dead on the streets choking on your own blood or hanged where people will see your dead body lol such a chode
OldSchoolCool,removed,si si spaghetti
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh okay well if thats thr game were playing then anything from nyt cnn huffpo or politifact are out of bounds and if you post an article from any of those sources or sources similar to them then you automatically forfeit the argument see now we can both make up rules about what sources are permissible and the best part is we never have to refute anything the other says
OldSchoolCool,removed,having trouble answering that itself answers my question
OldSchoolCool,removed,right because past comments of you saying the right wing is all scum totally leads me to believe that you would support anyone else in this election
OldSchoolCool,removed,you are advocating for bigotry
OldSchoolCool,removed,which massacres do you prefer the ones or the current ones
OldSchoolCool,removed,you guys dont like watching other guys fuck your wife pussies
OldSchoolCool,removed,every form of government has led to that
OldSchoolCool,removed,haha hes stalling
OldSchoolCool,removed,before spouting off nonsense google the massacres made by the nazi fascist in italy and pick which massacres and genocide you prefer the ones the nazis committed or the ones the leftists invite the islamists to commit do you suppose nazi europe would have issues with overwhelming immigration by parasitic predatory barbarians which genocide did you choose

OldSchoolCool,removed,oh i already knew you were a racist but i appreciate the confirmation what wasnt clear was that you were also a polygenist i suppose the idea that we are acually a singular species wouldnt conform with your shite supremecist ideals so it makes sense that you would align yourself with nazi ideology and pseudoscience i get it you want things to be one way but theyre the other way and reality has a way of asserting itself as obama would say please continue

OldSchoolCool,removed,does anybody else have a face that gets compared to an animal even a tenth as often as sjp gets compared to horse is that person compared to an animal with particularly nonhuman features the closest i can remember is a set of pictures of george w bush and chimps that made the rounds a decade ago but that wasnt nearly as prolific or longlasting as sjphorse comparisons and gwb really was making similar faces to the chimps and chimps actually have faces pretty close to humans anyway in this case the proposed candidates for an explanation are i swear this is a common thing except it is never this common and never this nonsensical or its some stupid nonsense joke that doesnt really make sense but still gets repeated like many other stupid nonsense jokes the second one makes much much much more sense

OldSchoolCool,removed,proud of what that he likes the d or is it something real like becoming a doctor no one cares if you suck dick what matters is if you are a good person
OldSchoolCool,removed,not sure what there is to be proud about
OldSchoolCool,removed,he is proud that his kid is unexpected why would he be proud of that pride is earning something not squirting something defective out of your dick maybe he can try harder next time when doing a sex that is how it works right
OldSchoolCool,removed,gay does not equate to love anymore than nongay does gay is a sexual choice not a love choice
OldSchoolCool,removed,proud of what lmfao
OldSchoolCool,removed,it isnt really anything to be proud of though like i get how its good that people arent actively discriminated against for their sexuality and whatnot but ive never understood the proudness thing its more of an unfortunate situation which prevents you from leading a normal fulfilling life in many ways annnnnnnnd then theres not much to it like its good in some ways because you dont have as much responsibility but there really isnt anything about it to be proud over like the human race would die out if we all just went gay you know im proud of my heterosexual parents who slaved and sacrificed in order to raise a child and do their part to secure the future of humanity am i proud of sucking a dick no not really its not really an act that you feel a whole lot of pride from go ahead and downvote heterogenous hivemind reddit i think youd be the same people who were scoffing at these outofthebox dissident thinkers in too
OldSchoolCool,removed,back before everyone became butthurt pansy assed sjws
OldSchoolCool,removed,disgusting
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah thats what i dont get i posted a comment similar and itll get downvoted cuz reddit only likes people who think what theyre supposed to think like i seriously never had my face drenched in some dudes jizz and after was like i hope mom and dad are proud of me for this i know the downvotes will roll in but i seriously dont see how any reasonable person can discount this logic
OldSchoolCool,removed,what a fucking cuck
OldSchoolCool,removed,im loving russia now

OldSchoolCool,removed,im ok being called an asshole by anyone whos proud of gayness its nothing to be proud of
OldSchoolCool,removed,oh they do but they dont treat severe psychological disorders with the same discretion you basically have to be rich to get medical like that in usa
OldSchoolCool,removed,thats what they tell you to get you fuckers to shut the fuck upgay men were coddled by a single mom lesbians were molested by daddyor other family memberssimple as that
OldSchoolCool,removed,this is great and all but nobody cares about depression every depressed people you have gay yet we all concentrate on the sexual deviant nobody cares about pedos but that is the same sexual deviancy according to dvsm and also we have pedos per gay
OldSchoolCool,removed,consent is not the issue just because people consent to something doesnt mean its acceptable aslo animals never consent to anything including being caged neutered and eaten so the issue of consent with animal sex is a mute point in fact it can be argued that sex with a lot less damaging than most things done to them people dont support animal sex because its intuitively wrong the same with homosexual activity its intuitively wrong
OldSchoolCool,removed,you would think of that queer cant think of anything but sex
OldSchoolCool,removed,whats wrong with my neck having a beard i identify as a year old gay bear how dare you discriminate against me you white nazi note this reply was sarcasm however can also be interpreted as legit because queers now have identities they can be
OldSchoolCool,removed,wasnt supposed to be funny its true awful person no its just dangerous to be right when the government is wrong all you queers serve purpose destablizing a society total tools used by someone else
OldSchoolCool,removed,looks fake what year is this if only the courts would go back to seeing gay as a mental disorder because thats exactly what it is stop treating it like some kind of race its a lifestyle preference brought up by mental instability you are either born a man or a woman and thats all youll ever be
OldSchoolCool,removed,myths ayy lmao youre saying that those poor little kids that get diddled by their uncles and then grow up to be gay were already gay by birth it really is only a coincidence you cant be that delusional
OldSchoolCool,removed,im not trying to insinuate that not all paedophiles are kiddy fiddlers either lots choose not to act on those thoughts my point was that the fact that god made gays isnt enough to say that god loves them god made paedos rapists and murderers too and depends on what you believe he certainly doesnt love those
OldSchoolCool,removed,bigotry ayy those meme words that are always used in cases like these a google search yeah nothing tells you proof like random articles
OldSchoolCool,removed,what exactly are you proud of the fact that your son has an uncontrollable desire to stick his penis into a mans dirty anus wow yeah id be proud
OldSchoolCool,removed,reported to redditru for gay propaganda
OldSchoolCool,removed,you cant prove that something like kids being abused and then growing up to be gay is a coincidence either its a subjective thing you can have your opinion and i can have mine theyre just opinions and are just as valid if you cant accept that then youre the bigot oh and btw bigÂ·otÂ·ry ËbiÉ¡ÉtrÄ noun intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself the difficulties of combating prejudice and bigotry youre the one that cant tolerate a different opinion
OldSchoolCool,removed,yea so he likes fucking guys int he ass why do i care

OldSchoolCool,removed,back when black people were fighting for inclusion rather than separation edit oh im sorry did i violate your safe space blm how is that racist exactly thats precisely what blm is doing they want black only spaces they go march the streets screaming for the death of police they interrupt public and private events to spew their propaganda a few of them have killed random police officers because police are racist and many have supported and congratulated the killers now tell how facts are racist
OldSchoolCool,removed,give a single legal inequality between races in the us because thats what this is about its not the white peoples fault that many black people are still in poverty im not saying its because they are black but im saying its their issue to solve not the white peoples the biggest problem i see is the high percentage of black children who grow up without a fatheraround i believe kids need a stable family to grow up to be good responsible people i know that i would of ended up a hooligan asshole if i didnt have a caring father growing up that is a massive issue to american black people that they need to fix themselves or you can just call me racist for thinking that black people should be responsible for their actions since its way easier to yell racist than it is to have a productive conversation
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah giving them free passes for government jobs and literally forcing people to hire them and accept them into schools despite being unqualified is definitely deliberately making them poor s
OldSchoolCool,removed,we used to have our safe space and hid in our little corner called coontown but now that its banned we hang out in defaults
OldSchoolCool,removed,yeah assholes leave the black guy alone its the jewish billionaires who are screwing this country look at any of the political donor lists versus population statistics
OldSchoolCool,removed,tie very tertiary studies about race and poverty to the thesis black people are more dangerous than white people what tertiary studies the violent crime rate for blacks is much higher than for whites thats just a simple fact it requires no tertiary studies its also true regardless of whether or not the ultimate cause is social or biological

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your considered mentally retarded right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jazz orchestra intro for as long as i can remember i wanted to be shagging your grandma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whenever i see old timey photos like this it always seems to be a really hot guy with what i perceive to be a really average girl beauty standards have changed quite a lot for women
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wait so who did the hanky panky she doesnt have a tan
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,some people for sure
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its weird that sometimes this bot makes some pretty great colorizations and other times is as racist as my great grandpa
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow colorizebot its already you shouldnt try to separate things into color classes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,after some hard analysis i tend to agree
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre a funny guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i know id go from rags to britches
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,make up theres a reason why its a billion dollar industry and why you cant tell if a girl is or
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that is because the concept of male attractiveness hasnt really changed much since then but the concept of female attractiveness has by a large amount
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think shes naturally gorgeousput her in modern makeup and youd be left speechless id humbly wager
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i see what youre saying and agree with you its not makeup lol you can tell natural beauty when you see it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that doesnt look like the most flattering picture of grandma either
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was in the kitchen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,let me explain the joke is that the only reason men have to go inside is sex even if we generously say that couples had sex as often then as they do now we can safely assume that grandpas were rather sundarkened traditional gender roles would account for grandmas paleness theres some jokes in there about kitchens or women only being allowed outside for sex but thats super low hanging fruit thats already fermented and turned into alcohol and i think its beneath us to pick it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,man you really do spend time on me really im flattered but maybe you should get a hobby
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,funny how funny like a clown am i here to amuse you to entertain you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would think it is more the pressure to be thin and look like supermodel thigh gap big ass big boobs but tiny waist i know a lot of women myself included who can take or leave make up but if you mention diets or how our legs look in shorts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,makeup existed back then though its just become a way of life nowadays like back then you only did yourself up for special occasions now you put a full face on before popping down to publix probably only applies to insecure girls though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know you said it how the fuck am i funny what the fuck is so funny about me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,supermodels dont usually have big asses and boobs but yeah
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so you mean to say that my girlfriend puts on make up because shes insecure and not because she enjoys it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i respectfully disagree back in those days you didnt leave the house looking disheveled or not put together its why old photos show everyone wearing fedoras even with bib overalls on in more rural settings you also saw the same attention to detail in male and female hairstyles everyone from upper class to blue collar made sure their hair was topnotch at all times its why there were barber and beauty shops on every corner in those days pomade has made a resurgence these days due to nostalgia but being able to leave petrolatum in your hair as a conditioning agent was as much about cost effectiveness as it was about aesthetic back then same goes for makeup my grandmother was a part of this particular generation in the photo and she would have never left the house without makeup applied or her hair looking its best never they carried that sunday best ideal throughout their every day lives much unlike modern times where its throw an outfit together barely comb or style your hair brush your teeth and out the door you go due to everything being in such a rush
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pm me and ill confirm for reddit by rating your similarity out of
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,get the fuck outta here tommy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i mean it is starting to be the beautiful body right to look somewhat like a kardashian the were about evacuated bodies and thing have changed if i go on pinterest all the girls look the same long hair tall big lips big breasts small waist big butt seemingly no cellulite they all start to look identical
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i meant supermodels specifically theyre for the most part pretty thin just because clothes usually fit that frame in a way that the fashion industry wants to showcase their clothes look at all the vs angels some of the top models of today not saying that society in general isnt into the frame you described
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a beautiful woman
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jeez how life can change so dramatically
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow amazing the photographer had an iphone back then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,get rid of that eyeliner and shed look pretty good
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,straight up fallout location there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that looks like the death star lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,op could have added a sculpture in belgium to the title and saved us all the googling but clearly op is a douche nozzle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sir douchesnozzle to you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn i was hoping it actually did something instead of looking pretty i guess thats also nice
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they look like eastern europeans squat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,very pretty
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,very pretty
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,touched up a littlehttpiimgurcomeprtroijpg added some
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she reminds me of someone i know very beautiful indeed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,such a beautiful cyster she was
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes a stunner
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,omg shes so beautiful
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,decent
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol im pretty sure she would have loved this comment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i bet she would i worked in a nursing home and the old ladies would always be propositioning people to fuck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,smash brothers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she sure was pretty looks a bit like gina rogers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,free cigarettes and all the bullets you care to fire good times
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your great uncle is bad ass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,people killing people isnt cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is this the model walt used to clean house with in that last episode
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wheres his monkey though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lieutenant dan anyone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,man vietnam is starting to be a distant memory
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,little man big gun
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he still lives his life this way years old
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he might look like a bad ass but that wasnt designed to make people look cool it was designed to blow holes through peoples rib cages
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no walt used the fictional model this model would have shaken loose from that juryrigged mount he used after the first couple of rounds the weighs about pounds to both help with cooling and to mitigate the recoil with the help of the bipod in front when placed on a mount though it needs to be a real mount engineered to the task not duct taped to a garage door opener also the odds of walt being able to get his hands on an even through the black market are extremely thin unlike semiautomatics which can fall through the cracks quite easily fully automatic weapons are heavily regulated in the us requiring a class license if you hold a class license every weapon you have must be accounted for and youre subject to unannounced visits by the atf to check on your inventory telling them that a weapon was stolen just doesnt fly because youre also required to secure those weapons also contrary to tv shows and movies machine guns are not in high demand by criminal organizations within the us because the use of one in a crime will more likely than not result in an atffbi task force to find the perpetrator and even if no one was killed youre still going to be looking at years in jail because you used a machine gun in the course of committing a crime in mexico its a different story where in some parts of the country the cartels are tooled up and willingly have shootouts with the cops sorry for the rant but that scene in the breaking bad finale just annoyed me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was looking for this comment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,edgy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nothing you mention is really impossible though is it theres no mention of how its mounted he could have bolted it to the bottom of the trunk he could have been using a industrial garage door opener like this httpwwwgaragacomgaragedooropenerscommercialliftmasterj and within the context of the show he totally could have gotten an on the black market or he could have gotten a semiautomatic with zero paperwork and converted it hes basically macgyver on that show so it doesnt break the rules of the universe that it takes place in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,official major combat operations started in if he was a babyface he could be or in this photo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there are no semi automatic the arc of fire and placement of those guys would have had to have been perfect for them to all receive instant lethal wounds that would have prevented them from pulling a pistol and terminating walt these were hardened guys who had been in shootouts yet none of them dived for cover once the shooting started its all kind of moot anyways in that universe walt and jesse would have joined hank and gomez in that hole todd and crew would have been very rich and they couldve ended the show by cutting to black
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,perhaps im mistaken on his age then i was going by my grandmothers age but i suppose hes a bit younger because in stories he left at
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats rad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why did he kill his dog and take a picture of it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we had that exact same ceramic jaguar on the fireplace while i was growing up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ill bite how cool was he
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not many people know that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she wont be laughing once it turns into cujo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its almost like hes saying to the camera yes i did both of them at the same time

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you must be like
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is it you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was that for sure looks more like the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is actually a very depressing photo my grandpa knows the baby my grandmother is carrying is not his but he is going to raise her anyway he also knows he is gay and he knows he will not be faithful to her in this regard terrifying thought but he was so so careful she doesnt love him but shes scared shitless and he pursued her for two months begging her to marry him and let him claim the baby as his my grandmother suspected my papa was gay and she told him countless times that she was okay with that and that they could just front as a family and live as friends but he kept denying it i feel like things could have been different had he just been truthful but it ended badly for everyone just sucks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thank you for sharing the good thing is that he was able to be true to himself there are still people who love their whole life pretending to be straight
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this photo is so heartbreaking and you can feel the pain that she was in thank you so much for sharing this photo and the backstory
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wait what happened tell us more
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was gonna say grammy looks stoned or sick after reading the backstory i think shes just scared sad story
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well my papa ended up leaving my granny for another man he had been having an affair with and it shattered her she never trusted or loved any man ever again and she wasvery bitter about everything like everything she hated all men and wanted everyone to know it even going so far as to try and sabatoge any relationship me my sister or my mother ever had seemed to get angry at anybodys happy marriages tried to mess me and my sister up sexually by saying how it hurt and was gross and men never cleaned down therethat kind of stuff the worst thing though was she became viciously outspoken against gay people causing me to lose multiple friends we fought endlessly about it she kept saying things on accident that led me to believe that deep down she had no problem with it at all and was just being spiteful for instance she had a friend that she worked with named james he was very obviously gay this was in a small town in the eighties and wellthey were not sparklefriendly one night they were out at a bar and some dudes started beating him in the parking lot my grandma went at them with a baseball bat she kept in her trunk she took him to the hospital he was like her son after my papa left she stopped talking to him he moved away i heard all this from my mom when i was sorry for the long reply but the more i think about it the sadder it gets
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she did puke that morning from nerves or ovenbun i cant say
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what do you mess by it ended badly for everyone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it kind of split my family down the middle we couldnt have family gatherings anymore because everyone always had to have their say i could tell my granny was embarrassed about the whole thing and maybe didnt want anybody to know about it but she was also mad enough that she never shut up about it either go figure something good came of it though me and my sister were pretty tolerant minded from an early age because it was explained to us very reasonably by our mother that papa loved a man instead of a woman and that was okay some men love men and some women love women and its normal so dont freak out when they kiss double points at christmas an extra grandpa granny was not happy but gritted her teeth and smiled
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i see i hope the best for your family
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thank you my little sister and her kiddo are thriving and thats all i could wish for
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,drum and bass

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,interesting factoid before ir remotes remotes would make a chime per button press and the tv would listen for the specific tone

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theyre all wearing costumes elvis toured looking as slick as possible
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for a solid second i thought it was flying

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so i assume your dad has a great personality
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the selfie stick in itself is nothing new the monopod has been around for almost as long as photography itself and has been used in the way your parents have for decades it just acquired the new name recently when manufacturers added other functions like bluetooth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy shit this made me feel old

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh my god your parents are adorable what do they look like now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad definitely married up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the funny thing is that without the date you could easily mistake this for a pair of hipster kids today who used some sort of instagram filter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn man your parents are adorable
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i see that jif back there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey thats my birthday well years early

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,old school cool goddamn reddit makes me feel old
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no offense to you or your parents but theres nothing cool about a selfie stick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it just invalidated the patent for it interesting
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,great pic but how is it an accident if they were deliberately trying to take the pic from a short distance with a modified stick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dads a dork
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,may they burn in hell for eternity
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks pretty intentional to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn i have this urge to watch harry potter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i bet they are expert selfie stick takers by now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the selfie stick is not a new or non obvious invention it was just useless before social media and camera phones if you didnt have an outlet to show off your photos then why would you want a close up of your face you would want yourself to be in the scene because you want to remember where you were
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we genxers invented a lot of cool things its just that most of us did not have a way to present it to the world there was no shark tank reddit or kickstarter because we had not yet invented those things boom
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,found the culprits ask them how they intend to make amends for all the slefiestick caused mayhem
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,adorable picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,visionaries
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad kinda looks like paul rust

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your parents were the basis for the fake marriage in the americans
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this looks like the people from the americans
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,omg that is so cute
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad is woody allen just fyi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did he previously invent microsoft dos
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hate to break to you but that is not a selfie stick your mom is holding
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,doesnt look accidental
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you needed skill back then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think they invented the selfie stick and the vintage effect

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that handwriting is almost identical to mine
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wtf how young are your parents
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ben dover
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but this is probably a camera sitting on a table or tripod or something and that stick is just to push the button right so its still a little different
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think the first use of the selfie stick was documented in google it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,got a current pic for comparison op
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my mother is on her last package for her polaroid camera sadly the chemicals arent holding up so they come pre yellowed just like ops picture

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ahh back when the wife took both the first and last name of the husband how times have changed

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i love it when people have these dorky pictures of their parents when theyre young it shows that they dont care how they looked because they love their parents and their parents love them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,inventing or just pushing the shutter with stick i mean did i invent the remote control when i was and used a stick to change my tv channel tv was broken and i got electrical discharges when changing channels true story have a picture of me with the tv

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpiimgurcomjppkrfvjpg
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,were your parents when they married
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your parents are super adorable
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there is nothing cool about this photo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the picture date is my birthday ð your parents look lovely
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,awwwh it looks like a lil mouse on your moms head
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is your dad the original nerd
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they seem too well dressed for it to be their clothes actually fit them and everything
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude was your dad stephen hawking
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,doxed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,am i the only one who thought she had a mouse or a gerbil on her head
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how old are they
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad is bill gates
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wonder if this can be used to invalidate some patents those companies have
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it doesnt look like an accident seems like she is intentionally pressing the camera with the stick to take a picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,most polaroids cameras didnt have self timers so maybe mum is jabbing at the shutter button
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it wasnt accidental they knew what they were doing when they attached a camera to a stick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they make look like ups for being ahead of your thing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if only she had it patented youd be sitting in a solid gold lambo getting your assistant to upload this to reddit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad looks like the guy at the payphone in dumb and dumber
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this picture looks like its from the i wonder if they were using really old polaroid film or something
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats the costco size box of otter pops
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not sure they invented it really
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and way back then strapping a camera on a stick probably just seemed irrelevant now they sell such a thing and its a big deal to a lot of people
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks like martha from the americans
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they look like such babies are they like i always forget how common it was to get married right out of highschool back in the day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,their wedding picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks intentional to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not a selfie stick theyre using the stick to push the shutter release button some models did allow a but im sure there are some simpler models that didnt have one as well as people just not bothering to get one if it didnt come with it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,many blessings to them may the live as long as they wish and love as long as they live
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey your parents first anniversary is my birthday i was born and the original selfie stick was created great day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad was punching fair play
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can i just say they oddly resemble clark and martha from the americans like down to the kitchen nook js
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how is this an accident it looks like they did it on purpose
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was a day old cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the bench warmers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,omg already looks like used to when i looked at old photos scary
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can we see what you look like i know thats kinda shady but i want to see how much you look like them loll
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your mom is ray donovans daughter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,clark and martha from the americans
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so your father is bran stark
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,inventors of selfie and selfie stick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she is holding her lovers cock while her husband shocks with surprise
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats actually pretty cool but cameras with timers didnt exist in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they looks like scientist o plus the big glasses physics
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and thats what life would have been like if i had invented the finglonger
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this doesnt look accidental
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad out kicked his coverage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad looks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i smellnerds
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the selfie stick holding the camera not just poking button was in while he was with minolta cameras
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,or a very long finger
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your parents are ugly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey thats my room
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to burst your bubble photographers have been taking self portraits like this since the invention of the camera its been done long before
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would so bang your mom
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jesus your parents were married in i was born that year how old are you am i too old for reddit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude this was taken in what kind of camera was used a kodak instamatic from

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it looks like she invented the thinglonger
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dad was ugly af
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,redact their names dick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it could be an ugly stick that your dad was beaten with
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,selfie stick was invented way before this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dads a fucking nerd
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did not look that old i was there it looked just like it does today even digital movies look old after a certain period of time and i cannot for the life of me figure out why that is as they should not degrade at all except for star wars that still looks crisp tight and on the money
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i see white people like were they ever exposed to sunlight
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i had the same thought op please tell us how old were your parents in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,funny that you mention that mom was and dad was when they got married and people always thought that dad was dating someone way younger and when my mother was a teacher and pregnant with our other brother they thought that she was a student even though she was hugely pregnant and that was fairly unusual
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lmao i was literally about to type your dad looks about in that picture still a balling photo though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his face looks young but his hair looks kind of grey
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i can see his wedgie from here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his dad kinda looks like harry caray to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,camera adds years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the tie knot is definitely a knot would of been at least three times larger
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the glasses and suit are trademark early though homeboy over there looking like a
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the slimfast can in the back belies that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,polaroid instant cameras had a bit of a revival in the early
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would say yeah but hes my dad ben and he was born in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,great year sheer heart attack came out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the basically were
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my parents accidentally inventing a vintage filter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dressing like the rolling stones
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it even looks like marthas apartment its crazy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i came here only to look for this comment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,everyone should check out the americans really great show
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was gonna ask if ops dad is a young woody allen but clarke and marsha pretty much nails it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpiimgurcomasrmblcjpg
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,martha looks genuinely happy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you made thisi made this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn that guys eyes scream amphetamines the must have been a wild time man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the fact that this is their anniversary makes it so much better
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,think they blew through that huge box of otter pops
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it looks as though dad out kicked the coverage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it looks like they just propped the camera against something and used the sick to push the button edit t
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lmao exactly what i was about to say op doesnt know the definition of accidentally
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,good news everyone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nope weve had some hard knocks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he looks to me like he helped writing dos source code
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey buddy you send this in a private message
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bingo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seems to me that anyone who meets them in person could easily know more about them in minutes than this picture tells ive never heard anyone not answer the question how long have you been married and the picture doesnt even have their first names written on it what exactly is it you think could happen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you saying shes out of his league no way hes hella cute they seem like a perfect couple
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes nerdy cute yes thats a thing sometimes we have thoughts of tying up guys and fucking their brains out not to creep out op or anything
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah my friend who is a girl just said he is really cute in my short life there is one thing i have learned is us guys all agree on what is attractive and what is not however some girls will think a guy is really attractive and then some girl will think that same guy is not attractive at all the variation is insane with girls i would love to hear some psychological explanation if any behind this idea from someone who is an expert as opposed to my drunken bar observations
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,idk ops dad looks pretty damn cute in this picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hed look fine without the big dad glasses
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,eight inches
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he gives me hope
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just goes to show men have been outkicking their coverage for a long time there is still hope for all you ugly bastards
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre probably not as old as many people on reddit think you are to the yr old redditor youre old if youve passed the age of if youre youre already over the hill even though youre still years away from even middle age i even see comments on rrateme where someone will say you look good for your age to someone whos

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,please dont be that person that thinks youre old because there are younger people on here and youre in your late
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to be fair they could have got married and had a baby the same year and you guys would be the same age
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like a polaroid to me the flash on those was hideous
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol damn
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they always look the same its your perception that changes its like playing some old ass game say half life for instance that you thought had realistic graphics back then just to realize it doesnt look as realistic nowadays
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre so right and in the everything was black and white you should hear the tales of my grandfather about when the world slowly crept into technicolor
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was when he was married so in this picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,or now we can math it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ye my dad had full grey hair by the time he was
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so a photo took today will look like new york will be amazed s serious topic on it do you think that applies for this day and age i guess its a phenomenon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wouldnt it have subtracted years in this case
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,except he looks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its probably a year old camera
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,may you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,would have
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wood half
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and the hair
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why did you say that name
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpiimgurcomtlmkbitgif httpiimgurcompxwrydugif
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what did they invent on their anniversary
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think it would be better if it was several years down the line like a year anniversary i need to know that they are still happy and dont resent each other after a long marriage movies and tv shows have taught me this is what happens
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its still a stick used for a selfie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so they invented the remote shutter release which already existed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,came here to say this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and used the sick to push the button i dont see vomit anywhere
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dont blame op he was an unknowningly child
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,evidently
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pretty long eh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,too late it has already been done
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youve been warnedget it heh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i mean youre right but it pretty clearly says the dudes first name
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres a difference between talking to one person in the real world and talking to thousands on the internet in the real world you probably wouldnt even talk to that one guy in the corner who has a reputation of being a creep but if you post personal information on the internet you dont really get the option to not talk to that guy its the difference between talking to someone in a private and making a speech to a room of thousands or more people
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it has his first name on it and ops username appears to be his real name
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah and shes how cool nerdy girls looked in not that shes not cute but i agree they look good together
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,keep going
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,us guys all agree on what is attractive and what is not are you avin a laugh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,swap guy and girl and the opposite is equally true this is pretty elementary honestly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,id love insight too although i cant provide it other than my own personal experience im super unattracted to buff dudes like the more swole the more im not into him at all not to say i hate muscles but ive always been into the skinny white boy emaciated rockstar kind of look i have plenty of friends who disagree and think the bigger the better in terms of shouldersmusclesetc only think i can think of to explain it is that male sexuality and female objectification are both more prevalent in our culture we have female supermodels the male gaze in movies and tv this is when the camera pans over a female body or her features often in slomo or something suggesting that the viewer check out how attractive the woman is almost all famous women from singers to actors are very conventionally attractive and often in a similar way not to say we dont also have this with men of course there are the george clooneys of our culture as well but with female celebrities is seems to be more of a prerequisite to fit into the mold im rambling a little but basically my point is that males are taught from a younger age what is supposed to be attractive or not and females have a little more room to figure it out for themselves whereas a guy starts learning what hes supposed to find attractive when he watches his first titty comedy on tv after staying up too late when hes years old i personally didnt start figuring out what i found attractive until i started having questionable feelings listening to the doors when i was in middle school hence the jim morrisonesque emaciated rockstar thing ive got
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude really outkicked his coverage he looks like a fun funny guy though so it makes sense
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,long and grit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cause he goofy looking what do you think
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my parents were married in and im they had me in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow for your age at jesus the rest of the posters are or what
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how did they meet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mmm dem otter pops doe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol thats awesome does he sign bill gate or his real name
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and my monopod from the can do the exact same thing ive seen a few vintage examples of selfies im sure there are a lot out there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lmao this guy has some issues i think
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,woah seriously thats a weird age disparity how do you know
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,farnsworth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey thats my room
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i do i end up filtering out so much of reddit im not into any of the video games earthabandonedetc porn sports or porn
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn i must have offended someone whoops i just dropped that fuck i was about to give
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol jonathan i said hes my dad and he was born in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice people used to get married at im and nowhere near that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,married at op you wouldnt happen to be years old would you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fuck that is young im now and my gf were together for almost years everything ok so far but marriage oh boy im not adult enough for this d but im happy if it works for other people
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats about how old he looks i guessed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that seems pretty rare
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i prefer the original
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks ill show this to them later
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the original is actually better than id expect a polaroid look like after years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well is closer to than today is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,serious topic on it do you think that applies for this day and age i guess its a phenomenon not really because digital photo degradation isnt a thing unless you keep on compressing it for some reason for a digital photo from to look like a digital photo from grainy as shit low resolution etc it was either done intentionally for weird stylistic reasons or someone really fucked up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,these violent delights have violent ends
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,martha our moms have the same name
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think youll enjoy this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,op
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nothing accidental about that invention it was deliberate too bad they didnt patent it and make you a rich heir to their fortune
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,haha they still love eachother they go swimming every week at an old peoples class now and theyre like hip youths to all the year olds
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,remote shutter release colloquially known as stick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mobile
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what thing are we talking about
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yup titles are hard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just tryina be a buddy pal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,look at ops reddit name
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,when i said their names i meant both just saying that its such a small amount of already very public information
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you a hustle fan i dont see many these days please tell me its the english one and not the american remake though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im sure you already have but on netflix there is a great movie about the doors that follows the life of jim morrison i highly suggest it anyway i agree that is what my educated guess would be as well that it is mainly down to cultural aspects
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think theyre on the same level for different reasons
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seriously go check out any post where someone is late someone always makes that comment most people there seem to be late teensearly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,church youth group i believe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his signature is impossible to make out but it starts with a b so there may be someone out there who has my dads signature framed above their computer desk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theyre my parents haha
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hodor
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im not offended just thought that was pretty savage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey its me ur brother lol really we are siblings
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,people still get married at i taught elementary school for awhile and had lots of and year olds whose married parents were in their early to mid
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im near the same age as them i didnt get married until however when i was in high school there was a couple that got married while they were still in high school
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,same im afraid it might not even happen ive got a cat though which is nice
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,people still do its most common in conservativeevangelical communities people dont want to wait until theyre thirty to have sex so they get married very young to either be able to do it by the rules or to hide that they broke the rules its usually the latter my mother was sixteen when she married my father i was the reason why
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i am and i dont even have a gf my female friends are amarried blesbian soshits
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe its an irish thing my brother has a grey patch as well and hes twentyfive and there is a seventeen year old in my year who has a kind of coating of grey hair
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,too bad its not your parents
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they still together
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stop
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wait its not still
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its years either way
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,clarise
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lets fight villains together
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,look we get it youre ops brother im ops brother everyone in this thread is ops brother
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hiyoooooo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well if they kept the tradition of accidentally inventing things
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a letdown
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,selfie sticks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well ya see his parents arent wearing pants in this photo and the thing theyre doing would eventually become op
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its a finglonger
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no theyre not
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just tryina be a pal guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i am and yes the english version as for the remake just to be clear youre talking about leverage which ive never seen right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i saw it ages ago on or something and was stoked to see its on netflix havent given it a rewatch yet val kilmer was perfect in it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reddit always overrates women or maybe they underrate men i agree they are easily on par lookswise
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i think theyre overall the same level but from different groups if that makes sense dad is a nerd mom is normal normie lol they make a cute couple
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow i dont understand howwhywhen became old again we conquered the plague people
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,meeting my future wife is about the only thing that could motivated me to go to church
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i know its just my sense of humor if i really offended anyone well id laugh out loud
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can we get an updated picture would love to see what they look like now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what if i told you they could have had kids before they got married
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there were couples from my high school that got married years later are divorced

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is especially apparent on rrateme where fairly average looking women will be rated then the rater will try to white knight his way into an internet hookup
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,years later the dork has yet to escape him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,were these couples married for the reason of an unwanted pregnancy or otherwise

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whoa danny carey is fucking buff
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,band name checks out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,took me a second to realize that it was really them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,punt guns were essentially gigantic shotguns which were lashed to punts tiny boats and used to kill large amounts of waterfowl for commercial trade they were particularly common in places like the chesapeake bay their use in the usa was outlawed beginning in the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,uhh excuse me there sir i think you turns around oh my god youre dave chapelle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,were they in use elsewhere or was it an american thing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the use of punt guns began in the uk i believe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,actually they began as a british thing theyre actually still legal to use in the uk on a limited basis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats what i remember too but i have seen some references to them being used in the chesapeake region dont hunters have a pretty low opinion of them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think a lot of people are misinformed about punt guns that they wastefully killed thousands of birds with every shot they didnt they werent used for sport either they were used to feed people this historic demonstration is very eyeopening
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks for the link i still dont like them but i appreciate the history a little knowledge goes a long way
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,peta will be in touch
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,eskimo is an offensive term

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,molly you geek thats not how you fit in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she is ecuadorable
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this was about the year i had a super intense crush on her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,molly is now a jazz singer and still gorgeous as all hell
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,her and i are the same age in high school there were two types of guys those who spanked it to molly r and those who couldnt figure out why everyone spanked it to molly r
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,molly ringwald was my first crush as a kid i remember seeing her at the mall of america when i was an adult and stopping dead in my tracks my friends kept walking and when they realized i wasnt with them they looked back and saw me standing there in a total trance

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes my cousin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she is one of my goto movie stars molly is and always was a classic beauty why does everyone nowadays want fake pretty that takes hours to perfect and tons of money when you can be classically beautiful just by being naturally you now dont get me wrong a little makeup doesnt hurt anyone but when all of the models and stars we look up to now have surgically altered their body what does that say to us common folk who cant do that are we beautiful or do we really need that to compete with the unobtainable
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oldest case of resting bitchface

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,growing up we had a sofa with the same material
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think my moms proms dress looked like this i rembr seeing a picture of her in some couch like fabric
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think her and agent scully came from the same batch
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont actually find her very attractive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i got a redhead ho i call her molly ringwald she like to take a lot of molly and bring adderall danny brown
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she is in this photo looks more like
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this was my motorola razr background
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reminds me of somebody that i used to know
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dat blush tho
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the queen of rbf i used to have a huge crush on her i still do but i used to too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was the it girl during my childhood but i never really got hollywoods fascination or other guys attraction to her as an adult though i totally see it nothing makes me feel creepier as a year old man than photos of teenage molly ringwald she was stunning
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this flower look is coming back in style ugh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,never understood why everyone thought she was so attractive i just never saw it personal opinion i guess ill be leaving now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i still dont get why so many people thought she was attractive i mean shes not hideous or anything but shes not a beauty queen either
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no more yankee my wankee the donger needs food
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks a lot like emma watson in this picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks like somebody i used to know
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she is my goddess
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the wallpaper the dress molly this photo is the epitome of the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this reminds me of the scene in garden state of zach braff wearing the shirt that matched the wallpaper
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,always had a thing for her but i was a whopping month old when that pic was taken
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks crabby
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes kinda cute but i never understood the temporary obsession
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes so unattractive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jessica alba
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,her name was always more attractive than she was
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah yes ol gums ringwald
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so basic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this was when she wouldnt show up for a photoshoot unless you had champagne for her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,redhead hoe look like molly ringwald on that molly ringwald
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there was nothing cool about the it was a cacophony of never ending blunderyears
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,molly ringworm
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was always fascinating because you could see that the directors of her movies found her to be absolutely ravishing but she was completely unattractive so i kept looking and thinking to find any conceivable way to see the appeal but there was none none whatsoever shes not offensive and shes talented as an actress but i could never figure out what others saw in her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rpunchablefaces
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i never cared for her she has a cross between rbf and fms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,molly ringworm
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was in an extremely frumpy way somewhat hot for a few months
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how was this girl ever famous she was ugly as fuck and terrible at acting
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how did you manage to get hotter with age i drink the blood of kristen stewart i think im in love all over again
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i enjoyed her interview on this american life episode is a good listen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tldr rampart ahahaha i dont have to even read the rest of it to agree with you though i will
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fall in love molly again for the first time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive just read through it it was before my time as a redditor and i agree also and theres no way of saying this without sounding a little bit moms basement but fuck it shes gone from being a gorgeous young woman in the to being hotter than a rattlesnakes ass in a wagon rut in the good for her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,really i feel like she just catered to what redditors wanted to hear more so than other amas
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my first thought
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to hell with it god bless mollys everywhere
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpimgurcomypsxrri
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,molly did come up in scrubs multiple times
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one of the most underrated movies of all time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my first thought a front paged roldschoolcool image of a white woman that doesnt show any parts of her t or a bonus points for her not smoking drinking or holding a guitar
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i loved that movie pretty fucking weird but still
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that was the effect the photographer was going for dummy but not as dramatic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,breakfast club is still brilliant although no so sure pretty in pink stand the test of time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,anyone else bothered by the fact the picture for back to the future is clearly from back to the future part ii i mean if they just left the date off i would have assumed they meant the series as a whole
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,watch list for the weekend thanks buddy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the raider of the lost ark à² à² 
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow just go bowled over by a wave of nostalgia
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was always more of an ally sheedy no disassemble stephanie and lea thompson kinda guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she is pretty cool from what ive read
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,except she did secret life of the american teen blech
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i looked her up a few years ago and thought ugh she got weird looking then i looked her up again last year and realized no it was just long hair and bangs that looked superweird on her back to shorter hair she is pretty again despite being one of these womens who are pretty smart and seem like decent persons that make you hate yourself for being such a relatively speaking loser
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hell yeah and then there is the wonderful nude scenes she did damn sexy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,growing up in the i really liked the style then but mw was never a big crush for me but i do know what you mean about the gut shot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont think the movie would have worked with ringwald the premise of the movie combined with her image at the time would have made it come off pretty creepy roberts does not even entirely look the part she is supposed to be playing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,at first i thought colorizebot got ahold of this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yah my couch is covered with molly too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is your couch from the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,put a bird on it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes a wall flower get it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh godi remember so vividly in how much i adored her i would daydream about writing an amazing novel or discovering a cure for cancer or something and id become famous and ask her out still working on it lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shed hate that for years afterward she couldnt wear pink no more lol whitegirlproblems
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomriamacommentsssoxciammollyringwaldama link to her awesome ama
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes a total babe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,does that mean hidden in cheese
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,paging uiammollyringwald your cousin is here commenting on one of your june vanity fair picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its me your cousin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,greta garbo is not impressed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,came here just to find the rbf reference
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah me too wonder if this was some sort of inspiration
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just an unfortunate awkward wet blanket version of her barb sucks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the lips
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i never understood peoples obsession with her i see better looking women almost every morning on my way to get coffee
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats some couch
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was born in you made me feel old and sad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you couldnt buy her though thats whats killing you isnt it stef thats it stef she thinks youre shit and deep down you know shes right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i thought so too the first time i saw her in a movie but while watching i found myself captivated by her beauty and her smile she didnt have perfect features nor a perfect body but i think thats what makes her beautiful todays beautiful is just too perfect perfect hair eyebrows flawless skin big boobsbutt you see them in instagram everyday i like her freckly face her and her smile the most
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i came here to say this exact thing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she is attractive but not everyones cup of tea she was never mine particularly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i still dont get why so many people thought she was attractive i mean shes not hideous or anything but shes not a beauty queen either molly is unconventionally attractive and absolutely goes against the hot girl type she has always come across as approachable warm and smart the kind of woman an average guy might have a chance with personality is a big part of her appeal i was eight when the started i dont know any man who wasnt a little bit in love with her at the time maybe you had to be there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre on reddit most of the users browsing that find her attractive grew up with her as a part of their culture white culture i dont find her attractive at all either not saying shes straight up hideous but her face is definitely a boner killer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,except that movie is a pretentious piece of trash
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre so wrong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what is attractive to you if you dont mind my asking i am a female and sometimes i wonder if i am beautiful
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was supposed to look like an average teenage girl that was the draw
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seriously what are these fucking standards completely unattractive i forgot everyone on reddit dates supermodels
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arent you suppose to be in a youtube comment section
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,creep
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was just that good at transcribing not just their words but their inflection their actions etc victoria added a lot of context but also made it more conversational instead of a celeb sitting down and just answering the questions she had a presence that put them at ease and helped them to be more entertaining i cant remember the last time i went to the sub to seek out amas instead of only reading them when they get to the front page they have severely decreased in quality
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,molly is a funny candid quickwitted person there are plenty of disaster amas too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont think she was pandering which amas have you enjoyed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i always wonder what the hell cards like this are even for every time i play magic the games over in five rounds with one player cussing because they had a handful of blue cards and only green mana
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what that card is insanely good
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i bought prophecy boosters on amazon hoping for avatar of woe like in the old days
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn thats a good card
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i kept looking for a person
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i look like a fucking idiot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think i just blue myself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dang forgot about this song
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i watched sixteen candles again the other night and it was completely bizarre theres no way that film could be made today
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,should be mandatory viewing in high school
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i watched it with my teenage daughter last weekend and she asked did you guys really cry like that all the time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes also they put the raider of the lost ark instead of raiders of the lost ark
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think you accidentally a word
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wait wha
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who the f is this mw youre both talking about have i lost my mind
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i have no idea what you guys are talking about maybe its cuz i was born in but i dont understand the appeal of mw im sorry but i just dont find her attractive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what the hell was that i want my minutes back
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you need a tray for your lines
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,peru it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and here i was pounding it to those bright red lips
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i usta think if i cured malaria scarjo would cozy up to me at the ted talk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,omelette du fromage edit spelling
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,do live in norcal not a cosmetologist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no barb is the bomb gtfo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how dare you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks vaguely like her former self there i watched this and had no clue it was her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the lady in black has an armpit boob
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what are you married to her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey thanks for dropping a reply that is basicly what i just said bud thanks a bunch man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,me personally i am attracted specifically to lightskinned black women with long hair and curvy but athletic bodies as far as physical that is examples lauren london paula patton zoe kravitz nikki minaj but who cares what i think is attractive you could be the most beautiful woman in the world and what i think simply does not matter the only thing that matters i that you know youre beautiful love yourself be kind to yourself be gentle to yourself you deserve it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heavy freckles blowupdoll lips and mousey attitude just dont do it for me to each his own i dont mean that shes ugly just notattractive kinda like a sister figure
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cool story bro
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but youre still hopeful you have a chance because some people grow hotter with age
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,from ringwalds actual ama though it seems like victoria wasnt the one transcribing in this case someone asked how she discovered reddit and she said from her friend and current typist dan who is now regretting it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cant argue with that do you know if she ever explained the tldr rampart quip because that is specifically what makes me suspect influenceinput from chooter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you can always tell a milford man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpssoundcloudcomyourstrulysfdannybrownaraabmuzikmollyringwald
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,edh brah
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,considering it has a commander set symbol im guessing it was printed for the commander format but also could be good in draft fake edit it was first printed in shards of alara which may have been a slower format but probably this card only saw play in draft and was terrible in standard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,me too seriously rapey tone to the entire film very uncomfortable
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well a remake that seems to be on fashion
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep breakfast club is pretty great pretty in pink is very mixed and candles is a rapey racist trainwreck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,racist sexist rape humour etc its also so grossly inferior to pretty in pink in other ways that the only proper response to i want to watch sixteen candles is no watch pretty in pink again instead
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its low effort click bait im not surprised
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,name was officially changed to lame but it keeps all films next to each other in lists etc
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,once i context
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,molly ringwald actress in the known for the john hughs films breakfast club lot of guys had crushes growing up i wasnt a fan
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude the only way you would get it would be if the internet never existed and your entire view of the world was from a vhs tape that was slowly wearing out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no problem with that im not a fan of tats and piercings though i did think one womans brow stud was sexy for some reason but im not a fan of mw probably because of her characters normal bitchy demeanor but i do like the style more than now big or fuller hair styles makeup usage stylish clothes plus people seemed much thinner then and clothes looked better on them imo now its uggs and sweatpants or yoga pants whether theyre a hottie or obese no gusta
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,grew up in the dont find her attractive either didnt back in the day either
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,qui a coupÃ© le fromage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes cleopatra
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no problem by the way youre still here i was basically saying it isnt just you and its not that just the mass media saying shes pretty she is pretty and not just in pink i recognize it its just that i wont have dated her phoebe cates on the other hand sigh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the appeal for me is she looks like the kind of girl you can do anything to in the bedroom she would be totally down for you fucking her in the ass while you simultaneously pull her hair and burn her with a cigarette
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,research is ongoing over at
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i havent looked at hers just responding to the inferred criticism of victorias time doing amas
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she mentions that she is a lurker on reddit a few times in that ama before i joined reddit i lurked for like years but once get comment once youre fucked
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ya but what is your first thought
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nobodys first thought was danny brown
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpgfycatcomkindheartedunsteadyequestrian
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hahaha i cant believe i never noticed gay robot and metal on metal in one of my favorite movie scenes of all time i guess i am always too focused on jp himself and how ridiculous he looks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kylo ren
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that music is trash that music is what is bringing down the african american community
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you can tell its a commander because of the way it is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,automobiiiile
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so many movies had that vibe shit revenge of the nerds has actual rape but the nerd was a good lay so it was okay
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can i borrow your underpants for minutes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how is there a rapey tone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah theres no way theyd film a rape scene like in girl with the dragon tattoo or an actress giving a real blowjob to the director like in brown bunny
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pretty in pink you mean the inferior mopefest not directed by john hughes no thanks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks but how is it w if her names ringwald seems weird
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,me neither either
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my fucking car is stalled
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jesus christ man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whoa
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i figured just wanted to add some detail on this particular case whoever dan is he did a good job
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,everybody who knows who he is is too busy listening to atrocity exhibition
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,checkkkk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mine was i actually dont know anything about molly ringwald
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i finally get an abstract reference on reddit without having to google yay me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,everyones entitled to their opinion i love it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes god i used to say this all the time including the full no yanky my wanky back in the day when hungry even back in the plenty of people didnt know the reference so kudos to you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and she did wind up marrying him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes a goofy awkward hormonally charged teenager who wants to look cool to his friends she willingly gives them to him youre really over thinking this that is why this movie could not be made today because the mindset of most people is to automatically be triggered by some of the most innocent stupid things
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and then jake gets them from geekweird that he doesnt get a name like its a totally normal thing to want
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the scene where jake tells geek he can take his girlfriend home and there is a serious implication that he can fuck her since shes passed out drunk plus geeks continuous attempts at jumping on samantha in the car im not saying it was rape just that it had a veeery rapey atmosphere that was unnerving
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how about a romantic comedy leading actor implying his girlfriend is drunk enough for another character to fuck her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,really doe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sure they are in my opinion is sounds like the music that year olds listen to when they first smoke weed and suddenly think theyre hood
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you are cancer for culture educate yourself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hell my wife and i still say it often today i had my teens watch the movie last summer so theyd better understand my references as well but they werent as amused by it as i was weird science which i recalled as being similarly funny they thought was just plain stupid have to cue up tremors sometime soon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stockholm syndrome
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats not the rapey part the rapey part is with the extraordinarily drunk prom queen and sober farmer ted
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont get why it seems more important to you that people can make rape jokes than it is for people who experience it a lot more than you think to be protected from them the scene where the girlfriend is offered up when he keeps making unwanted physical advances to ringwalds character dont trivialise his behaviour by saying he is goofy and awkward the movie is totally rapey and they cant be made today because women are finally being given a say on a high enough level on what is or isnt appropriate edit wow this comment was coasting on upvotes and then bang in a matter of minutes but i guess its only srs who brigades
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you using the word trigger triggered me omg i said trigger ah i said trigger again
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think he did that because he knew she was embarrassed by it it wasnt like a creepyperv move
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you know the implication
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but she says no and he stops right so isnt that ipso facto not rapey
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dont forget the creepy vibe coming from her grandparents eww
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,have you sought counseling yet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,aint it funny is my favourite so far
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont think anyone would disagree with you that a rapey kind of joke is crude and offensive but thats kind of the point of why it would be included in a movie these are fictional characters youre only supposed to empathize with them and hold them accountable to an extent take its always sunny some of the worst people on the planet and yet theyre some of my favorite characters i do think its important that people have a conversation about rape and imo the most important thing is that certain types of pushy guys learn to pay attention to the emotional state of someone theyre with privately im not discounting rape at all im just describing imo the type of guy that is used to willfully ignoring boundaries and which very much results in the experience of rape for the person whom he does that too anyway my point is that we should absolutely have that conversation but we should also not go around trying to bury things because they are inappropriate or because people need to be protected from them were not talking about a minute scene of a graphic rape in a pg film were talking about some campy writing if youre offended by the character that was probably the writers intent
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it was a summer comedy movie from years ago put the tumblr down and back away
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yowzers not trying to be an ass but you sound younger than probably still an undergrad congrats you learned about feminism and cultural theory most people dont now stop using these tools like a hammer on everything they are like scalpels the people that created the concepts of patriarchy wave feminism etc spent their entire lives sculpting these ideas in many respects they were total outcasts who were physically mentally and emotionally abused for speaking out dont disrespect their sacrifice so you can score some karma on reddit its disgraceful also try moving past cultural studies i can tell you havent yet try reading some julia kristeva focus on the part about mimicking the patriarchal system in your rebellion instead of creating new a path forward
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shoo get back over to twoxchromosomes and dont come out until you can behave
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,triggered
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she willingly gave them to him and then was embarrassed by it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so these girls are in danger
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jumping on top of someone youve just kissed once on the cheek and only sort of know from the bus is still a bit rapey
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes rapey grandparents hahaha jesus christ
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude nobody in this thread is triggered except for you i fucking love a raunchy comedy as much as the next guy hell i honestly think rape jokes can be funny depending on delivery but telling a guy he can drive a girl home and most likely get lucky because shes literally too drunk to stand is not a joke or funny line incredibly cunty for a character that is not even supposed to be an asshole nobody is boycotting the movie but youd have to be blind not to see how unnerving that is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rape jokes aside there was still long duck dong the super racist stereotype they might as well have given him a rice hat and kimono
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,never did cultural studies graduated a long time ago all i have are the experiences of women close to me roldschoolcool is not an intellectual forum and this discussion never tried to be
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude here actually gotta keep fighting the good fight
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think it may be because of the httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvacicfgovija ted runs with the panties
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes a year old girl so yes ever do anything stupid that you then probably immediately regretted especially when you were young
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im not a dude ive seen the movie several times its one of my favorites ive never been unnerved by it because its just a fucking light hearted comedic movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,serious question why is it racist he was an asian exchange student that couldnt speak english very well wackiness ensues i mean ive personally met asians that sound very much like him ive also met children of asian immigrants with southern american redneck accents so i wouldnt assume everyone of asian descent sounds like him but i dont think the movie does either ive heard this complaint for years that he was a racist stereotype but is that automatically true just because he has an accent
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the name doesnt bother me much i went to college with a girl named poon tang her parents were from vietnam and she went by vivian and worked with woman named so young poon some foreign names sound odd in other languages
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thank you i and nearly every woman ive been gotten to know irl have been sexually assaulted at least once already in our lives rape culture is a bigger deal than reddit seems to think
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nope
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ok i read it i guess i still dont see anything inherently racist about the way the character is presented in the movie hes portrayed as a strange goofball but so are most of the other nonasian characters in the film except for molly ringwald and jake thats where the comedy comes from we get two normal teenagers we can identify with contrasted against a landscape of weirdos who make their lives miserable and give them something to overcome if anything i think peoples negative reaction to the character says more about them than the movie just my cents
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those flip up sunglasses looking fly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fucking paul newman seemed to have it all
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if you look carefully they are actually faux webbed wheels not sure real ones could stand up to mph
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was a cool cat thats for sure theres a great documentary about his racing career called winning i never realized he was that accomplished of a driver
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i remember watching him race as a kid he was in his i think at the time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ninja justice warrior cooler than a sjw i guess
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cornwallis ns
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,artillery training with the old fns nice do you know if he was fulltime reg force or parttime reserve and if so where

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my dad passed on a few years ago and i didnt even like him that much but i think of him often something about a parent dying really just changes you in unimaginable ways its weird to both simultaneously not be able to grasp that he truly is no longer of this world and mourn that knowledge at the same time its a weight that for me never passed i just got used to carrying it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to everyone telling op to go fuck himself and whatnot lighten up someone made a comment in a thread saying go on throw it up in there with a just found a photo of my dad from the seventies he died last year title and go full scrooge mcduck in the karma op just decided to try it he actually copied word for word a comment in the original thread

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not even the same guy who said to do this post
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so thats why when i saw this i thought this looks like some kid from early dressing up in a suit to look sharp or be different just like my friends did also now that i actually look the hair is too long and unruly to be disco era and i had friends that dressed like this every once in a blue moon to look coolbe different mostly kids that were into ska and alternative music also the car still in the background came out in the late early iirc
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol proved them right i guess
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i knew id seen this before pitchforks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i am surprisingly relieved that the guy on the picture isnt dead
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no man its all a mistake the other guy stole my photo and shopped in a jeep before i had a chance to post this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,plus the photo qualitys too good no snapshot from is that clear
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the wood paneled white topped dodge in the background screamed at least should have taken that out too

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you totally stole that dudes karma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well he has achieved the limit of karma whoring
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and you waited a month to call him out so you could both reap the sweet karma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i knew it i was like someone cloned the driveway behind him

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,look at the original post people said that if you shopped the jeep in the background out then noone would tell its from op was just testing that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the sob story is word for word from the comments of the other thread where they shopped out the jeep and said to post it here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,waaaaaaaaah waaaaaaaaah
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he even photoshopped out the jeep lmao
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i bet its still sitting broken down in that driveway

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cause people lie its a war of all against all gilfoyle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what op forgot to do was photoshop out the chrysler lebaron woody convertible in the background the kcar platform didnt arrive until
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the k car in the background was late

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,chrysler lebaron i think and it was old in the pic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well they certainly didnt just discover it one day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,by making up a stupid lie and then deleting the post from his history oookay
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,chances are op wasnt even the one to photoshop it theres a comment thread posted above from blunder years where someone else photoshopped it out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats what im saying
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no worries fam i gotchu
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that works and hed be
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i apologize i read the title and it tugged at my heartstrings having lost my own father not terribly long ago i felt bad then saw the picture and got irrationally angry its stupid internet for stupid internet points it just made me sad dredging up feelings then turning out to be a complete shitpost
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fucking idiots do
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i saw it on the blunder years sub
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but you gotta downvote him just because he didnt know geez
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wellshit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes lying dumbass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to be precise looks like its just off spotted owl
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one look at the vans hes wearing makes it quite obvious
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes but why so stupid and sad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,op isnt even the one who made the comment uprofessorpan did
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its copied pasted from that comment thread complete with typo in the title
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,someone was also supposed to comment on the fact he was lying for some piggy back karma but looks like someone beat them to it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,same shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this gif is reversed in case anyone thinks its some guy dipping a kangaroo into a cattle grid
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you sir have excelled me have at thee

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pst upitchforkemporium
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how should we call a bunch of small branches tied together with a bow or string
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,intelligent design
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,some guy in the comments suggested this title and was highly upvoted so the guy who posted this one used it to see if people would catch on or not
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,someone photoshopped out the jeep in the comments but it wasnt that great and you could see there used to be a jeep there so or someone else did a better job and i didnt see that comment or op just retuched the photoshop i saw and uploaded that edit ok no jk he just used the imgur the guy in the original posts comments posted
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i see its better to take out that anger in a reddit comment nobody cares about than on an actual person i suppose keep doing things that makes you happy and focused on other stuff it will settle eventually all the best
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of something that is both httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermfake and httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermgay popularized by breakcom dude did you see that new video on breakcom yeah it was fake and gay httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the shoes is what tipped me off too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was going to say that the houses look like where my family lives in vacaville ca my dad has a house that looks exactly like that and it was built in the late
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,true even though vans were popular in southern california in the slipons didnt debut until the early
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,vans existed since yeah
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for me it was more the plastic siding i dont actually know the historical timeline for that but i feel like older suburban homes combine siding and brick and that pure siding for a house that size is more contemporary i just know older people would tell me dont buy a house thats all siding because its cheap could also be geographic maybe pure siding is ok in warmer climates but i feel like in the north old houses tend to have brick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,citation me because i had this unfortunate haircut in the haha
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably more brick too right these houses here are all siding
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks even up to a few days before he passed if i was upset about anything he always put it into perspective and had me laughing about it i only hope to be able to do that for my own kids
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,golden brown
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the fine corinthian leather was on the cordoba a significantly nicercooler car
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it reminds me of the awful clashing flannel checkerboard design that was on everything back then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he clearly did it to because he thought it would be funny but nah youre right everything should be super serious no joking allowed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,e
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah thats kinda the logic of all reposting losers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but complaining on reddit is what makes me happy p
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,uincredulousnipple explain
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol pardon me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but the foto claims
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youd have to be american to be able to know that honestly as a european all your houses look the same to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thank you i was thinking the same thing and then started doubting myself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i believe its a i dont think they made a custom woody version passed that plus the shape of the nose passed changed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nah its tasteless to lie about your parents death for internet points
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no it is not its lame
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seemed to be making fun of all the things that will get something on the front page got a good laugh reading the thread
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you poor bastard you triggered the normies their perpetually offended sadness train will downvote your lulz into oblivion the internet is serious business not a place for fun
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wait youre telling me the side of those houses is literally plastic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes especially here in texas
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im sure youll be able to as youve been given a great example to follow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the original post
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,poop brown
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its known as artistic license for humorous effect
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you are referencing urban dictionary to try and show you arent against homosexuality
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tasty waves
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe no one in idaho
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,marlon brando is a definite contender
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nationally yes but that was very much in style in southern california i cant remember which school but fast times is based on a san diego high school
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that car used to belong to jon voight

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i like the cut of your jib
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im going to guess you arent funny and shouldnt try to tell others what is by virtue signalling you neo victorians are seriously gross
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ancap seems about right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,um yeah does that surprise you why
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no its a fucking meme thats not meant to be taken literally read the rest of the page and where it originated from obviously many people dont seem to be familiar with it my statement is independent from my views on homosexuality
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ok one year before jeff spicoli
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the leather jacket in the wild one no reason to caps that but im too lazy to change it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,john voigt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the actor
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the joke could have been pulled off without the grief aspect i agree thats the part that is lame i didnt vote on ops post because karma doesnt matter to me but this is just a shitty lie when it could have been funny
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,at least i leave you guessing you just proved that youre as entertaining as wet cardboard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes it does im european im used to everything being solid
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if youve got proof ill recant
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the ocean of water ends at the sand but the monkey you love was killed by a man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i recall reading that the tshirts in a streetcar named desire had a big influence too it helped push the idea of just wearing a tshirt with nothing over it more into the mainstream
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,too lazy to change it but not too lazy to write a whole extra sentence about how youre not going to change it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nope marlon brando started the trend of wearing tshirts when he starred in streetcar named desire
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,john voight
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,periodontist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what about barbara mandrells skateboard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,interesting didnt know that thanks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,on a related note it is unsubstantiated but widely believed that while shooting the scene where he undresses clark gable had trouble removing his undershirt while keeping his humorous flow going and took too long as a result the undershirt was abandoned altogether it then became cool to not wear an undershirt which resulted in a large drop in undershirt sales around the country this refers to gables performance in it happened one night
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats not writing its momentum
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,true
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,an edit would have shown more sportsmanship instead you just censored your mistake
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i actually heard something similar about gone with the wind the scene where he carries scarlett up the stairs with his shirt unbuttoned and is clearly not wearing an undershirt led to a large decline in sales
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,more necklaces john
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,awe

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dem boots dow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what is this witchcraft
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,zippers have been around in some capacity for over years the modern zipper as we know it was developed around the turn of the century clearly ornamental what thats exactly where pockets would be on a hunting jacket photo quality is absolutely on par with the era in fact this is a pretty low resolution scan i shoot old film cameras that are even older than the and the photo quality is on par with what we have today filmcamera tech was highly developed by that time the reason most old photos look shitty is because camerasfilm were expensive unless you bought a cheap snapshot camera with no adjustments most people had no idea how to take good photos
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its a bot its pretty neat someone almost always will call it up when an old pic is posted with no coloring its not the greatest but its like our little automated reddit butler friend alredred colorizebot

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,soooo young trump
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i know this is meant as an insult but i dont understand why i should be im assuming that youre trying to make me feel somehow ashamed that my father was a white guy with a suit on in the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nah im not trying to be an asshole he just looks like that other guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to be fair young trump was a stud
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not that hard for me to give himthe wrong advices
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who is the largest person whos ever competed in body building at the highest level i knew lou was slightly bigger than arnold but i didnt realize he almost looks like he belongs in a bigger weight class
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow i didnt know lou was bigger than arnie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou was such a beefy hunk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow rare photo of the terminator the hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that guy in the center is trying to hold back tears from having his hands crushed by monsters
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnie is giving a bro handshake lou is holding hands
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would love for someone to answer this question for me as i have zero answers my father had a great love of bodybuilding for many years i grew up watching competitions why when i watch these old competitions the bodybuilders bodys seem much more natural than their modern counterparts the modern body builders look almost grotesque while these guys look like greek gods new training techniques to stack on more muscle are the modern competitions run by who can shoot up more steriods im sure arny and lou used steriods but the older generation always seemed to have a more natural big fucking guy body type while the modern men and women look half human half rhino
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the man is on a decade hot streak
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,come with me if you want to lift
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,personally in the sport of body building i really dislike the trend to be overly vascular and have odd veins poking out everywhere these guys both look big and swole but also natural and more like ancient greek sculptures aesthetically i find this a lot more pleasing than the overly veiny look that is so common today
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what an interesting life arnold has had
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow someone make that man governor
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my dad knows lou did you know he was pretty much deaf until about ten years ago when he got special hearing aids now his life has been changed and is the happiest hes ever been so awesome
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,because the comment section of most posts involving bodybuilders that reaches the front page often descends into meaningless quarrels about steroids when neither party knows anything about them heres a plug for the httpswwwredditcomrsteroidswikiindex please familiarise yourself with some of the basics before making dumb comments like they make your dick fall off or arnie is natural
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that trophy skipped leg day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,these body builders look a lot better then the freakshows you see today
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i could take them both at the same time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats more of a hand hold than a hand shake
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou had more size but arnold had more definition
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy shit lou is huge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou must have had a hell of a time understanding arnie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just admit it you looked at arnolds penis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow ferrigno is a hulk compared to arnold
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,man i worked at salt lake comicon a couple of years back lou pulled in serious crowds he had a bigger line than shatner and there were always people lining up for him it was impressive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou out angleing arnold on the dailypropahhh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,joe weider in the middle he is a legendary montreal entrepreneur and philanthropist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,terminator be hulk who would win
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its kinda crazy arnold was and i knew ferrigno was physically taller but i didnt realize just how big he was he is just massive and i can understand him coming in second place it would be hard for him to be as defined with a thicker build like that edit i was apparently mistaken in arnolds height he is closer to or
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold in his prime aka the greatest urien cosplay that never happened
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ayayayay
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i want them both to punch me in the vagina
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou is a big mfkermy dad worked out with him in the early too but as you can see arnold has the cuts and superior physique
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they look like condoms filled with meatballs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,id hate to see that guy whens hes angry
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im not saying theres any sort of compensating for anything going on here but that trophy sure is big
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where mike katz and his rusty bike fender having ass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i can really see why they picked lou ferrigno over arnold for the incredible hulk series the difference is clear here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,these are like the proportions of toriko characters
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn lou fit the hulk role better then i ever knew
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes closer to the camera here but still he was bigger than arnold
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnie is way more aesthetic and shredded
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jojos bizarre adventure battle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lous bigger just not as shredder
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so there we have it proof the incredible hulk could totally kick the terminators arse
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow lou was hot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold had the definition in the muscles lou is just a big fucker
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnie may have been more defined but lou had the beefy sex appeal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i mean body mass alone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jesus look at the size of lous hands
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,giant he makes arnold look tiny
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou is a fuckin monster jesus
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou ferrigno is an absolute beast he is still the voice of the hulk to date
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its like a pokÃ©mon contest between charmeleon and charizard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cant beat a good arnold movie ill be back hes getting old now but still makes great movies just like stallone and van damme
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,quality over quantity
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tren hard anavar give up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this photo fills me with jealousy not because of the muscles but because in arnies day you could literally just decide to move to america as he did no complicated job offer process or need of a degree or sponsoring he just upped and left austria in search of a better life i would love to be able to do the same
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,serious question can ppl reach this level or is everyone at this level roiding
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how how many push ups did they do sit ups what kind of juice
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats incredible they are so hulked up especially lou
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,billy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,after that day and surgeries later that presenter still never recovered the full use of either hand
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they are both terrifyingly jacked
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude in the middle looking oddly happier than the both of them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou is like twice the size of arnie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would never say it to his face but hes got great thighs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,terminator meets the hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i now see why lou played hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he dwarfs arnold
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jesus the body mass alone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i know lou ferrigno well enough to connote him with the hulk but i didnt realize it was literal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those bulges are not tumors
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,totally taking a deep breath there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jesus how tall was lou
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a lot of meat in that single photo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,someone need to photoshop macs face from its always sunny onto the judge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i mean the mass alone here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my hands hurt my hands hurt my hands hurt smile my hands hurt my hansmile hurt my hands hurt my hands hurt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i may look like a barbarian but this fellow is a hulk of a man things i hope arnold said
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the terminatorwith the hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and they both talk weird
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats dedication
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,guy in the middles face okay youre breaking my hands guys
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why did ferigno look so fat and dumpy as the hulk was it the pancake makeup i dont remember him looking this big and defined

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whos headed to the arnolds this week in cbus

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i can see why lou lost but regardless goddamn hes a big ass man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the austrian oak what a guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment one of my favorite quotes is that the ping pong inmate from the longest yard remake with adam sandler because that dude was xxxl edit bad quality in case you havent seen it httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvbdvcfdiotcy reminded me of bill burr on arnold swarzenegger yeah most people around that height struggle to gain any appreciable size are plagued with physical complications and walk like they have bad arthritis a big athletic man at that height is something to behold and pretty terrifying and awe inspirin one of my favorite quotes push ups sit ups squats and running every single day youre righthes about and some change lewis hamilton champ is and here the two meet markus ruhl was a very large gentleman here he is shopping always cracks me up i especially love it when said warpigs are only selfhating short people relevant markus ruhl was one of the biggest ever how long did it take to read two weeks im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch ill keep this updated as long as i can httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get me on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god damn lou you a big motha fucka
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnolds bicep looks like a face
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold looks tiny next to lou
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude on the right looks like someone took his photo and dragged the borders on paint to make him bigger damn that dude huge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,isnt that the hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,imagine greasing up those beefcakes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,beasts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they should just go ahead and man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the guy behind these two fellas looks like james bond villain
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did peter jackson take this photo is there some forced perspective going on or is this realistic the hulk makes arnie look like a hobbit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpsyoutubexuhvcotsbam
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a couple of wimps look at emholding hands disgusting
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why didnt he come out for lacrosse
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they have muscles in thier poop
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what i wouldnt give to get tagteamed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is why arnie didnt get to be hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its cute how they are holding hands
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the hulk and the terminator
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou might never beat the role he had in king of queens
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and the happiest priest in the world
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow thats a big trophy i hope they can lift it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow nothing to say
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lous bigger but arnies just so perfectly defined its like he was sculpted
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,til lou ferrigno could have whipped the shit out of arnie back in their body building primes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,asteriks and obeliks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wonder who has the tighter grip on that old fellas hand
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thicc
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,two guys wearing nothing but underwear covered in oil holding hands with sugar daddyoooh kinky
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is what lost in the sauce looks like
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow stronger person with great muscle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and ben weider
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou your moms going to cook us spaghetti
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one of my favorite quotes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no wonder he succeeded in politics lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was a professional bodybuilder in india hes also police officer and mostly vegetarian but wouldnt call it the highest levels but the guy behind him in the photo did compete in mr olympia was and around competed in the arnold classic which is pretty high level arnold schwarzenegger is actually the tallest person to win the mr olympia title at all others have been under but i believe actually lou ferrigno at was actually the tallest to compete in mr olympia
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,didnt look thru the comment thread but def big ramy hes cut down a lot now but he weighs like in the off season
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,since people are just guessing and throwing out random names his stage weight is around highest being at the olympia no one has ever stepped on the olympia stage at before
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for current bodybuilders i think the win goes to big ramy for overall size only but his show weight is around just a massive dude
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this guy used to sell supplements in my old hometown his name was noah steere lbs biggest dude ive ever seen haha i believe he was a pro bodybuilder at some point
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,isnt it partly because he is closer to the camera look how much the size of their faces and heads differ from this perspective yet on this photo arnold has a bigger head
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the weight classes back then were over and under the biggest was probably markus ruhl look him up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they are both smaller than many of the recent mr olympia winners ronnie coleman looked like he could eat someone arnies size for breakfast literally google some side by side pictures
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ronnie coleman guy is a freak
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but less defined hence his place
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold wasnt really that big remember hes twins with danny devito
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yup the hulk show wanted arnold and he turned them down and suggested lou was the better choice
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,v
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou was a monster not as defined as arnold in this photo he may have been bulking but holy cow how massive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its important to pack on mass dennis youre talking about carboloading
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its incredible
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,watch pumping iron
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou was such a beefy hulk ftfy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah but he looks so much more human and normal at the same time quite interesting to see
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stop calling me hulk im a person
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i sincerely doubt theres any wrinkly old dudes into bodybuilding for any other reason besides to get crushed by muscly men look at that mans smile those are tears of joy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats joe weider he helped put bodybuilding and arnold on the map of the american public
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou is crushing his hand
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whats the matter cia got you pushing too many pencils
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold is doing it to show off those biceps he was the master of selfpromotion
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou didnt have much of a choice hes holding the dudes opposite hand lous right with dudes left arnold is on the other side and since both he and lou are facing the center arnold gets to also use his right hand with the dudes right hand so he can do a normal handshake
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ever since the which showed the advent of mass monsters like ronnie coleman and dorian yates the presentation of pure muscle seems to be the most important part of the sport bodybuilders usually look to the winners of the competitions before them to witness the path to winning if these types of bodybuilders are winning i will not stand a chance just trying to aspire to an old classic physique back in the early days of bodybuilding the main steroids were deca durabolin dianabol and primobolin they tend to give the muscle a more rounded look also back then they didnt really know how to get super shredded as dnp and clenbutrol wasnt really heard of nowadays hgh trenbolone testosterone mastedon and winny are used to achieve that dickskinned mass monster that wins bodybuilding trophies the new classic physique class still is not set in stone and id say still strays far from the truly great physiques of yesteryear with people still coming in shredded to the t and giant quadriceps the classic physiques like arnold are hard to come by as no one wins competitions looking like that anymore
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,more drugs theres a classic division in bodybuilding now which has bodybuilders trying to look like the golden age or close to what you see here although theyre still more lean today many different divisions today mr olympia is still the biggest though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,drugs and better drugs we simply know more about body building nutrition etc the same reason a drug free body builders in the looked bigger and better than one in the etc those are probably the main reasons also know we etc tvs and photos didnt make things look as good back then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not just more drugs but better drugs many advancements in pharmacology have been made since the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,drugs pump and dehydration
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the entire bodybuilding life was way different back then what kind of is interesting that in arnold time the training meta was to train as much as possible often they spent hours at the gym a day todays bodybuilder most of the time train times a week min or so source dennis james markus rÃ¼hl dorian yates people in arnold times didnt know how important rest was when you just look at the sake of muscle growth also back in the it was believed that you need to stay lean all year around so their diet didnt change much around the year and they eat clean all year long todays super heavyweight bodybuilders often look almost fat in off season google lee priest offseason they often eat as much as possible in off season which results in more muscle drugs like dnp then tren then assured they would be even more lean then arnold ever was in the golden area the contest bodyfat was around while today its propably below is almost impossible no matter what some people claim
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he married a kennedy for christs sake
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reminded me of
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,run get to the bench press
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hi im colorizebot i was trained to color bw photos not comics or rgb photos please do not abuse me i have digital feelings this is my attempt to color your image here you go if you called the bot and didnt get a response pm us and help us make it better httpwwwwhatimadetodaytwoweeksofcolorizebotconclusionsandstatistics httpsgithubcomdannyvairedditcrawlerstreemasterredditbotcolorize httprichzhanggithubiocolorization
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what is this voodoo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the v shape used to be a large part of body building back then there was inspiration to look like greek gods now body builders have bloated stomachs which stick out further than their chest and look nothing like the chiselled greek statues but more like bulls pumped with steroids
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that veiny low bodyfat look started because the athletes believed it better showed their muscular development in the past judges looked for muscle size and overall symmetry but as the years went on they started looking at each muscle group individually one of the great early examples of this was time mr olympia httpimgurcomaehzmz although he was known as mr symmetry he pioneered the ripped look
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,or that bodybuilers look differently now due to just using more steroids as if its like chemical bane uses to get swole in the batman cartoon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in the ass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and still manly af
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,besides size you have to look at the muscular development lou is bigger because of his big frame but the muscles on arnolds arms traps back and legs are better developed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that is ben weider brother of joe weider and president of the ifbb httpimgurcomadkfts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bravo sir
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if terminator be hulk then no one wins only terminator hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hulk not even a contest
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold was hes really about some even say hes closer to
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,these pics httpimgurcomaegyii and httpimgurcomaihdae are great for size comparison of arnold
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold in his was probably around judging by the thousands of photos we have of him now he would be around
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,awaken my masters
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they are heavily lubricated
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey stop with the swole shamming
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,someone is salty lmfao
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you look like condoms filled with fat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you would not like him when hes angry
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well they cant bend over very well to pick up small trophies with all that muscle in the way
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou is actually near deaf not so much an accent
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,actually he had a work visa via weider pay was rock bottom thoughthe lowest weider can pay and still get a visa for arnold
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,people can reach this level but not without steroids
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,steroids were common place in bodybuilding back then they were prescribed by doctors and given to athletes as supplements they were not considered drugs or outlawed until the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lotsa pushups lotsa situps orange juice
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is not the result of paltry training this is destiny
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe you are projecting your wish fulfillment fantasies here a bit but hey no judgment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one this is at a competition when they have been dieting down for a few months no one should be competition lean yest round second mainstream people always thought bodybuilders were grotesque therefore directors wanted them to come in softer and less defined
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,perspective watch pumping iron ferigno is around inches taller but arnie looked as big width and girth wise
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,already
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh man this had me rollin way harder than it shouldve
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one of my favorite quotes httpsmyoutubecomwatchvheidffygsno
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the khali guy is the big inmate in the longest yard right if not looks exactly like him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is that the ping pong inmate from the longest yard remake with adam sandler because that dude was xxxl edit bad quality in case you havent seen it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,photographic evidence that the great khali actually has knees
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mostly vegetarian woah also dang what a chin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,edited nice history
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dalips leg is bigger than me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,til great khali was a bodybuilder before making raw and smackdown a living nightmare for each of his segments for over half a decade
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold is actually
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,am i wrong or is that the big henchman dude from the get smart movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ahh my god they almost dont look like people anymore
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where do they buy pants
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is that bizzaro kevin hart on the left
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his upper body looks better than heaths but those legs are all kinds of disproportionate phils a freak of nature too though pretty sure dennis wolf is about and is consistently at the top
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know much about bodybuilding but why does ramy look so much better then heath despite placing lower then him ramy looks bigger and more defined despite being so heavy shouldnt this ensure him more success
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,right by the definition of the term competed at the highest level this is the correct answer big remy is a super freak
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,man i forgot how bad heath looked at olympia he looked amazing last year though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes not thats what he claims but i met him and hes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,must be hard walking amongst mere mortals christ i didnt know he smoked lol unbelievable hes still doing okay and not that much smaller than when he competed hes still gigantic even for bodybuilding standards
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,better chemicals make no mistakes ronnie was a beast though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ronnie at his heaviest competed at lbs at the german grand prix at guy made professional bodybuilders look like children next to him the people listed above khali and kovacs were definitely the tallest but lb for lb ronnie packed on way too much muscle on his frame with freaky conditioning shredded glutes in at mean wtff in the words of mr olympia jay cutler who himself was a behemoth nobody could beat him he was just too damn big
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive met ronnie in person he was the guest judge at a nationals competition that the guy who owned the gym i used to go to ran and he stopped by the night before can confirm hes just a massive dude it was like a tree uprooted and strolled through the door
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not just that even its showmanship and posing as well i read arnies autobiography years ago by the time lou was on scene arnie was the fucking master and knew how to strike poses and woo the judges i actually highly suggest reading his book its fascinating and inspiring its called total recall
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,too fluffy and not symmetrical
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know how much artificial help body builders from that age used but their bodies are beautiful like more buffed greek statues nowadays last few decades that is it has gotten so ridiculous that its just hideous it should never be only about the size but aesthetics too and this away maybe people wont damage their bodies so much too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but bigger means hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i doubt it was true but arnold even looked stronger than lou lou was just huge though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not being into body building i like the less defined look better it looks less rippled which i find more attractive pure aesthetics on another note lou ferrigno has a profound hearing loss and was an awesome hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,id rather look like lou though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would fight arnold if i had to choose tough
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,something about proportions as well
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah but all of danny devitos muscle lies in his magnum dong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey with hollywood so obsessed with old properties whats the chance theyd spring for a sequel i nominate seth rogen as director
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was pounds or so in that pic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold couldnt do the accent grrrrrrrrrrrrrr grrrrrrrrrrr cut arnold thats great but can you growl a little less austrian
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnolds height has been a thing of debate in the bodybuilding world for a long time the general consensus these days is that he was not more likely he is also now so as mentioned in another comment sounds accurate for current height to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i always here that arnold is but i saw him at a speech in sacramento he walked maybe ft away from me and i swear he was maybe im and he was no way taller than me still hella buff though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well i mean he was the hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he wouldnt have been bulking if hed just stepped off a contest stage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they all cut for months leading up to competitions he wasnt bulking arnold was just better
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if he was in competition shape then he was most definitely not bulking
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes literally standing on the competition stage in the picture its not likely he that he didnt go through the cutting phase before performing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,body mass alone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,get your finger out of my face and stop calling me hulk okay im a person
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fuck you lou ferrigno one of my favorite movies of all time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hulk is a person bruce banner to be exact
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what hand
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,upvote for dick skinned mass monsters âº
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think dorian yates kicked off the shift also the use of a couple other substances like synthol and gh igf and hgh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wrong nothing about nutrition or workouts has changed radically to the point that it would affect their physique the only thing that has changed their look is growth hormone trenbolone and the other new substances
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not just the better drugs though its better science nothing about modern bodybuilders isnt planned down to a tee every gram of food they eat and every rep they do is designed to make them as huge as possible they just didnt have the knowledge and science back then that we do now and every little bit along the way has helped get these guys bigger you have to wonder where it stops though theres gotta be a ceiling to the growth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and then fucked the maid
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thatsthejokejpg
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that was amazing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thatll do bot thatll do
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice try bot however everyone knows ferrigno should be green
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no its a robot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive noticed that about the stomachs as well and always wondered why that was like that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its like you know me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was going to ask why he didnt have the signature joe mustache are the weiders good people given the frequency of their name on product i assumed it was a emerillike thing id love to learn that they turned that money toward helping people
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn they look scary here almost like puppets or wax figures
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if terminator be hulk but existentially uncomfortable with the fact then terminator who be hulk lose
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would say closer to he walked by me one time in sun valley and i had to do a double take because he was so much shorter than expected
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive met him in person and i am and was visibly taller than him id say he was or
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,brodin be with us
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats just wrong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ð
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lous feet are closer to the camera
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his delivery is so perfect
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn it why was it so funny i knew exactly what he was going to say and here am i chuckling without control
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes also in get smart
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i saw him in a hotel in seattle once he is truly a scary human
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,richard kiel is the inmate in the longest yard hes also in moonraker i cooked his burger when i worked at innout and he was a huge guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yup he was in the wwe for a while also
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wonder why they made him look so short in that scene all the wide shots he looks as tall as sandler maybe he just couldnt play ping pong and had to have a stand in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sure as hell made it seem like he didnt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he must be really far away or have a bad camera anglei dont see how either of those could account for the huge apparent difference though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how do we know the guy behind him is maybe i missed some part of the story
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold is definitely shorter now than at his peak people shrink past a certain age and arnold is not exactly a kid
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre righthes about and some change lewis hamilton champ is and here the two meet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he stood by me in church hes not maybe even
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i imagine he was in his prime but definately not now weights have been proven to not be good for your spine esp after years plus you naturally shrink as you get older and arnold is what
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i met ole lou at a comic booktoy convention in like ish and was so let down when he stood up for the pic because we were eye to eye and im hahai was expecting the hulk i think even pumping iron says hes like or something crazy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,phil heath guy on left is actually a diglett who came out of the ground
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep bodybuilding isnt about aesthetics anymore its about becoming a freak its sad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the guy on the rights abs looks like theyre doing the same pose as he is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,at the pants store
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i remember apollo ono speed skater with huge thighs say in an interview once that you pretty much have to get everything tailored to not look baggy especially dress pants
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ramy holds a lot of water when compared to other bbers heath was really off this year but his flow worked a lot better than ramys look at the difference between upper quad separation between heath and ramy ramys lower back and just back in general holds a lot of water as well once he starts consistently nailing conditioning hell do a lot better
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as good as genetics are the differences in steroidpct usage has been a big reason why guys are getting so much bigger mass monster bodybuilders today run dosages that were unheard of years ago not to mention people in arnolds era never did a pct either
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the documentary pumping iron is also a great look at this era of bodybuilding in general but if you havent seen it before just keep in mind that the rivalry and depiction of arnolds villainous behavior toward lou is exaggerated to the max with the participation of everyone involved the filmmakers needed a story and the bodybuilders were happy to provide it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lots and lots of headgames as well according to one story that ive read arnold used to say that lou had a better natural physique that if he arnold had it hed be unstoppable so arnold would sidle up to lou at a competition and pretend to flatter him by talking about how much hed improved and how he was almost perfect just needed another year or two to perfect his form and lou would blow the poseoff having been completely psyched out by arnie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is there any three breasted ladies in the book
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow this is nuts im listening to this random comedy podcast and as i was reading your comment and read total recall they said the same it must be a sign
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they even made a movie out of that book called total recall
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how long did it take to read httpsyoutubeifmozcnolew
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,also when lou finally came to spotlight arnold retired
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold is basically only what he is because he was so good at posing he has a great physique and likely the greatest chest of all time but he has many many flaws much more than you would expect somebody with as much notoriety for being muscular to have if you look at his you can see he has uneven bicep insertions see how his right one is more ball shaped while his left is longer thats negative but you dont ever really see him strike this pose especially on stage its usually one bicep at a time because he knew it was a weak point of his to show both biceps also he had a very compared to other bodybuilders he was nicknamed the austrian oak but you hardly ever see him pose head on hes almost always in a quarter or half turn pose a half turn would causes his waist to look smaller while making his chest look larger giving the illusion of an even more drastically small waist i just find it very inspiring for somebody who on paper wasnt exactly the best of the best ever to become one of the best of the best ever
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,story of my life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe its just me but lou looks way scarier than arnie in this photo just the sheer natural size of him his hands his weight his height
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cloud fitness because thats my goal physique
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont follow bodybuilding but know a guy that used to compete at a high level and said goals have changed in body shape since arnolds days in the past a small waist and giant shoulders was a primary goal today the stomach muscles are much larger ps the source mentioned above is in his mid in great shape still doing over a over hundred situps push ups and leg lifts everyday he started doing steroids in his late and has never stopped he claims it is like any other drug if you abuse it its a disaster if not there are benefits
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hulk most of the time lou was a lbs scientist but arnold pissed him off
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,goddamnit frank
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont think his ex wife would agree
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its coming the name of the movie will most likely be triplets eddie murphy rumoured as the third sibling
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,grrrrrrr aaaaaah grrrrrrrr aaaaahhhhhhh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i met him last year hes my height
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah id say about a pic of him being told hes shorter than expected from lewis hamilton whos
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was or but losing an inch by is totally possible
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive heard the same thing from a friend of mine who met him my friend was and he said arnie was at best
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre right he upped his stats as many celebrities do definitely not over feet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,of guys ive met who claimed or was in reality in the to range
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you got it jobin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in this instance its actually david banner sir
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its the drugs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who isnt even that hot his wife was hotter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well he got the quote wrong you cant blame the guy for not realizing it was a direct reference
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its the drugs they take insulinhgh possibly someone with more knowwhat can step in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,joe weider and his wife helped plenty of people in addition to founding muscle and fitness flex mens fitness and shape magazines joe together with ben and betty created the ifbb the mr olympia contest and helped discover arnold joe would help out struggling bodyduilders all the time with cash weights and equipment supplements paid bylines in his magazines paid photo shoots and product endorsement deals for his weider brand of supplements now known as schiff brand joe almost singe handedly built pro bodybuilding into what it is today joe and betty were also philanthropists including giving million to the university of texas austin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theyre just old in that pic ben lived to joe to
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if hulk was hulk today and hulk cloning machine you hold world hostage with hulk clone hulk unlimited hulk what hold hostage with exchange for hulk hulk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,may have gotten shorter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im and when i shook his hand i swear he looked like a dwarf short and stout
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably is now but people tend to shrink with age would be reasonable to assume has lost an inch or two since his prime
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its like he could be a professional actor someday
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he has acromegaly a condition caused by a pituitary tumor that contributed to his size people with acromegaly usually have enlarged jaws chins and foreheads andre the giant had the same condition
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his head must weigh fifty pounds on its own imagine the size of his balls imagine getting into a fight with the fucker
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah i just watched that movie they used camera angles to make him slightly less huge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was also a professional wrestler for wwe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he could have given shaq and it looks like he could
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,aw why because hes tall andre was tall and apparently one of the gentlest people you could meet appearances arent everything
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wrong version the other person is talking about the remake with adam sandler not the burt reynolds version kiel is massive though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,world heavyweight champion and they created the punjabi prison match to be his signature gimmick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres even a website dedicated to his height httpwwwarnoldheightcom
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou is obviously more than taller than arnold from the picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that plus the fact everyone knows the earth is flat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he is an old man at this point might have lost a few inches over the years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,weights have been proven to not be good for your spine resistance training increases bone density and connective tissue strength huge amounts of hormones and repeated impacts are what make former athletes diego senile in their
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know why that was so funny
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yea i mean look at the picture op posted arnold and lou look healthy and that is a word i feel is not widely used to describe bodybuilders these days
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats a large reason why the aesthetic division of bodybuilding has grown so immensely as of late
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those guys bc not pct
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they all use steroids and they all use pretty high doses at that high of a level im not exactly what the point of your post is theres only one ronnie coleman only one guy who deadlifted lbs for reps weeks out of the olympia only one guy who db pressed lb dbs for reps with a smile on his face only one guy who made dexter jacksonhighest ifbb wins out of anyone go so we fighting for second huh after looking at him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pumping iron isnt really a documentary its really just a movie shot to look like a documentary most of it is completely scripted
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,aka docudrama
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they were going buddies your best friend is your gym buddy of your battle buddy true story
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i remember reading somewhere that arnie would come up to a competitor and be amazed at how great they looked saying oh man your biceps are insane and your pecs look great the judges will be too busy looking at your chest to even notice your shoulders so dont worry about it and that would be just enough to make the guy selfconscious and throw him off his game
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,didnt he also tell him that judges liked it if you screamed while posing knowing full well it would be off putting to the judges
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,didnt he use to get lou shit faced drunk the night before too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you see him talk about this and actually do it on camera in pumping iron arnold is actually a huge dick in that documentary the guy was so extremely competitive he had no problem fucking with all of the other body builders giving them bad advice trying to belittle them to make them insecure etc
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i read that after pumping iron lous father told him to move out for being a loser you can tell in the docu that lou had some challenges with his father and his hearing and that you wish he got a fairer deal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mm mm mm baby you make me wish i had three hands
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,get your ass to spacex
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was it good job brain i just listened to an episode of that podcast with total recall in it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,when us older folk were kids we read books too but we diddnt go on the www because it was still made of books
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah well hes big dude arnold was always better cut better proportioned and better posed lou looks like hed tear arnolds arms out of their sockets but arnold really did a great job of selfsculpture if it was about being the biggest and strongest power lifters would rule them all right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bear in mind that theres probably not a single photo of arnie in this era that hes not flexing or tending ferigno was new to the scene and arnie took full advantage to beat him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,with her turkey neck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was just mouthing off but holy shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you also shrink with age and the dude is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandpa passed at he lost about inches in the last years of his life totally possible
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,everybody shrinks my dad used to be tall now hes in his and stands at about considering how much time arnold has spent squating in his life makes sense
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not to mention after years of cartilagecrushing weight lifting and rampant steroid use yea losing an inch or two is understandable
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fuck ive lost almost inches since im only in my have never roided or powerlifted
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes now thats pretty realistic my grandpop lost about or inches so far but hes on his
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as someone whos why would anyone lie about something that is easily disprovable anytime you walk near one of those gas station camera heightbars or is this on tinder profiles cause that might be the fact that every disgusting warpig on tinder feels like they deserve a devoted adonis despite having no redeeming qualities of their own but they settle for a minimum of
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holk smish
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why the fuck would anyone get in a fight with lou ferrigno
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,because bruce sounded way too gay apparently
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,david bruce banner i think
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its absolutely the drugs theres no doubt about that im just saying that its not only the drugs we know a lot more about how the body works than they did back then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,two reasons he married her political connections having children with jaws that could cut through pavement
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it is indeed the hgh it causes the abdominal muscles and also the intestines to grow which gives the bulging out look
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how many hulks could a terminator hulk terminate if a terminator hulk could terminate hulks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whenever he comes up in rfitness theres talk that his height was exaggerated in competition no idea what the level of veracity there is to that though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe because he is years old
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,amazingly enough he doesnt deliver lines much better on screen than he does in this interview worse almost
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i mean i know shaq is big but im always shocked when i see the comps
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i like how he and shaq are so gently holding hands with each other like little kids
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,weird to see skinny shaq i forgot he used to be shaq diesel
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not sure if theyre trying to hold hands or not trying to hold hands
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think it has more to do with potential than actual demeanor a guy built like that at even if hes the nicest guy you ever met could turn you into a pretzel if you pissed him off and there would be nothing you could do about it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i just wasted minutes of my life reading that website thank you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no hes not the top of arnolds head is right where lous forehead is if you adjust for the camera angle lou is built a lot wider than arnold but hes not that much taller id say about inches taller
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,retired jpg
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im dead
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yea i mean look at the picture op posted arnold and lou look healthy healthy both are bigger then what is naturally possible i agree that both still looked kinda aesthetic but they were monsters nevertheless
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,healthy their bodies only look like that due to barrels of steroids its simply not possible naturally
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,especially since arnold denounced the current state of bodybuilding he said no one looks at these guys and wants to be like them someone should see a bodybuilder on the beach and say i want to look like that guy the columbos schwarzeneggers zanes and ferignos were definitely the most aesthetic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol rsteroids coming out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in the gym im cumming on the stage im cumming im cumming everywhere
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,massive exaggeration some of it was dramatized
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lou and arn were buddies and were in business together aside from bodybuilding they made big bucks doing housing work try listening to tim ferriss podcast episode with schwarzenegger as guest edit it was franco columbo not lou that was arnolds partner in the in the construction work thanks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,same thing with king of kong and the dude with his own hot sauce brand
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,english is not your buddy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,haha what a genius
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its really weird to think that you can pysch someone out of posing well enough i mean i guess its possible just doesnt seem like its the same as sinking a ft putt or hitting a clutch free throw
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,haha i read your quotes in his voice
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he didnt tell lou that the story arnold told was that someone on the smaller side came up to him at a gym abroad saying he wanted to win mr munich and asked for pointers thats when arnold said the latest posing trend in the us was to scream while posing high pitched when youre posing your upper body and low pitched for your lower body
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is such a classic move that if its true thats all lous fault
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so i could give themthree thumbs down
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and bring the rest of yourself too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,strongmen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats going to be terrible i cant wait
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as a short man im not looking forward to this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i lost inches when i met ops mom
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,steroid use and weightlifting dont make you shorter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats not normal do you have any unexplained ailments
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,do u have scoliosis or something
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude most action heros are short as fuck and the movies make them look tall this is the most likely explanation van damn and stalone are fucking midgets
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as someone whos id love for anyone to ever believe i was
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,because of the cultural expectation of that magical number the percentage of people over feet tall is smaller than most people guess httpwwwiwonderifyouareouttherecom
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i especially love it when said warpigs are only selfhating short people relevant
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bit of an assumption
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think you also need to consider the reverse ie people who might be an inch or taller who decide they are taller ergo the other person is much shorter ive had people tell me im not because they are but i am edit yeah i think you make the point in your other post your brother noticeably taller but just i think many overestimate because of that and decide its because its noticeable so you know unless these people stood back to back with arnie id take with a big pinch of salt their estimates that said when people ask me my height i always joke that im on the internet there seems to be a disproportionate number of people on the internet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,btw his daughter katherine is smoking
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its possible competitors fub their stats all the time to make their competition doubt their self even today danny hester mr olympia classic physique claims a certain height but when people meet him at expos hes much shorter i even do it all my life i was measured at but i guess i had on shoes or something because the judges gave me still claim tell girls though lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jay leno
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,â¢ the crimson chin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that big and the athleticism to play nba level ball
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shaq did things no person should be capable of
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,idk i mean like every other nba center
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres a reason lou beat out arnold for the hulk imagine if arnold had been the hulk instead of lou
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think lou looks better than arnold for sure but those two guys from look like their bodies are trying to squeeze their heads off
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arnold was or so and like in that picture how is that an unhealthy bodyweight edit til being lean and muscular is an unhealthy lifestyle thanks for the info dadbods i bet arnold absolutely regrets as a relatively healthy year old becoming the greatest of all time at his sport because using some chemicals the government tells you you dont have the right to put in your body doesnt meet your morals standards for health
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bigger then naturally possible maybe if you got your fat lazy ass off the couch and lifted some weights youd discover things that are naturally possible
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know why youre being downvoted even though we know for a fact they did steroids
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heres a sneak peek of httpsnpredditcomrsteroids using the httpsnpredditcomrsteroidstopsorttoptyear of the year im a bot beep boop downvote to remove httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbdvcfdiotcy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the sperminator
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a pump is better than cumming
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i couldnt help but laugh at that man xd
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,all i said was that its not fair to classify the film as a documentary and it isnt go watch raw iron if you want to see how much of it is scripted thats hardly a massive exaggeration and for the record i quite enjoy the film
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,some wonder if the movie even took place at all
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,coming soon i hear
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that sounds like franco columbo unless lou also helped him with housing work
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,billy mitchell was way easier to cast as a villain than arnold schwarzenegger though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah yes the good ole autocorrect making me sound illiterate i meant to say they were gym buddies and a gym buddy or a battle buddy will always be your best friend
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres all kinds of getting in your opponents head in basketball half of mjs weaponry was his mind games and shit talk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for some people bodybuilding is like anorexia they start out thinking once they get the perfect body they will feel confident but then they develop body dysmorphia and they feel even more self conscious no matter how hard they work they always feel too scrawny arnold didnt have that problem but he was smart enough to figure out that other people did and how to use it to his advantage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,look at any sort of serious competition and you will always find people trying to eke out the smallest bit of advantage because when its the best versus the best thats what makes a difference
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its like sinking your putt right after you successfully disrupted the timeline of them sinking their hole on one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats why you are where you are in life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,these are guys that restrict their diet immensely on carbs to lose as much body fat as they can as well as shedding as much water as they can so better show muscle definition it isnt that hard to get them all frustrated and thinking things they shouldnt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh boy obviously the guy was too new to be mr munich if he fell for that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reminds me of a story of michael jordan and charles barkley so the bulls are playing the suns in the nba finals and jordan takes barkley out golfing before a game and then buys him a dollar watch or something now why would jordan do this to an opponent to make charles think he was his friend in the game he wasnt covered by barkley and jordan played like a baller and went on to win the finals
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it was scripted to make arnold look bad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no no
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,usually an overlap of powerlifters and strongmen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think tall people shrink more
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cartilage compression as you age does id imagine huge weight on your back doesnt help it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes he has a tendency to bullshit online i like the reply he gave though maybe i forgot how tall i used to be after getting drunk at a party you can imagine him getting the girl into bed and shes saying thats not inches and he says oh is that what i said i dont remember it used to be inches when i was i think or was that my foot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i drink quite a bit have been obese for most of the time also may have forgotten exactly how tall i was when got a physical at if im remembering right i was am currently just barely over you sure its not normal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats what i mean my brother is hes noticibly taller than i am from to ft is like me claiming im taller than him people would know at a glance i was lying
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im sure youve got a nice personality
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im and i feel like id get laughed at if i even claimed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im just under so really just its pretty great actually everything in the us is generally sized exactly for my height i can drive any car comfortably reach a high shelf without issue dont have to duck when going places and girls can easily wear heels and not be taller
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,neat website im years old and left every box checked on age when it got to children have children dont have but want dont have dont want just unchecking have children cut my remaining percentage to less than half the way i feel about dating as a year old man is true fuck this shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so is his son patrick great genes i guess
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no he has acromegalame
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,richard kiel
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy shit that poor guy i hope hes paid well he looks so miserable
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he looks like the apple jacks cinnamon guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not the weight its the muscles calculate his fatfree muscle index during his best days and you come up with like a to everything above is scientifically proven to be unnatural which means we was on a lot of steroids as he himself admits and those especially back then were anything but healthy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its within the overweight range on the bmi scale its muscle but it still forces his heart to work harder and thats not even counting the negative effects of the steroids he took to get that unnaturally high muscle to fat ratio
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the unhealthy part is more from how he admits he used to eat dianabol by the handful back when steroids were legal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,saying its really just a movie shot to look like a documentary is a massive exaggeration makes it sound like the office or something
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hmm i might be recalling the wrong guy im gonna check up on it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,butt buddy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,unless theyre a blue falcon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what the fuck is picsgur
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shoot it you fucking midget
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah sorry if it wasnt clear my point was i understand physching someone out of a free throw or a putt i dont really understand it in posing but i guess it happens
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,half of his weaponry was his mind games this is just silly shit if the exact same words came out of the mouth of anyone else they wouldnt do shit the reason his shittalking got in peoples heads is because even in the middle of his career he was considered the greatest to ever play without much question so his words carried a massive amount of weight to say that half of his greatness is due to insults or head games is absolutely ridiculous in its hyperbole edit used a word wrong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres all kinds of getting in your opponents head in basketball half of mjs weaponry was his mind games and shit talk nope way more than half of it was being some combination of biggerstrongerfasterquicker than people who played his position his mind games had very little to do with it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,itt people who have never played competitive sports
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,everything is why everything is where it is right now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,screaming was actually reason for disqualification the guy came looking for some tips from his god and got disqualified instead
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats fucking embarrassing for barkley
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,with arnolds knowledge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,correct
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hang upside down hrs a day like the rest of us
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,spinal compression caused by weightlifting is temporary and lasts a matter of minutes after your last set of squats or deadlifts or whatever your spine slowly goes back into its natural state
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats why you skip squat day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,uhhh you probably just remember it wrong lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,leno has acromegalomania too bass tone from kevin browwwbaba
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn its like watching a prequel to nightmare before christmas about the living origins of jack skellingtons skeleton
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know in which world you live that you think lbs at is healthy the normal one this heightweight ration does not require steroids maybe with how lean arnold is clicking on one nfl roster yields me three players at and or over one is a defensive back typically one of the smallest positions on the field these guys are probably on legal supplements but long term use of anabolic steroids i doubt it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,healthier than cheeseburgers by the handful
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its like imgur but with comic sans
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wait is that real or is this just another space jam quote
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,career ended comment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i get you man dont worry
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont think levity means what you think
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,levity
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his mind games were just the cherry on top what made the mind games so effective is because he was so much better than most people every pro thinks theyre great and then this guy comes along and he shuts you down defensively and then wrecks you offensively it hurts keep in mind this is in the days where you had to play man to man youre your teams best and youre supposed to be keeping up with this guy and he drops points easily and shuts you down so when you tells you youre fucking garbage you believe it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,besides larry bird ofc
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bird
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,here is a list of stories and correction it was two rounds of golf and a ring
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sounds batty to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats also why keith richards cant be killed by conventional weapons
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,implying not walking around with a weight best for maximum time utilization
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but people can hang from the pull up bars to decompress anyway it is a good healthy thing to do even before lifting
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,blasphemy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is what i was going to suggest the obesity strongly suggests it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i feel like crops are being watered that havent seen rain in ages that description is gold
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,old lady on the right is feeling that muscle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the similarity is uncanny
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol are you actually doubting that nfl players take steroids i knew a couple kids in high school who went and they were using steroids at its pretty common
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,supposedly thats real said it to muggsy bogues in a playoff game as mj backed away from him muggsy missed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah thats a myth he didnt magically drop iff after that bogues was still a great player years after that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,comment ended career careerending comment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre right thank you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah bird definitely
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they didnt leave you home alone ever did they
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ur dad looks like he invented redit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where are the other wives
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did they invest in microsoft they look like they would invest in microsoft

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your dads hairmet is awesome he looks like he a first alternate for abba
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nah they learned their lesson the first time they didnt need two more movies to figure that out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shoot we would be living the high life if he had done that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,couldnt fit them all in the pic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shoot i sure wish they had
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know whether to be flattered or offended
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was almost in that picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just a few short years later he was rocking the perm
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes i would have been or close to it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a man of no fear
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ill have to find a picture of both of us with matching perms ahh the

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there were a lot of things we couldnt do in an but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact people often asked us if because of this fact it was fun to fly the jet fun would not be the first word i would use to describe flying this plane intense maybe even cerebral but there was one day in our sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at least for a moment it occurred when walt and i were flying our final training sortie we needed hours in the jet to complete our training and attain mission ready status somewhere over colorado we had passed the century mark we had made the turn in arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly my gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months ripping across the barren deserts feet below us i could already see the coast of california from the arizona border i was finally after many humbling months of simulators and study ahead of the jet i was beginning to feel a bit sorry for walter in the back seat there he was with no really good view of the incredible sights before us tasked with monitoring four different radios this was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital it had been difficult too for me to relinquish control of the radios as during my entire flying career i had controlled my own transmissions but it was part of the division of duties in this plane and i had adjusted to it i still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground however walt was so good at many things but he couldnt match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading he understood that and allowed me that luxury just to get a sense of what walt had to contend with i pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him the predominant radio chatter was from los angeles center far below us controlling daily traffic in their sector while they had us on their scope albeit briefly we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace we listened as the shaky voice of a lone cessna pilot asked center for a readout of his ground speed center replied november charlie im showing you at ninety knots on the ground now the thing to understand about center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a cessna or to air force one they always spoke in the exact same calm deep professional tone that made one feel important i referred to it as the houston center voice i have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this countrys space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the houston controllers that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did and it didnt matter what sector of the country we would be flying in it always seemed like the same guy was talking over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere conversely over the years pilots always wanted to ensure that when transmitting they sounded like chuck yeager or at least like john wayne better to die than sound bad on the radios just moments after the cessnas inquiry a twin beech piped up on frequency in a rather superior tone asking for his ground speed i have you at one hundred and twentyfive knots of ground speed boy i thought the beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his cessna brethren then out of the blue a navy pilot out of nas lemoore came up on frequency you knew right away it was a navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios center dusty ground speed check before center could reply im thinking to myself hey dusty has a ground speed indicator in that milliondollar cockpit so why is he asking center for a readout then i got it ol dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from mount whitney to the mojave knows what true speed is hes the fastest dude in the valley today and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new hornet and the reply always with that same calm voice with more distinct alliteration than emotion dusty center we have you at on the ground and i thought to myself is this a ripe situation or what as my hand instinctively reached for the mic button i had to remind myself that walt was in control of the radios still i thought it must be done in mere seconds well be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost that hornet must die and die now i thought about all of our sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming i was torn somewhere miles above arizona there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet then i heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat that was the very moment that i knew walter and i had become a crew very professionally and with no emotion walter spoke los angeles center aspen can you give us a ground speed check there was no hesitation and the replay came as if was an everyday request aspen i show you at one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo knots across the ground i think it was the fortytwo knots that i liked the best so accurate and proud was center to deliver that information without hesitation and you just knew he was smiling but the precise point at which i knew that walt and i were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say in his most fighterpilotlike voice ah center much thanks were showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money for a moment walter was a god and we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the houston center voice when lacame back with roger that aspen your equipment is probably more accurate than ours you boys have a good one it all had lasted for just moments but in that short memorable sprint across the southwest the navy had been flamed all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the king of speed and more importantly walter and i had crossed the threshold of being a crew a fine days work we never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast for just one day it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the has two cockpits and was based off the still cool af thou

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ernest goes to military prison
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandfather helped design the original stealth bomber cancer took him while i was still young what i would give to get him back for one evening to sit and drink good scotch and ask about his life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ahh this picture really takes me back i remember being obsessed with his aircraft and how friggin awesome it looked the things i would do to go back in time for that childhood innocence i would stop drinking cocacolaâ¢ for a month just for it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cyclops on top of the blackbird

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats jim mcmahon bears qb you kook unless thats your dad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is that plane at a museum when he is on it the only one i know of is at the los angeles air and space museum complex it used to have the drone on top of it but they took it off
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tea bag level
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i love that story every time i read it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that is my second favorite blackbird story as a former pilot and a professional keynote speaker the question im most often asked is how fast would that fly i can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event i attend its an interesting question given the aircrafts proclivity for speed but there really isnt one number to give as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to it was common to see miles a minute because we flew a programmed mach number on most missions and never wanted to harm the plane in any way we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed thus each pilot had his own individual high speed that he saw at some point on some mission i saw mine over libya when khadafy fired two missiles my way and max power was in order lets just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to mach numbers we hadnt previously seen so it was with great surprise when at the end of one of my presentations someone asked what was the slowest you ever flew in the blackbird this was a first after giving it some thought i was reminded of a story that i had never shared before and relayed the following i was flying the out of raf mildenhall england with my backseater walt watson we were returning from a mission over europe and the iron curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base as we scooted across denmark in three minutes we learned that a small raf base in the english countryside had requested an flypast the air cadet commander there was a former blackbird pilot and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty perform a low approach no problem we were happy to do it after a quick aerial refueling over the north sea we proceeded to find the small airfield walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat and began to vector me toward the field descending to subsonic speeds we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze like most former wwii british airfields the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure walter told me we were close and that i should be able to see the field but i saw nothing nothing but trees as far as i could see in the haze we got a little lower and i pulled the throttles back from the knots we were at with the gear up anything under was just uncomfortable walt said we were practically over the fieldâyet there was nothing in my windscreen i banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field meanwhile below the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the flypast it was a quiet still day with no wind and partial gray overcast walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze i couldnt see it the longer we continued to peer out the window and circle the slower we got with our power back the awaiting cadets heard nothing i must have had good instructors in my flying career as something told me i better crosscheck the gauges as i noticed the airspeed indicator slide below knots my heart stopped and my adrenalinfilled left hand pushed two throttles full forward at this point we werent really flying but were falling in a slight bank just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame and what a joyous feeling that was the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower shattering the still quiet of that morning they now had feet of firebreathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated in full burner on the tower side of the infield closer than expected maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knifeedge pass quickly reaching the field boundary we proceeded back to mildenhall without incident we didnt say a word for those next minutes after landing our commander greeted us and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings instead he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest flypast he had ever seen especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking he said that some of the cadets hats were blown off and the sight of the planform of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable walt and i both understood the concept of breathtaking very well that morning and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach as we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits we just sat thereâwe hadnt spoken a word since the pass finally walter looked at me and said one hundred fiftysix knots what did you see trying to find my voice i stammered one hundred fiftytwo we sat in silence for a moment then walt said dont ever do that to me again and i never did a year later walter and i were having lunch in the mildenhall officers club and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an flypast that he had seen one day of course by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows noticing our habu patches as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred walt just shook his head and said it was probably just a routine low approach theyre pretty impressive in that plane impressive indeed little did i realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories its ironic that people are interested in how slow the worlds fastest jet can fly regardless of your speed however its always a good idea to keep that crosscheck upand keep your mach up too by brian shul
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,expected a in when the undertaker i was wrong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ok now lets have the other one

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where are her feet then and why does the quality appear different when you compare the girl with the background plus her top looks modern

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why does the quality appear different when you compare the girl with the background camera focus is a myth people

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not sure why but i always thought picasso was a painter from the middle ages
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,behind him are apparently the early sketches of donnie darko
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wait i thought picasso was a renaissance painter goes to show how much i know about history
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks more like captain haddock

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it was colorized the original is in the source
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre not alone there are apparently dozens of us
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one of his most famous paintings is the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiguernicapicasso the painting was created in response to the bombing of guernica a basque country village in northern spain by nazi german and fascist italian warplanes at the request of the spanish nationalists thats a clue of the timeframe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that stood out to me as wellit really does look like franks character was inspired by it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,picasso was not a teenage mutant ninja turtle

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cigarettes are cool anyone who says differently does so with an agenda its cultural it communicates a rebellious comfortable ambivalence that is attractive and therefore cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the most iconic figures in pop culture history were cool whether or not they smoked more of them were seen smoking in past decades as it was far more socially acceptable but the smoking could have been absent and their popularity would not have been hindered people who emulated them wanted to emulate everything about them the cigarettes were just one more detail in the picture basically the smoking is not what is being considered cool it just so happens that many of those cool folks in years past were smokers and didnt hide the fact smoking became associated with those figures who represented what was cool but it is silly for anyone to assume that the smoking alone is being referred to as cool those who complain about cigarettes in photos need to understand that the entire essence of the person is being admired and quit focusing on one small detail
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,slavery used to be cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,weed is cool cigarettes are for chumps mate
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,weed used to be cool ever since the legalization its lost its dangerous mystique now that soccermoms are getting prescriptions its not nearly as cool cigarettes are cooler than ever because of the backlash against them at this point everyone knows it will kill them that is the essence of cool to exist purely in the moment without any anxiety or strong emotion whatsoever

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i agree but i also get downvoted for pointing out scientific fact even though that fact doesnt jive with our sensitive populations beliefs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they look really happy together

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lasers were in everything in the it would have felt wrong to not have them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its disturbing to me that so many people are seeing a picture of a child and all they are thinking about is how attractive she will be as an adult and a need for verification
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can confirm must be smoking adult by now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,symmetry and averages my face was more symmetrical when i was wee

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah we had the same decorator
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,posters on the ceiling interesting maiden really had the best cover arts and posters and i recognize most of the other posters motives but whats that poster right above the bed

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hell yeah m
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if i wasnt married that would be my room right now shes into nu metal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is the big iron maiden one a poster or a tapestry did it glow under a black light
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,had most of those poster as welleddie is bad ass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no megadeth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,eddie the head
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,now thats what a real room looks like dammit are you me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my cousins room looked a lot like this back then some of the same posters in fact very cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so i am going to go out on a limb and assume that you loved hip hop right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im guessing youre still living in that room
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think that poster above the bed is a blowup of a card you get when you go through the suez canal was in the navy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why no killers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whos iron ladle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you and me both lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and yet no anthrax posters huh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,up the irons
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like my uncles room he busted my cousins going through his stuff and told us to get out because the posters come alive scared the hell out of year old me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im guessing op really likes iron maiden
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wheres the judas priest poster
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this had to be the metallica scary guy sticker on the wall didnt come out till that summer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,early that metallica horned skull design between the two metallica posters first showed up on a cd single from then as stencil in the live shit binge purge boxset in i had both of those metallica posters in my room along with anything else metallica back in the day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you didnt have aces high on your ceiling
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im curious to ask someone who was really into metallica in their earlier thrash period what was your reaction to the black album at first listen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah yes from the live shit box set still this room brings back memories for me too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where the fuck is black sabbath
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,up the maidens
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i envy you sir had to take down my iron maiden posters because of superstitious parents
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so much latent homosexuality
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was just about to reply with an offensive comment but then i realised im a moron
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dio can you hear me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tenacious d
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,run for your lives
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is the one on the ceiling top left
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this may sound stupid but i learned how to sing the first verse of the trooper from my then best friend before ever hearing the song i was blown away when i finally heard it one day riding to school with him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh god
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,metal loide
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dtmfa eddie will keep you warm at night
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my apologies
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it was a silk screen and unfortunately it didnt glow under the black light my mom made me get rid of because it must mean drugs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes that is correct
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah i see
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,because maiden didnt really begin until bruce took over d and now im going to back away slowly after throwing that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,great catch i was wondering if anyone would pick up on that yes after i posted this i noticed the spray paint decal i had done and realized my title was misleading i did the posters as a teen in the and left home in the room stayed the same and i returned to live offbase while in the navy and took this picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,welcome to the party
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i am lost and so alone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh no not that one the one right above the bed on the wall doesnt look like metal to me some kind of sailing boat or something
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the trooper was a really good song it became a classic right away i lost interest in maidens new stuff after seventh son though in metallica after the black album i was also into anthrax and megadeth at that time not so much into slayer sodom or testament bands other people liked in my surroundings
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a teenagers bedroom and a uv light what cum could possibly go wrong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bruce is the man seriously but killers has some of the best maiden songs and killers has the best album art
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,with can i play with madness i even remember the type font actually the seventh son album was one of my first cds i bought i had vinyl records before though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh yeah i know just having a little fun phantom of the opera is arguably their best song although i prefer the live version from the somewhere back in time live album
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no thats not the one i mean either that thing below the the beast on the roadposter was it some nonsensical certificate of some sorts you get as a kid because at one time in my life i had my certificate for achieving yellow belt in judo hanging at the wall between all my posters big deal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its a certificate i got for going through the suez canal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,do you still have it somewhere
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your safari to the suez was the first thing i noticed got mine in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats hot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,decolorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that dress ð
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a few things that were happening in the united states in during the time of this picture mickey mouse club debut television show gunsmoke rosa parks arrested james dean killed in car accident bill haley and the comets rock around the clock sir winston churchill prime minister academy awards best actor marlon brando albert einstein dies
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this could be literally anyones grandma from the and it looks like one of the neighborhoods they built exclusively to be blown up by atomic bomb testing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,every time i see pictures like this its always weird that her life was just as real as mine her life wasnt a snapshot frozen it time it was a chaotic amazing vibrant scary life just like mine is today i guess i dont really have a point other than that pictures from the past remind me that they didnt know their future like i do
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reminds me of kitty from that show
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,year i was born all the old color photos from that era got yellower with age something about the process but this ones survived better than most great shot by the way like a time machine to an era that i just barely remember
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,close to accurate it was westchester area in la it was the white picket fence area where everything seemed nice and perfect its now a complete ghetto
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,on a very early color film doesnt matter what camera was used once color film came out one could shoot it in any camera that would accept the film
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandma is betty white
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh man i can totally see your grandmas bra
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,look at these classic cars rules
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,great photo im reminded of sanctuary hills from fallout
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what that street looks like today
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks beautiful
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,really looks like how my grandma used to look love it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the background looks like nuketown
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can someome photoshop a jeep in there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wheres the jeep op
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,on my first glance i thought she is pointing at the car with her hand burning
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow just like in la noire
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not very early for color
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did you colour cameras have been around since the early
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it isnt that early kodak kodachrome was introduced in and in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,obviously fake the world was black and white before
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god that looks like a good time period
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that neighborhood looks like the village in fallout prenuke
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so did they not have driveways in the what about car garages
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn look at those cars
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i feel like ive been there before you sure that isnt sanctuary hills
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is exactly the picture i have in my head when i imagine life in a suburb
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this gave me incredible amounts of edward scissorhands memories
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a lovely photo shes beautiful
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can we get a modern day streetview of this place would be interesting
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a great dress grams
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,check out the gams on that dame
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think her dress is very pretty and if a store sold a dress similar today for an inexpensive price is probably consider buying it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reminds me of fallout
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rxray
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did someone say fallout opening scenes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this was taken hours before the frantic race to vault they arrived only seconds before the first bomb fell and barely made it to safety with your infant father
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im observing the background and i find it so odd that it all looks so normal im always used to those black and white pictures that its such very hard to imagine a normal setting for the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,some thoughts is that purplish car a vw bug i wouldve thought the lot sizes would be bigger back then i expected to see cookie cutter houses in a row the houses are all different
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how come the color hasnt faded
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was she in the truman show
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she already looked like a proper grandma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i want that dress today classic beauty
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kodachrome they give us those nice bright colors
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arent all film cameras potentially colour cameras i think you mean colour film who cares its a lovely photo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,everyones taking about the camera or the dress of the grandma as a homeowner im like dayummm that neighborhood is gonna have a kickass resale value everyones lawns all mowed n shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,back in the days when fallout was real
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,needs to take better care of that lawn were mexicans readily available back then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sorry to be the pedantic arse ass but its colour color film not camera
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whys your grandma got such a fat face an such a skinny waist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bs thats nick offerman in drag
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebots older brother
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,uncolorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wish i could find more dresses like this i have a couple vintage beauties that i wear but i want my whole closet to look like this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy mother of god as my year old grandma actually appreciated the back to the future movies this will reside well you are great
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what gets me is that we are about as far away from now as marty was from in the movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that was when churchill lost the prime ministership for the second time not when he acquired it httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwinstonchurchill
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,autochromes are even older than that arent they still a very cool photo though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and autochromes have been around since the early there are a ton from even prewwi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpwwwsmithsonianmagcomvideoscategoryinnovationthehistoryofcolorphotographynoist and they this guys awesome
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,edit this was not tried to edit the title but realized you cant
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wasnt kodachrome for slides film i remember they had a really good colour palate
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for some reason this picture in particular sticks with me for that reason
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bullshit that is not a ghetto area
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its now a complete ghetto that sucks usually the older suburbanish developments are the nicerlooking residential areas today especially in places that still have their elm trees like fargo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reel mowers they work very good and are still used on golf coarses
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think its her slip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,her bra check out her ankles
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow how did you find that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hi im colorizebot i was trained to color bw photos not comics or rgb photos please do not abuse me this is my attempt to color your image here you go httpiimgurcomkinlbpmjpg this is still a betabot if you called the bot and didnt get a response pm us and help us make it better httpsgithubcomdannyvairedditcrawlerstreemasterredditbotcolorize
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i believe the hillotype was around from kind of a colour process
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe for only a certain group of people
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if you were a white male maybe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,carports were more common
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those are all apartment buildings the streetfacing side of the properties are narrow but the lots are long
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like a chiffon fabric the few remaining articles of clothing from my own grandmother are of this variety
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,learn to sew seriously theres a world of vintage patterns out there and then you can use whatever fabric you like i love seeing vintage patterns the size charts are way less flattering than todays but you can customize your fit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was about to type the same thing it just looks so pretty and comfortable and flattering you have to feel good wearing a dress like that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is your friend
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what did he do
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,closer to though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep its definitely not as great as it could be but as good as i could get it in the time i was willing to spend on it thanks for the criticism
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but they give rather low res pictures
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and adding to that snark im pretty sure there never was a color camera cameras work the same with bw or color film
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those cars across the street are from the mid so actually sounds right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kodachrome is a reversal film stock also known as slide film its called slide film because the stock produces a positive image after processing allowing people to mount it for viewing in slides i believe thats the answer youre looking for
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where do i sign to live in this ghetto
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for anyone interested this photos location is morley street looking east towards reading avenue in westchester a neighborhood of los angeles california for reference down to the secondfloor porthole window on the house behind ops grandmas head this area is mostly apartment buildings note the siding and roof of neighboring buildings its really close to the airport im surprised it hasnt been torn down for airportrelated uses
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive never been there but i opened google maps and dropped the little street view dude randomly around the neighborhood and yeah its definitely not a bad neighborhood maybe not super desirable due to its proximity to lax but i didnt see any check cashing places or whatever it sounds to me like the person claiming its ghetto needs to leave their lilywhite suburb sometime and check out how the rest of us live
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,forgot this wasnt the house my dad grew up in mostly in part that this was not ive never been here just to the house my dad grew up in which is now in kind of a run down part of town
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,do you really need to ask a question everyone knows the answer to
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,never knew the actual name of those only remembered it as a rusty push mower that was barely used
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah but that wouldnt affect whether or not it would accept color film film is film you can shoot film with a literal cardboard box
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well you said the neighborhood so i looked at the rooflines in the photo and then found them in the google maps view
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was this the one that had three lenses red blue and yellow i seem to be sparked by the name
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where is it id like to see the before and after
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,google street map it dude we want to see it now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i see is this la by any chance
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stop it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the fabrics on that site are disappointing ops grandmothers dress looks like a more luxe fabric
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yessss thank you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jeeeez i just popped in to write id kill for that dress pretty pretty dress
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,switched out the oldie car behind her with a delorean
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,closer by about
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres an entire generation at least of people who have no understanding of film at all its not surprising really so while it drives me nuts to see the words film and video used interchangeably its hard to blame someone for not knowing about an essentially dead technology
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,at that time the color cameras were stored in the back of the closet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,or maybe he meant that the camera itself was like three different colors instead of your standard black and stainless steel oh ho ho gotcha
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that has always pissed me off imagine telling a painter you must have very good brushes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heh photographer here my sibs used to say the same thing i couldnt help but snicker
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it is and thank you i remember when kodak had a stink about the paul simon song kodachrome httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvplsdxvaertu
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youd laugh but those normalass suburban homes cost a million dollars in la
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ops photo was taken at the edge of the neighborhood where the apartment buildings are located its morley street looking east towards reading avenue in westchester a neighborhood of los angeles california for reference down to the secondfloor porthole window on the house behind ops grandmas head
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this was probably early property databases say all those buildings in the photo were built in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gotcha happened to a lot of la and westchester is on the edge of much of the once great but now blighted neighborhoods
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its still a predominantly white neighborhood though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,family before gang now i think would be a fair assessment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,impressive that mustve taken a lot of time westchester is a somewhat big area
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ops photo was taken at the edge of the neighborhood where the apartment buildings are located its morley street looking east towards reading avenue in westchester a neighborhood of los angeles california for reference down to the secondfloor porthole window on the house behind ops grandmas head
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes its a neighborhood of los angeles near the airport
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah ops pic looks genuine most of these are trying to hard to get that old look
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the problem with this world isnt the dummies its the people that humour them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,more like at look at the brown house to the left with the overhang at the gable its the next building in the background in the picture behind the apartment theres another behind that the one you pointed out theres a tall building behind those two sidewalks are visible behind her and well and far more in the distance
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dang sharp work there would you describe this area as ghetto i know theres usually a socioeconomic difference between the singlefamily home section of a neighborhood and the multiunit dwelling section but even in those google images it doesnt look particularly rough to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,underrated comment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,trying to get an old person to remember the exact year of a photo is a challenge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you mean white before and black now trying to avoid sounding like a racist makes you sound like a racist it is what it is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah thanks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is a very typically normal and safe area of la i wouldnt leave my car unlocked but i would have no problem letting my kids ride their bikes around this neighborhood
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no its a neighborhood of workingmiddle class people the neighborhoods proximity to the airport makes it so that only people who cant afford to move elsewhere live there i think your assessment of the area is correct its not santa clarita nice but its not watts either the la times shows that httpmapslatimescomneighborhoodsneighborhoodwestchestercrime use the slider to see past crimes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you are the worst kind of person it used to be a family neighborhood now there is obvious gang activity that makes it unsafe to be there at night mixed neighborhoods are actually much better imo because intolerance itself is dangerous gang presence however makes things worse for everyone fuck you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cool it would be a decent spot for someone in the consulting world as well who travels for work every week and wants to live close to the airport in chicago a lot of those folks live in park ridge river grove or norridge which are pretty much midwestern versions of westchester los angeles
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im not sure about where you live but in the inner cities ive been in the gangs were largely black with some hispanic gangs mixed in here or there ive never even seen white or asian gang activity spare some of the white power nutjobs in the deep south but theyre usually lone whackos
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh wow are you a total idiot or just ignorant in north america of violent crimes are comitted by black people who make up of the population yes they are still suffering from what happened generations ago just like native people that were in residential schools i am of canadian native descent turning a blind eye and saying gang activity makes you sound like a stupid intolerant bigot just because you juggle words around doesnt mean that youre somehow not reffering to black people how about you identify the problem and shut the fuck up about it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh shut the fuck up with your holier than thou attitude facts are facts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,people with that kind of money and business would rather live in the singlefamily homes part of westchester
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive never even seen white or asian gang activity come to minnesota after a lot of southeast asian refugee groups hmong miao karen shan bamar and what have you came to mn a lot of asian gangs came about theres also some that join the crips more popular than the bloods in mn
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,orange county ca and albuquerque nm asian gang activity hotspots
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,implying only black people can be in gangs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this guy here is clearly the racist lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,agreed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,depends are we talking about these gangs my guess would be latino if its la the original point remains it was probably white before and now its something other than that which is perfectly racist and true the way we like it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,implying of violent crimes are commited by black people usually gang related
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes because i refuse to beat around the bush when reffering to what ethnicity most of the united states gangs make up it isnt racist to say the word black and it isnt racist to state they are involed in more violent crimes than any other ethnicity in all of usa
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,since when is the truth racist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah but its not as simple as my friend
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,people forgot what that word actually means basically racism these days is saying anything about a nonwhite person or group that isnt positive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fantastic picture what a time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,years ago and i mean years i worked in a social health situation i met an ancient little black lady in her home she told me her lack of much hair was due to malaria she came in contact with in the south a framed document was hanging on her wall this was the emancipation papers that were given other parents when they obtained their freedom from slavery i mean her parents
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,american slavery was abolished in would make this guy over years oldthats if he was born into slavery in i understand that certain territories took a few years to conform to the amendment but was this guy truly a freed slave
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he could have been a sharecropper which was basically indentured service slavery except the plantation owners didnt have to provide food clothing or shelter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,freed gotta catch em all
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that does not look like
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he certainly looks ahead of the time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,when you were a kid that was nerdy now that you are an adult that is cool it is called fashion just google the fuck google the early what looked cool makes you want to vomit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,back then that was nerdy now that look is cool with hipsters
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is your grandpa keifer sutherland
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres a picture somewhere of my greatgrandpa wearing these awesome sunglasses that are only shaded along the top half of the lens on one hand he looks like might have been a war criminal on the other they were some fucking badass shades
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats because you are a nerd now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,xpost to rmalefashionadvice
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well check out this bruce willis lookin dude
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol he has the faded sides on his haircut just saying as barber that wasnt popular with white ppl who werent in the army till the mid to late
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,man he has the undercut half frame glasses and bomber jacket dude was way ahead of the times
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bloodyface returns
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as an old man you will again realize how dorky he was when trends change again
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tbh his fade and that polyester looking jacket make me think this is a recent pic and that op could be lying

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gawd that dude was hairy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the only celebrity death to really strike me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,amazing how someones happiness could be so contagious only from a picture all the good moments and laughs hes given me is retrospectively projected from one smile i always find sayings like this cheesy but its the least i can say about robin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if youre hairy the were a good time to hit your physical prime man i miss that guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he gave so much to the world look those faces everyone is happy there is like this super charged energy of joy surrounding him thank you mr williams sorry you had to go fuck you depression rip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this isnt george w bush anyone else see that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i have the good morning vietnam album dowloaded on to my iphone so every time i turn my car on the first thing i hear is goooooooooooood morning vietnam this is not a test this is a rock and roll at first it annoyed me then it grew on me now i look forward to it even when im having a shit day its pretty much a guarantee to make me smile ive been listening to the album since i was a kid so i know all his monologues by heart back when i drank more i would leave drunk monologues on the voicemails of people i love
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i miss him he was a comedic genius and an exceptional actor
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,excuse me sir seeing as how the vp is such a vip shouldnt we keep the pc on the qt cause if it leaks to the vc he could end up mia and then wed all be put on kp
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i miss this man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,really enjoyed this movie i used to watch it all the time one of his roles where he was able to display both his comedic genius as well as his serious dramatic acting chops ill always wonder what else he had left in him rip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,proudly defending his own right to bear arms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats a picture that makes me both smile and want to cry at the same time few people that i dont even know can evoke those kind of feelings simultaneously
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh robin i dont think ill ever get over his death
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,robin was like a friend i never got to meet his work was such a force in my life to find out he was so sad that he took his own life was the truly jarring part of it for me ill never really get over his loss
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i miss you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dear god he was so hairy it looks like he was wearing sleeves i miss him so much though it shattered a little piece of my soul when i heard that he killed himselfhe brought so much laughter and joy into the world it breaks my heart that he got so low he felt he had to end it all
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god bless those hairy arms never feel self conscious about mine because of him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one of only celebrities i legitimately cried for when they died so sad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its been over three and a half years since this man left us and i still get super sad when people bring him up or when i see him on tv
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes the only actor i ever cried over upon hearing of his death
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if only he was as happy as his arms are hairy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we miss you robin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i just had a little pang in my heart god that movie is so good seeing his face in such a great expression makes me smile but its so bittersweet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i sure miss him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,glorious bastard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think the thing that most people overlook is how phenomenal an actor he was he nailed every role no matter the grade of seriousness good will hunting insomnia were some of his more somber roles to name a few
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so talented so hairy so loved
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god i miss him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gooooooood morning hairy armssss
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not to nerd out but i luv how well film holds up in terms of image quality just wow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he is one of the only actors out there i can say after death i genuinely miss probably because he stared in so many children films in the early i mean the dude is peter fucking pan i watched hook every day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what an incredible human rest in peace
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,look how much hes making everyone in that photo genuinely smile
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,man i bet he would have knocked a netflix special out of the park i love this man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,out of all the celebrity deaths his affected me the most i was so distraught that such an icon of happiness gave up on life his laughter and character was like comfort food to my soul on a rough day when i found out about his issues after his death there was a quote i saw somewhere that has stuck with me since it was something along the lines of the happiest people are often times the saddest
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for fans of robin give a listen to baggage by drive by truckers it touches on the laughs brought by williams and also the depression he faced and the similar battle fought by lead singer patterson hood its a stellar gut wrenching songtribute
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn he was a gloriously hairy dude gets me every time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one of my favorite robin williams roles films goooooooooooood mooooooorning vieetnammmm
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god i miss him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i miss him very much
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,still cant believe he passed away rip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i had no idea his arms were so hairy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there isnt a day that goes by that i dont miss this man incredibly his movies played a huge part of my childhood my father and i would watch mrs doubtfire while having tea parties wed watch jumanji on rainy saturday afternoons while playing silly board games and wed dance goofy while watching the chacha scene in flubber due to hard times between my mother and him we have grown estranged i havent spoken to him in years when robin williams died i felt like a part of my father died along with him it absolutely broke my heart rest in peace robin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it was uploaded in parts this is part one enjoy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats an old ass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it must be hard to be that funny charismatic and adored and yet still be so alone inside
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,great movie great actor and a great man this film really showed the range of williams as an actor the end was actually pretty intense
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,man i really miss this guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that hair his arms look like the top of coffee cake
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was listening to an older joe rogan podcast tonight with brian regan joe talks about one of his shows and later people getting in line to get his autograph he said a humble bearded man was asking about a particular joke pretty intently and didnt realize it was actually robin williams for a good minutes one thing that stuck with me about this particular podcast conversation is how they pondered robin likely felt the need to be funny to always be robin williams in all situations id imagine that could get to you after awhile
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was an extra for a day on one of his movies over yrs ago spent a couple of hours standing right next to him can confirm between takes he was on and had us all cracking up and he went around and asked us all what we did what we were studying it was really great and im sure everyone else there has very happy and special memories i didnt till just now think of how he mustve brought that joy to people every single day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in todays world where reality tv creates celebrities whose appeal rarely endures warhols minutes we can remember the genius of one of the most uniquely talented entertainers of his generation there arent many people that brought so much joy into the world as robin williams did
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i miss this man so fucking much
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i miss robin williams he was so funny i feel so sad about what he was going through
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,everytime i read or see anything about him im reminded just how much i miss him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn is old school now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i need a good documentary on this man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my god that is level arm hair
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i just watched a video of his uso tour in afghanistan robin williams was truly a master of his craft
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rest in peace you wooly wonder
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what is he
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,inspired by the discovery post earlier i see
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a great contribution to the world everyone is smiling and i know he made me and you smile too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,truly a hairy man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i thought he had arm tattoos
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he is truly missed the one movie ive seen of his millions of times was jack i had it on vhs no one i know even knows about the movie i love the movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he kinda looks like w in this picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there is a video of him and his hero jonathan winters on the johnny carson show its really amazing how funny they both were and how spontaneous it was
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he looks much older than there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bring the motherfuckin ruckus

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,favourite actor regardless rip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a smile on everyones face in the background
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whats going on with the skin on his arms so brown
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a hairy hilarious man he was listening to live at the met and being entranced by his manic energy even though i didnt get most of the jokes was a highlight of childhood it still hurts a bit whenever i see a pic like this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wonder if this was a spin off idea from the national lampoonsawesome movie he is a legend
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that looks like the guy from jumanji
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why does he look like george bush here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks a little bit like george bailey the australian cricketer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,robin was so hairy he looked tan
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nothing is more heart wrenching than looking at the man who made us laugh and smile go down the way he did
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i cant upvote this enough
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if he ever went bald he could take all the hair on his arms and make a new wig

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,congrats for reaching ralltop of the day top with your post nbsp i am a bot probably quite annoying i mean no harm though message me to add your account or subreddit to my blacklist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably been said before but robin had crazy arm hair
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,generic comment referencing the military
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i miss this man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,when he walks in the room not one person is not smiling
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his was the first celebrity death that got to me it was so sad when the world lost this guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,adrian cronauer is my second uncle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was a huge inspiration for me hbo late did anyone see him do death of a sperm
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like ed o neil
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i used to work at the theater where his memorial was held and was there handing out the programs yes i kept one listening to his friends and family talk about him i felt like such an interloper especially when his kids were speaking but hearing everybodys stories was pretty amazing that whole experience was surreal it still feels weird to talk about it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,every single person in this photo is smiling which makes me smile
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bangerang
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like young george w bush
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,great movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,after learning that robin had an enlarged prostate ms dementia a coke and alcohol addiction a heart condition and depression i really have a new understanding on why he did it and more compassion about it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this guy raised a generation with his content
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice bulge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one of the best actors of all times for sure
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,good morning vietnam rip robin williams you will be missed by all
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,miss you robin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to think a man that felt so much pain spent every day of his life making sure others never felt a fraction of what he did and that couldnt even make him happy we didnt deserve this man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you sure that isnt woody harrelson
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i honestly never found anything about that movie funny
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the jungles of vietnam were nothing compared to the thick brush attached to his arms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is it true that suicides go to hell
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this sub is really turning to shit this is a fucking awful post
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the way his mouth is open i just imagined him screaming unintelligibly eeeeeuuuuuuuuggghhhhhh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i miss robin williams
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,miss this guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was so talented
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fucking legend
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is it me or does it sound like an elvis presley movie in here viva de nang ohhhhh viva de nang de nang me de nang me why doncha get a rope and hang meeee
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he got so into the character of a vietnam soldier for that film that he actually became severely depressed and killed himself in real life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,top comments are all military circle jerks funnily enough every irl veteran ive met is either delusional with nationalism or is humble at this point every idiot that joins the military deserves whatever shit they chose to put themselves through we really need to stop glorifying rewarding and worshipping nationalism and warfare that being said id gladly get behind it if we solve to problems here of homelessness lack of healthcare and lack of education first then this would be a nation worth defending right now you fucking idiots are risking your lives for dumbasses that think the world is flat or jesus is real
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ok its a pic from the set of an ok but dated film wow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shave your arms those patches of scrubby hair are nasty im glad i have light hair and the sense to manscape where needed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i cant wait for his next movie its been awhile
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jesus the guy is dead move on
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we were lucky he was a comedian because judging by the amount of testosterone he could probably flip a car
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,til that my granddad took his daughter to audition for a part in a movie and he got recruited instead he played the gate guard in a scene where robin williams first arrives at the af base in the movie he calls it his minutes of personal fame because the scene never made it into the movie would have been awesome to see him in this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no military creases he is an unsat dirtbag that needs to unfuck himself and get squared away
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i know you are joking but you are given just for signing up for instead of in the af
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he did a lot of cocaine on the set of that movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,at this time in history two stripes would have been airman second class source httpuniformreferencenetinsigniausafusafenlchronhtml
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,funny thing is about the air force is ranking up past senior airman is slower and more rigorous compared to other branches i have friends in the marine corps who are ncos after two years i put that in quotes because imo you are not ready to lead troops after only two years literally impossible to do in the air force unless youre that airman who stopped a terrorist attack on that train in europe to rank up past senior airman you need to test for it which is a pretty difficult test and after technical sergeant you need to test and go to a board to make senior nco ranks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did you not see the trauma of war on his arms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,also no military creases unsat needs to unfuck himself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sideways for attention longways for results
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and hung or maybe its just the pants
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kent residents are advised to stay inside unless you wear sunscreen or are very very hairy experts recommend a class or robin williams level of hair coverage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i saw a picture of his son and he has that thing where the chest hair and the stubble meet in the middle of his neck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his arms look camouflaged
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hairy or manly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,even the inside of his left arm who the fuck has that much hair there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude mustve cheated at jumanji
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you should see his stand up skit on eating v arm hair could never be used so provocatively
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep me too ive been fans of many celebs whove passed but this is the only one that really seemed like a personal loss
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seriously i actually felt like i lost a close friend when i heard i grew up with his characters
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i still cant put into words how much i was devastated by robins death ive always wanted to work in medicine and cant say his portrayal in patch adams was the only reason i went to medical school but i will say i always used his portrayal as someone to strive towards helping others even if its something as small as a smile or chuckle is such a huge thing i also believe he has ultimately helped the mental health cause he has shown us that even the happiest seeming people can have a darkness in their lives hopefully it will help people to realize that its ok to ask for help even if their problem seems more mental than physical
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i found solace in him being a man with depression who could not only survive but make other peoples lives better he was an inspiration to me when i first started trying to handle my depression and then he died and it hit me like a ton of bricks it was a silly mistake to build my confidence on another human with his own battles but my god did i pay for that mistake with my own struggle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and steve irwin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he really is the only one that gets me genuinely upset like losing your favorite uncle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,me too i was buying a new computer chair when i got a text with the news had to file for a warranty issue lately they asked for the date i bought it easy to answer ð¢ð¡
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would only add steve irwin to that list myself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it struck me afterwards from so many interviews how much joy he brought people but still seemed to carry a profound sadness and loneliness its why his characters in good morning vietnam dead poets society and good will hunting to name a few were so memorable i really felt this loss one of those artists who felt like a friend you havent met yet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heath ledger for me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dunno alan rickmans death also really hurt me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and chris farley
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,about years ago or so was in a gasstationstore in mill valley had various items in my arms for some of the guys i was working with spicy pork rinds was one of the things i hear this familiar voice behind me almost whispering to himself not really talking to me ooh somebodies ass gonna burn tomorrow worth the pain i think so i turn around and theres this shorter hairy guy in full bicycle gearshortshelmet just nods at me almost embarrassed he looks away i get stuck staring at him because i am almost positive its robin williams but i am not sure finally he says yes its me carlos santana nice to meet you i laugh pay for my stuff and walk out out front is another guy all decked out in bike gear standing next to two very expensive looking bikes its carlos santana i get back to the job and nobody believes me a few years later i was fishing from my boat anchored just off angel island and three guys come sputtering by in a dingy on their way to an older grand banks that was anchored in same cove i swear it was robin carlos and huey lewis to this day i never told anybody because nobody would believe it anyway
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in most of the photos and and videos ive seen of robin williams behind the scenes everyone around seems to have the same reaction kneeslapping wiping tears of laughter he was truly a ball of contagious energy from what ive seen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i really dont think it was his happiness though his exuberance and ability and desire to perform yes but i dont think he had the happiness we like to think he had
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you should watch his inside the actors studio tape he just slays everyone for an hour and a half
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i must be the only person who never liked funny robin williams to me there was always a forced element to his humor something off disturbed robin williams hour photo death to shmoozy were to me the only ones that felt genuine with the former movies i felt i saw what robin williams wanted me to see the latter what he maybe didnt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,eh its making a comeback i dont think i saw a single chest hair on television between and but of course now the hipsters are taking it too far with their man buns and dirty father time beards and ruining it for the rest of us
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he had lewy body dementia depression is a common symptom of it though when you actually read what it might be like living like that for the rest of your life you really cant blame the guy for taking his own life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,depression sucks sure a lot of us deal with it as did robin but his decision to ultimately take his own life wasnt as simple as only that he seemed to be suffering from a rare acute case of lewy body disease essentially dementia you can read a story from his wife detailing what he was going through while leading up to his death here it honestly sounds awful and i cant fault the man for his decision rip mr williams
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ironic he could give others joy but not himself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,consider not just the disease but the prescribed medications he took to combat it known side effects including suicidal ideation
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks man now i cant unsee it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we must focus to put more education on the children we will god willing maximize the learnification
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mission accomplished
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it is time to rock it from the delta to the dmz i too have had the soundtrack my whole life and know all the monolouges word for word exactly half the cd was my walk to school then the second half on the way back for like two years it has gotten to the point today that when i hear a song from the film just in real life i say the radio broadcast lines in my head after the song has finished i just cant help it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,back when i drank more i would leave drunk monologues on the voicemails of people i love this completely filled me with instant peace and happiness for some reason i guess im sympathetically feeling drunk yous love for all those people you left messages for
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i once put that sample in the startup items of all computers at the place i was working for the morning of april oh that was a glorious morning
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,me too he brought a lot of joy into the world not many humans can do that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and if you doooooo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i never watched movies at all growing up recently having finished futuram i decided to put a movie on netflix and thought if its good ill stay up if its not ill go to sleep i had never seen this movie but had heard so much praise for it so i figured why not let me tell you good will hunting is now amongst my favorite movies so much great screenplay and dialogue between the actors he stole my line will stay with me forever rip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking couldnt find the words god has it really been so long
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i cant watch his movies anymore it hurts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the world according to garp always gets me ð¢
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,amen fortunately live on broadway is immortal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rmeirl pls help
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its so hard its just the worst
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,link plz
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its hair dude was crazy hairy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,because it is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it sure it i have more body hair than most people i know and robin williams is like a a full step more hairy than me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i honestly think he knewit was knowing the kind of death hed be facing with the diagnoses hed got that made him do it he didnt want to become someshell he remains as he was for all of us
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and mrs doubtfire awesome movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn guys take a fucking joke
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they filmed parts of jumanji on his arms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if you get this triggered by reddit comments i feel bad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres no use arguing with brainwashed nationalists they have no humanity left in their blackened warmongering hearts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes because when i am looking for critical thoughts on movies i know the first people i check with are the twelve year olds on reddit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not everyone needs your validation buddy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,real men dont manscape
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah thats actually how i got mines reserves gave me sra just for having college credit hours i dropped out with
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,four years of high school rotc guaranteed upon graduation from basic in the mid source did afjrotc from to got beat up a lot learned a lot was worth it even though i flunked the entrance physical
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those extra two years arent always worth it two years in a shitty job at a shitty location with shitty leadership is a very long two years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah but putting on rank past senior airman is a fucking pain in the ass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol i got mine for just doing an elective class in high school still signed up for six years for that sweet sweet bonus
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i got mine at a yard sale
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats not entirely true unless something has changed recently you get it sooner after tech school usually but its a time required grade i did a year and i was a slick sleeve though bmt and tech school didnt get my two stripes until graduation if you join the af with a certain amount of college credits however you can be in basic as an or even an
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that was my first thought about this picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,good night mork
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,willickers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the stripes on his shirt airman first class in the usaf
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats the first thing i thought of phleb for years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the marine corps is based on small unit leadership where every rank including junior marine ranks is prepared to be in charge of troops or peers at any given time an cpl has an enormous amount of leadership potential responsibility and is usually already equipped with skills to lead after you hit lance youre basically groomed by your superiors to be ready to lead as expected when if you become an nco when i was in as an i was acting shop and maintenance chief for months one time because my shops chain of command was me then gotta be prepared to wear that staff hat and assume responsibility sometimes grunt units have had lance corporals in charge of fire teams
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you have got to be getting getting to staff is easy most people do it by years one year past minimum and thats because minimum is only possible with btz and either coming in with or getting it with a year contract hell i never once studied let alone even looked at my pdg or skt material and made it first time i got it at years with skating by how you do it is by answering questions with the most air force answer bluer the better
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,plus its pretty much years bare minimum to become an nco but thats really just for the super high speed airmen most people get staff in years then you only test for the next rank every years after that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah years time in service minimum unless you get below the zone or whatever ive been a sra for years just now studying for nco academy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if its just the pants i need to find out where to buy a few pairs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,watch the fisher king possibly my favorite film ever made and see for yourself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fuck thats a dark pun
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its theits the pleats mm its actually an optical illusion its the pattern on the pants its not flattering in the crotchal region im actually taking them back right now taking them back to the pants store
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats an airman not a seaman get it together
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the bulge might just be a lot of hair
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,could be the belt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,man not many people mentioning your poorintentional choice of wording
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah the missing link
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats cute not only does my stubble and chest hair meet on the front of my neck but my back hair and head hair meet on the back of my neck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heath ledger was really weird to me also was super unexpected and he was so young
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,me too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jesus christ me too dude me too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,all the god damn feels
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i swear it was robin carlos and huey lewis all three of them were on the board of the same nonprofit so it is definitely believable
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i swear the whole world is this mans friend its like theres not a single person he cant talk to so friendly to him its just another day to us its the highlight of our monthyearlife
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for real i believe you and feel very good doing so as it is an awesome story
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heard joke once man goes to doctor says hes depressed says life seems harsh and cruel says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain doctor says treatment is simple great clown pagliacci is in town tonight go and see him that should pick you up man bursts into tears says but doctori am pagliacci
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,agreed i have friends who acted with him in dead poets society who said the same thing he was a great guy down to earth and just an uplifting personality which i think makes it all the more horrifying to think about his end this is a person who brought immense joy to those surrounding him while being crippled with deep depression the lesson i take away from this is that i should pay very close attention to the feelings of all of those around me even if they seem the least in need sometimes especially if they seem that way
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he did the inside the actors studio with james lipton a rigid questions that everyone gets normally the interview fits very comfortably into a minute segment or so httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgeadmpdjdby and he spent two hours and only got about way through they had to invite him back to get the rest it was as you might expect hilarious
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well its what happens in the moment that matters as ive said in another comment to us he makes our day but to him its a casual encounter but i can assure you that those moments do make his day he enjoys making people happy he knows exactly what hes doing its other circumstances that have led to his depression
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dirty father time beards is accurate i married a man who is incapable of growing a beard so i never have to deal with that shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if its making a comeback its still only for people with a small amount of body hair as the hairiest man anybody has ever met a fact i know for sure because i am regularly told this and have won every time someone has drunkenly challenged me to compare i can assure you i definitely do not have a fashionable look
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lots of body hair was definitely uncool in the pretty tough decade for me to hit puberty in that respect took me a long time to just accept it maybe early or so just in time for me to start losing it up top and get neurotic over that cant win
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its definitely making a comeback and as a im good with it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he had plenty of substance abuse issues and whatnot before that though right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you made me cry you bastard that story was heart wrenching
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow thanks for sharing that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,should not have read that sad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did he really say that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe the pic is just low quality on my phone it looks like serious melanoma lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rip robin williams
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heck yeah
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont get it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,feel bad all you want im not triggered and i doubt a soldier with ptsd would appreciate your lazy use of the term i dont see these soldiers that pretend to be heroes for completing a workout standing up for all their comrades that suicide when they come home no that would detract from the glory their brainwashed communities shower on them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,also i love how triggered is used as an insult now for any opinion anyone disagrees with s i think islam should be bombed off the map but you are fucking dumb to think thats an effective strategy anymore
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im not surprised that you do
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as if your opinion matters to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you got mines all they gave me was a grenade
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i served with a kid that said mines all the time i fucking hated him but he got kicked out for rape so i guess i shouldnt feel bad for being a dick to him for those few years i was in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah but if you transfer to active duty youll lose alot of those stripes also you get after being ab for months if you signed years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,name checks out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is so true finally on my last year stretch of the years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those extra two years are never worth it you make before you even know what the fuck youre doing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah fuck that i did thank god
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you can always palace chase and get out before years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i always recommend the shortest enlistment possible you can always sign up for more
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im considering a commission as a nurse most likely obviously my recruiter is gonna paint a rosey ass picture id love a more realistic picture i sure wouldnt mind being posted in germany or japan but i have no idea what the chances are i imagine is being phased out lastly it sounds like i am better off with a shorter contract and then having negotiating leverage and signon when my contract is expiring
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what do you mean you just have to be good at air force trivial pursuit source studying right now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the majority of the radio segments where he goes off on long tangents he was very high and did on the fly i would find a link but am to lazy and want to get back to mad men
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh my first thought actually i smiled
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yup the marines is a different beast airmen think that you arent prepared to lead after years but they arent the ones who are bread to fight their branch is run more like a corporation whereas the marines are trained that if your leader dies then its up to you all the way down to the junior marine as an i held the billet of an for almost a year leadership is instilled all the way to the lowest level
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god bless pay mustve been incredible lmao
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i knew quite a few people that made in their first years in the coast guard they were all electricians cooks or radiomen though for other jobs like the aviation rates or corpsmen it was extremely hard to advance
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,years months to be selected years and months to pin on is the fastest you can make it without some sort of step promotion shenanigans for saving a bunch of lives or whatever
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nco academy is for senior ncos fam
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pop pop
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you really want to see that disappointed look on her face when you get back home
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its weird that that movie has kind of disappeared never shown on cable same with oliver stonetom cruise born on the fourth of july but thats an explicit antiwar movie and we cant have that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive never seen this just ordered thanks for recommendation
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that was funny i dont think this is your crowd
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it will always be too soon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,from perth really hits the feels
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,er you do know hes dead right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,great and apt reference robin williams really is a tragic figure he made so many peoples lives richer with wit and humor but was a tortured soul himself rip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,watchmen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how the fuck is that a joke
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he died from dementia and the fear of being a senile anxiety ridden zombie because of that dementia
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that is so cool i bet your friends have some amazing stories its strange to me that sometimes the people who smile the brightest also have the darkest demons which is very sad i think robin wanted make people laugh to distract them from the everyday pains of life that he too felt even though he felt so much pain im glad that he will be remembered for being such a bright spirit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre confusing a little how lipton conducted the interviews the question interview originally designed by bernard pivot was just a little button at the end something lipton did with all the guests to wrap up robin goes through that in about the same length of time as anybody else just a few minutes of short answers to things like your favorite word or what would you like god to say when you arrive to heaven should it exist the rest of the interview was naturally always written to the individual guest and the specifics of their career i believe robin did his in one sitting but it certainly ran much longer than anybody elses and his episode had to be extended he notably spends several minutes running off on comedic tangents with the first couple questions in particular great interview
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the inside the actors studio that robin did was over hours one person had to go in an ambulance because they got a hernia from laughing so hard they had to cut it down for tv if you get the dvd it shows more of what was shown on the show plus moments they cut out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,way way before that he got sober twenty years earlier he had a slip in i think but hes been on the wagon a long time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think i paraphrased a will ferrel impression but he very well might have
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we must create a strong iran a stable iranone capcap one capable of rejectingiranian influence he did say that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this picture of him looks like woody harrelson do you not see the resemblance
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i got a rock
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did you have a blast
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hacks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you should re spawn as support class
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you say that like an does anything that matters
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if youre extremely lucky its definitely not a good plan to rely on
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,chances of being stationed where you want unlikely stay in long enough and youll move around but right off the bat youre probably going to barksdale or tinker or dozens of other bases you never wanted to see they are phasing out the current retirement but im not sure when since youre commissioning things dont work the same as enlisted some jobs have fulfillments like pilots that have years to do you stay in as long as you keep making rank i was never an officer so im not really sure how it works there is an air force subreddit that might have better answers rairforce
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,same hopefully the selection rate is as high as it was last year
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im fairly certain he gave up drugs and alcohol long before this movie was filmed the guy just had insane amounts of energy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who are bread to fight
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,right because you got btz hence the unless you get btz
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what the hell
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,good try nsa after yesterdays vote im not falling for having that on my history
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,something is wrong with my ipad because that link is purple for me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tip these dont work and pumps will eventually make you dependent on pumps
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,til there is such thing as penis extensions
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,okaydickcom
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive been doing that for years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks but i already know how i like to stretch mine
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how about holding in your orgasms until your balls fill up rorgasmcontrol nsfw
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i looked through your posts hoping theyd all be pop pop i was not disappointed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its also a melodramatic slog actually im the one who keeps it off tv because when i got done watching it i said i wish theyd never show that again
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,williams woulda laughed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not his fault
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy fuck williams would have laughed though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,doesnt change who he was before he died his footprints didnt leave the world
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ironic he could save others with laughter but not himself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he wasnt that much of a tortured soul he just got really sick and couldnt live with what it was doing to him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he actually used that pagliacci joke himself in standups
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,username does not check out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a cruel one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,when it doesnt make you life you know its depressing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks i hadnt followed up but found about that appreciate it

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heres a sneak peek of httpsnpredditcomrairforce using the httpsnpredditcomrairforcetopsorttoptyear of the year httpiimgurcomhyrzqsejpg im a bot beep boop downvote to remove httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,honestly if you are studying now chances are you are ahead of of sra best of luck to you and hope you get that line number id lean more towards studying your skt i failed to open up any of my cdc information last year i was mid divorce and honestly didnt give a shit i studied the pdg and scored well on it but doubt the info i studied helped never had an ahhh i remember this question moment information is so broad and expansive had i not relied on my working experience i would have easily scored the points i needed and wouldnt be studying tldr skt imo is better area of concentration but study both so you dont have to do it also dont marry women they ruin your life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he also fought depression and alcoholism tears of the clown i read a piece about him about falling off the wagon hard in alaska i find myself wondering if alcohol abuse might have something to do with it williams used to be a bigdrinking cocaine addict but quit both before the birth of his eldest son in and stayed sober for years on location in alaska in however he started drinking again he brings this up himself and the minute he does he becomes more engaged i was in a small town where its not the edge of the world but you can see it from there and then i thought drinking i just thought hey maybe drinking will help because i felt alone and afraid it was that thing of working so much and going fuck maybe that will help and it was the worst thing in the world what did he feel like when he had his first drink you feel warm and kind of wonderful and then the next thing you know its a problem and youre isolated sauce
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he went to rehab multiple times
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,depression actually tends to strike intelligent and talented people im a pretty cleancut smart kid i do all advanced work im in a stable relationship with a great guy and i volunteer all the time from the outside my life looks perfect from inside my head you realize its hell i barely manage to submit all my work on time my boyfriend and i although we get along amazingly are both battling with adhd and im starting to see signs of a depressive episode in him which worries me and his parents are going through a divorce i volunteer because thats one of the only places i feel happy and my supervisor has ocd so hes accommodating of my quirks my mother is denying me help for my adhd and mocking me for being a freak ive wanted to end my life multiple times it amazes some people but perfect lives do not exist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,definitely a marine
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pff fuck it im flooding mine with as much porn as possible
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the only way to realistically add some size to a penis is surgery and its only possible in a few percent of the population some dudes penises shaft starts a bit lower and into the body in those cases doctors can make a few incisions to sort of put it up and outwards so it protrudes more it could add inch tops and if you dont have a micro penis you will probably not find a surgeon whod agree to perform that surgery
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxymgogcjpg
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what the fuck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pop pop
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,have you ever heard the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,robin williams cured my aids right up with a lewd impression of mickey mouse
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that sounds like torture to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it was both really robin williams fought depression and substance abuse for decades but the illness came in at the end heightened the depression and really fucked his mind up and eventually led to his suicide those final days he was confused and frustrated and upset and in pain and in that chaos his illness pushed his clouded dizzy mind toward his demise selfafflicted physically but really his head was in such a state by that point that who knows what was going on his wife wrote a brilliant article about his illness and about how much it took from him emotionallyphysically as well as the depth to which it would often mess with his head cloud his judgement confuse him make him forget things et cetera either way i wholeheartedly believe that robin williams death was what pushed me to finally getting help at the time that it happened we didnt really know much about his illness and how big of a role that had in it so it seemed like his suicide was driven by his depression for pretty much all of my life ive been told by others that im optimistic that i cheer people up i make people laugh its probably the only thing that im good at people always ask how i stay so positive im positive on the outside because i want to make others happy but ive never thought of myself as positive on the inside id often heard that there was a notable yet unexplainable link between comedy and depression in some ways i felt i too was part of that same group combatting extreme negativity with outward positivity making others laugh to bring some joy to my own life i figured that even though i was sad id be okay as long as i stayed off drugs all these comedy legends who met their demise so young were usually dealing with substance abuse issues and eventually odd sometimes on illegal drugs sometimes on prescription meds chris farley john belushi lenny bruce mitch hedberg et cetera i probably hadhave some issues with alcohol but nothing major and ive never really done any hard drugs so i figured i was in the clear everyone considers me to be the positive person i figured i probably was then someone so positive could never really have a dangerous issue with their depression any fleeting morbid thoughts i had were only that thoughts no action but then robin williams killed himself the absolute number one embodiment of joy and fun and energy and positivity that has or will ever life hung himself it hit me like a ton of bricks robin williams was a hero to me an inspiration both as an actor and simply as a human being i looked up to him in both regards so seeing that he could kill himself totally shook me i realized that maybe im not invulnerable through my positivity that maybe the negativity inside was something to confront and not something to brush aside because the external optimism somehow balanced it out that maybe i should be concerned i started seeing a therapist after that and even though i still have my ups and downs i think im doing better im a bit more grounded now i feel i have a bit more control in some ways where once i was metaphorically getting swarmed by a whole cloud angry bees flailing my arms wildly amid the buzzing chaos i am now sitting calmlybutstilluncomfortably in an old lawn chair resting in the shade under the tree from which the beehive still dangles im not directly under it but still a bit too close for comfort maybe a bee or two gets a bit too friendly every now and then and wanders nearer than it should but its a start tldr robin williams made me laugh made me cry and possibly saved my life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i mean he had pretty serious booze and coke problems the guy was not exactly the shining example of mental health
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont think this article said treatable basically made it sound like he would become a test subject if it was properly diagnosed likely just would have prolonged his suffering
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lewy body disease has no cure knowing he had the disease could have maybe helped him better cope but the suffering would have remained
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well at least you had a rock all we got was a couple of willow switches and a burlap sack
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,calm down sgt johnson
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what about that scarab
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i heard thats the weapons theyre working on for wwiv edit wrong ww

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats all you get for
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rock
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im a goofy goober
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,with you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,true that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,studying skt over pdg is highly subjective and dependent on your career field intel people need to focus on studying those because they get asked reportedly about a lot of reference material they dont necessarily use on a regular basis if your skt is testing you on things you perform on a regular day you should do just fine with that test if you are not then prioritizing it makes sense
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,alaska brings out the worst in alcoholism ive seen strong men succumb to the unforgiving winters with no sunlight vitamin d is no fucking joke and a deficiency will turn a normal person nearly insane
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who the hell still uses wagons in alaska
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tears of the clown fantastic song recommend it to those who havent heard it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,depression affects everyone not those who consider themselves intelligent or talented
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not that intelligent people or those with a high iq are more prone its more simply a matter of being able to imagine and visualise what the world could be like and realising why it isnt as the main thinking animal on this planet we have an extraordinary ability to make this a great place to live to work for our interests and not just money and to enjoy ourselves as we better ourselves and the biggest problem is the ongoing cultural push for fuck you got mine africa starving fuck you got mine youre poor in a wealthy society fuck you got mine feeling depressed here take these pills because fuck you the root of the problem doesnt make me money fuck you got mine
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah im gonna start doing that too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep brazilian fart porn it is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that last sounds tupac heard were
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pop pop magnitude pop pop
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i thought not its not a story the happy normies would tell you its a meirl legend darth robin was a dark lord of the sith suicidal depression so powerful and so wise he could use the humor to influence the human condition to reveal life out of darkness he had such a knowledge of the joy of life he could even keep the ones he cared about from suffering
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he did the same for magic johnson
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,appreciate the share everyone needs to be aware that depression never fully goes away it is never cured but can be managed it may seem like it goes away but often arises at your most vulnerable and edge you closer to negative thoughts i can tell you to stay strong but you and i both know words mean little at the worst of times draw strength where you can find it but dont stop at just one person job memory hobby etc as we need to keep searching to not just be alive but to live passionately
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i feel like this post really struck a chord with you i am happy that you vented and that was beautiful to read thank you for sharing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hate that i can only upvote your comment you seem to speak for not only your self but so many others and youre right sometimes the most fun loving happy person isnt what they seem remember that you arent alone and there are people out there im rooting for you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so did hunter thompson but i can guarantee his suicide wasnt cause he was a tortured soul he was in a failing body and couldnt put up with it anymore
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah actually you called it i dont like taking this view because i know every soldier is a human being that times just wants to do the right thing sorry i came across like an asshole im bitter because my best chance at survival here in the us is finding a homeless community that isnt full of drugs and orgies and getting a job that will barely cover living expenses if at all while we spend millions on new military tech that clearly doesnt work rightie drones
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ha we used to dream of a burlap sack and willow switches ours were so useless we called them wontlow switches you dont know how lucky you are
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,at least you were given that we were only given slapping lessons for weeks that takes years and a journey to slap mountain to acquire mastery you also have to journey to masters but very few can make that perilous pilgrimage

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh yeah im not saying he killed himself because of it it was pretty clearly stated that the disease he had was the cause because he was losing himself to it i more meant that hed been quite a tortured soul throughout his life due to his personal issues

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sort of sun lamps help too but you still go a little nuts without the sunshine until you find some peace with it the darkness is oppressive and depressing people who work exclusively night shifts get sort of the same thing summer in alaska is much nicer but you still need blackout curtains to hide the sun or find yourself waking up early to a beautiful sunny day only to discover that its actually am and everyone else is asleep theres nothing quite like that early morning flight from seattle to anchorage though if youre lucky your plane will be flying north when it meets the line between day and night so youll be able to see a beautiful sunrise on one side of the plane and a stunning moonscape on the other its breathtaking
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we just call it spring time in helsinki

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bamf spoken by a paratrooper from the he followed in the tracks of those at normandy and sicily as did i hooah
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that looks like a ford model a slid back on the frame rail to fit a first generation oldsmobile rocket motor with three deuces definitely hotrod
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was going to comment on the tri carb this is the definition of hotrod
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,awesome i consider myself a bit of a car guy but dont know much about pre cars i remember him talking about the olds motor though so im pretty sure youre right about that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those carbs would have been model strombergs on a special intake the linkage would be set up to run the middle carb in start up and idle and the front and back when you put your foot into it usually there would be some window screen in each air horn to act as a primitive air cleaner and back fire flame arrestor the idea back then was cubic inches and more inches add to that a stroke and bore increase swept volume and increase size of cylinder width to get a increase in total cubic inches of the mill a buick v with inches could be bored out to over inches and still stay together at rpms after that the valves were just floating so not producing any more horse power tire technology was way behind engine power at that time dangerous stuff at high speeds blown tires could kill you and of course no seat belts and no air bags either jim b
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a very interesting hotrod the oldsmobile cadillac and studebaker overhead valve all pretty similar then and made for a good swap to make that model a ford go fast looks oldsmobile because the valve cover bolts look like oldsmobile location and thats stock location for the generator whats really wild is the body is channeled regular hotrod but also slid back and has a nice shiny paint job and chrome also looks maybe like a suicide front axle to move it forward with cool wishbones and look at the steering gear box and rod location lots of fabrication going on there the headers as well a ford grille shell w maybe the ford radiator in it wide whites and steely rims cant place the hubcaps
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the window body was a bit of an odd choice back then as the window was the classic california look but i agree the car is boss and bitchin too one of the mods that some guys did was a overdrive top gear to get better gas mileage on the highway the lincoln zepher rear end had a better pinion and ring gear and stronger axle shafts and a larger number of gear ratio choices ford lovers looked for the mountain top heads that would fit the flathead engines they had a one and a half better compression ratio than the regular factory ones reversed front axles dropped the front ride height by three inches spring perches also could be cut or welded to get it down in the weeds jim b
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im glad scullcaps arent that popular anymore
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not berlin that is a london taxi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there has to be a joke in there somewhere

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,steve perry was journey ftfy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my bad but definitely wasnt thinking journey
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive heard people saying that my whole life what did they do that was so goddamn influential
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i really dont feel like listing all the reasons why so instead ill direct you here from a simple google search httpdarkhorseinstitutecomwhyarethebeatlesimportanttomusichistory some of the things they dont touch upon bringing eastern music to a western audience they pretty much invented and popularized the concept album they changed how the studio was used to produce music one of the first if not the first rock bands to stand against segregation they were the first band to go on a world tour and likely many other reasons i cant think of right now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,leos shirt is one of the most late things ive ever seen

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn that dude is ripped
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,isnt there a fish that has a light in front of them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes torching its a style of eel fishing in hawaii where you literally use a torch as light and you hunt for eels with a sharp stabbing stock nowadays we just use threeprong spears and flashlights lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hope this is how you fish in pokemon sun and moon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,doesnt have to go far to cook his catch either
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,anyone else having finding nemo flashbacks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he has a long reach
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gomad spear fish
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rphotoshopbattles
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like someone photoshopped a kids head on a mans body
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this photo is actually a bitscary hes like a human angler fish on land
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,id hate to see that on shrooms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dangerous considering needle fish jump at light
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seems a tad unnecessary
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lighting for the pecs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,at some point there had to be a bad experience with falling embers and baldness
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,night fishing fishing at night with the daughter of the dean

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,linsanity
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice repost from like a year ago
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this looks like a great set up for a shark attack
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,repost
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,everyone was ripped in the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a lot of people in hawaii are ripped in general not much to do besides go to the gym or outdoor activities source born there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes because being active was a thing then no internet or cellphones and little to no fast food we did this to ourselves america you are fat because you decided to be sorry but the truth hurts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he probably surfed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,same
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep anglerfish
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,or floundering here in aus
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you need the midnight torch to fish at night
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its already on the all time posts hard to miss
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i believe it was someones grandfather that posted here a year or so ago
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his left arm seems oddly long
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im asian looks normal to me but then white people tend to look old really fast
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,five full stop ellipses maniac
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah especially in a foot of water
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in my opinion i believe it is relative id argue that the pictures from the that survived into the century and our pop culture has depicted a decade of soldiers at war these soldiers must be in shape i would also argue that our sugar industry and their influence wasnt nearly as developed and i also believe our advancement into modern technology has changed our daily lives into a more leisure relaxed environment for the most of us we never have to worry about rations or bomb sirens fitness has turned into a social sex icon think about how many times you wanted to do those extra crunches push ups for that killer beach body or you found out that hot chick in your class is into six packs now compare that to how many times you have gone that extra mile because you knew you might have to protect your family from a soldier breaking down your door to kill them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did they lift weights
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,captain crunch hadnt been invented yet oops all berries ripped abs to rip abs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he probably worked in a cane field
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to defeat your enemy you must become him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,coincidentally this guy is the basis for the only superhero out of hawaii his name the anglerfish
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gigging in america you can gig fish usually flounder or gig bullfrogs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he clearly has two feet in the water
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,of shark attacks happen in shallow water no shit thats where all the people are
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fitness makes anyones quality of life better overall fitness shouldnt just be seen as a means to become attractive its a means of extending a high quality of life later into ones life just because it isnt required for the execution of most peoples day to day life doesnt mean its trivial complacently living in ill health due to a lack of a requirement to be healthy is a sad way to exist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sounds like fatlogic to me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,while all valid points you should check out the book sweetness and power you will find the sugar industry has been a major player in the world for over years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the sugar industry was very much developed by the especially in hawaii where their entire economy was based on the export of sugar speaking more on hawaii almost ever photo take during this time was most likely staged this was due to the new tourism industry wanting to paint hawaii as an exotic safe and beautiful destination these photos were the only things that tourists would use to form a concept of hawaii so the take away is be wary of old photos taken in hawaii as they were most likely staged
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hater
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and more jobs were just a lot more physical in the earlier part of the century exercise is really a product of recent culture when more people were doing more physical labor the average person was a little more fit compared to us sedentary workers who must gain fitness in special rooms dedicated to simulating physical labor
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow you really took that comment seriously
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,got it make an app that occasionally senses you are running and starts threatening you to run faster
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they lifted the bodies of their fallen comrades
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah that too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you probably dont want to hunt anglerfish with a spear
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i saw reel big fish at a gig once
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,duh dum tiss
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fitness makes anyones quality of life better overall fitness shouldnt just be seen as a means to become attractive i think understanding this is what separates those that go on crash diets and often times fail and those that live an active lifestyle with long lasting positive results people often times view exercise as a chore with a finite end point it should be viewed as a positive experience that you look forward to and is continuous throughout your life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i like the idea of being super fit and healthy its just doing it that im too lazy to execute
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,extending a high quality of life later into ones life well sure if you have something you want to extend maintain it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im fit but im not attractive i work out because i want to live a long active healthy life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this all day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thank you this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would say it was definitely developed but not nearly as prevalent and rampant in our daily diet and pop culture i agree with your points on hawaiis tourism i live here on the big island and the tourism is actually pretty awesome as long as they arent trashing the Äina or being an annoying drunk we accept them and their tips with aloha it is great to meet people from all over the world and from all different walks of life in their dopaminepacked vacations lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,calm your nips man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,vyvanse
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and tons of coconuts and bananas
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dont tell me what i want to do
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats the sound he makes when he trips
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,even more important as you age as your body starts breaking down keeping it in shape has enormous benefits to your health its important when you are young but its really a matter of functionality and bone density as you get older i wish more people were educated about it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey fibonacci what was the name of the comedian who sung i speak pidgeon thanks brah a hapahauli from laupahoehoe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fantastic shape same as in cabaya

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cause who needs an oxygen mask right hopefully he didnt suffer any long term effects from all that smoke
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandfather was a badass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did he win
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,beating the crap out of that fire
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gotta admit the pics badass and all but i only checked out the comments because i was expecting someone to say he was using the axe backwards i was pleasantly surprised
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,literally fighting the fire i see
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebot

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,background parrado and canessa hiked for several more days first they were able to reach the narrow valley that parrado had seen on the top of the mountain where they found the bed of rÃ­o san josÃ© leading to rÃ­o portillo which meets rÃ­o azufre at maitenes they followed the river and reached the end of the snowline gradually there appeared more and more signs of human presence first some signs of camping and finally on the ninth day some cows when they rested that evening they were very tired and canessa seemed unable to proceed further as parrado was gathering wood to build a fire canessa noticed what looked like a man on a horse at the other side of the river and yelled at the nearsighted parrado to run down to the banks at first it seemed that canessa had been imagining the man on the horse but eventually they saw three men on horseback divided by portillo river nando and canessa tried to convey their situation but the noise of the river made communication difficult one of the horsemen a chilean arriero named sergio catalÃ¡n shouted tomorrow they knew at this point they would be saved and settled to sleep by the river during the evening dinner catalÃ¡n discussed what he had seen with the other arrieros who were staying in a little summer ranch called los maitenes someone mentioned that several weeks before the father of carlos paez who was desperately searching for any possible news about the aircraft had asked them about the andes crash the arrieros could not imagine that someone could still be alive the next day catalÃ¡n took some loaves of bread and went back to the river bank there he found the two men still on the other side of the river on their knees and asking for help catalÃ¡n threw them the loaves which they immediately ate and a pen and paper tied to a rock parrado wrote a note telling about the aircraft crash and asking for help then he tied the paper to a rock and threw it back to catalÃ¡n who read it and gave them a sign that he understood catalÃ¡n rode on horseback for many hours westwards to bring help during the trip he saw another arriero on the south side of rÃ­o azufre and asked him to reach the boys and to bring them to los maitenes then he followed the river to its intersection with the rÃ­o tinguiririca where after passing a bridge he was able to reach the narrow route that linked the village of puente negro to the holiday resort of termas del flaco here he was able to stop a truck and reach the police station at puente negro where the news was finally dispatched to the army command in san fernando and then to santiago meanwhile parrado and canessa were rescued and they reached los maitenes where they were fed and allowed to rest the following morning the rescue expedition left santiago and after a stop in san fernando moved eastwards two helicopters had to fly in the fog but reached a place near los maitenes just when parrado and canessa were passing on horseback while going to puente negro nando parrado was recruited to fly back to the mountain in order to guide the helicopters to the remaining survivors the news that people had survived the crash of uruguayan air force flight on october had also leaked to the international press and a flood of reporters began to appear along the narrow route from puente negro to termas del flaco the reporters hoped to be able to see and interview parrado and canessa about the crash and their survival ordeal source

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why is lars hated
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the best metallica
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the decade of tight jeans and my man cliff rockin the bell bottoms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the bang bus
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,back when they didnt suck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hope no one ever pays for metallicas music again but rip cliff
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bunch aassholes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,false one and a half metallicas are on the pavement
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did they bury cliff in his denim
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not a single tattoo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just think these assholes gave away thier music for free in the early in the hopes people would share and trade it to get the metallica name out there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it should have been lars in that bunk
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cliff
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks more like metallica in a parking lot lars sucks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they have a deep understanding of digital content on the internet people need to give them a break
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that smug look on cobains face
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my first thought as well
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damnit i came here to say that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not only was he never a terribly impressive drummer to begin with he hasnt shown any real growth over the many years hes played music it comes across as lazy and possibly arrogant im good enough no need to practice todayanything new kill em all their first is a great album and the only work of theirs ill listen to regularly lars sounds great on it simple angry drum parts for simple angry music look at later works of theirs after the first or so and it seems like he almost got worse at playing drums his fills are out of place and feel random hes horrible at keeping time etc not to mention the whole band lost the aggression that made their music so fucking cool to begin with basically i dont think lars has practiced his drums in about years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,check out this how their sound would change had the drummer not lost it at times lombardo is playing so dreadfully evenly and fast they barely keep up but it sounds so much better
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know about everyone else but i dont like him because he was the public face of the poor victimized musicians who shut down napster
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,napster and hes not that good at drums
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the mans a pretentious ass and isnt very good at the drums hetfield is a better drummer also he was a big part of shutting down napster
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is that the bus that killed him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seriously
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,metallica has a drummer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes and look at them this is when they were already famous you think those shits wouldnt have downloaded music for free back when they were living at their parents houses hypocrites death metal up their asses
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i came here to ask the same question
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,came to ask the same question
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,before they got big with master of puppets they would throw out cassettes to the crowd encouraging them to dub and share then napster started after they started seeing large royalty checks come in from and justice for all the last good album and generally considered the last real metallica album so suddenly sharing is evil and dont do it and well james and lars are pretty fucking douchy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can anyone translate
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow it is cool that your grandfather framed it d my grandgrandfather fought on the japanese side and died during wwii maybe he had one flag like the one you have
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my great grandfather got one of these too though i dont think it has writing on it my great grandma has it right now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the top four characters are a wish for longlasting military success httpsenwikipediaorgwikigoodluckflag it looks like there are three more sayings or details in large print at the bottom and the rest are names
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im very interested in this myself one of my family members tried to have it translated through a program and got some really weird results
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and i quote konichiwa bakka yanks if youre reading this it means weve retreated and have left this for you ethnocentric bastards to translate sometime in the century because youve all become kawaii weeaboos we have been using this as a cum rag for the past three months may you eat without washing your hands upon handling this fabric ps we made the red circle by saving a few months worth of unfertillized eggs curteousy of miyoko our field nurse ive watched a lot of subbed anime so i can say with confidence that my translation is pretty accurate
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he didnt frame it i did when he gave it to me he was a pack a day smoker and this was buried in his closet somewhere along with all of his old army stuff when i got it the cloth was stained nicotine yellow along with everything else in the house so i framed it in hopes that it would keep it from deteriorating too much more also sorry for your loss my grandfather was a pretty lucky guy unfortunately so many others werent
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats very helpful shitstain
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you can call me shitstainsan if you wish ð
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey thanks for that i did time there too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so i was curious and did a google reverse image search best guess for this image republicans and democrats are the same well then

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sie means she they or you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ok ill go ahead and ask the question everybody wants to ask what happened to the flag did your grandfather keep it and do you or your family still have it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,captured flag points
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice one pops if you know what kind of tank destroyer did he drive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats one badass grandfather you have
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can anyone comment as to what all of the different flag addons mean
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just a small correction there was no such thing as battle for omaha beach there was the invasion of normandy aka operation overlord part of the operation neptune the tank destroyers wolverine etc landed after the beaches were already secured a day or two after the dday so your father has probably found that flag in the subsequent days of the invasion during the battles that occurred ahead of the beaches on the way to caen and the east edit plus at the fall of the allies were already at the boarders of germany way far from normandy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sie nazis autocorrect
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cover cocked to the side rifle slung over his shoulder and only the subtlest acknowledgment of his own badassness on his face this picture is fucking sweet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a lot of dead nazi paraphernalia on that flag good man

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i just finished reading d day through german eyes and have read a number of other d day books your grandfather is a total badass and has my respect the germans were so well armed they even had crap like this they would load them up with explosives and drive them next to or under a tank and detonate them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stole
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like he has been grave robbing like a madman for all those badges
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,since a few people were asking i attempted to id some of the badges httpsenwikipediaorgwikipanzerbadge maybe hard to see but if he was at omahaor it could be httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinfantryassaultbadge httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwoundbadge im in no way claiming perfection just thought id see what i could id
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,someone with skills should clean this photo up for op
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,best thing ive seen all day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i thought none of the dd tanks made it to the beach head at omaha
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,does that flag have pieces of flair on it cause i think that is only the bare minimum
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she nazis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,den
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fuck nazis im glad theyre all dead or arrested
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats cool as hell does he still have it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,both of my grandfathers served and one was a member of the infantry division which was in luxembourg during the battle of the bulge a tank advanced to within yards of his machine gun and he opened fire on it to force the crew to close its hatches he then ran to a nearby tank destroyer and eliminated the tank i dont hear much about tank destroyers from that time but im glad there was one nearby saved his life thank you to your grandfather for his service i wish i had some great pictures like this of my grandfather when he was in europe for the curious my other grandfather was a captain of a sub chaser in the atlantic he was part of the bombardment at dday actually the closest row of ships since smaller ships were nearest to the shore and then multiple convoy crossings to europe i have far more stories of him because he was alive into my teenage years but i wish i had recorded them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,post has something about nazis in it to the top
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my bosses father also fought on the beach that day he was a part of the tank division code named verify heres a few pics
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,from sie nazis if youre trying to imitate a german accent write from zee nazis if trying to use a german for the write den dativ plural in this case as in und hat eine flagge von den nazis gestohlen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is your family name badass because if it isnt you should think about changing it to that also im giving your grandfather the rank of major major badass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not sure why there is so much hate in this thread i have great respect for the greatest generation and the mental fortitude it took to go against an regime half a world away an fight them on their home turf
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,blue team has the flag
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i thought they werent allowedsupposed to do this because of the germans booby trapping weapons and bodies
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandpa managed to lose a tank over the edge of a cliff having neglected to apply the brake that was before he left england he wasnt terribly popular at the time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he didnt steal it he won it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,more like roldschoolbadass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can you imagine if that flag still existed along with all those insignias what a great historical piece that would be
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sell it to the pawnstars
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,do you still have this flag collectors would pay a fortune for something like this plus the medals and badges combined thats a very collectable piece of history my dad collects coins silver small antiques and all kinds of stuff hes not a serious collector tho he has about nazi coins most of them aint worth much more than Â£ Â£ but he has one thats worth around Â£ he buys them cheap from car boot sales english equivalent of a yard sale from people who do not have a clue what it is they are selling he doesnt collect stuff for its value tho and when he passes away he said i can have all of his treasures i shall also pass this down to my children anyway if you have this flag with all its badges and medals combined preserve it and dont sell it you lucky bastard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,storming the beaches of normandy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is only about as cool my wifes grandfather brought an ss officers sword home from the war i dont know the story on how he got it i like to imagine he shot the ss officer and took it what is awesome though is that my wife and i have the sword
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,savage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hope you have all that you could be rich i mean donate it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you forgot to add the germans nazi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the ultimate game of capture the flag
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,feelsgoodman
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the clapping sound of two giant steel bearings must have followed that guy everywhere
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my dad got a german luger after he died my brother sold itidiot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what he took a flag from the nazis the abomination you must return this flag to the proper descendents immediately they need restoration to be made whole again after our pillaging of the battlefield im a sarcastic ass do not believe this but you wouldnt believe the pc police who actually believe this garbage as if our soldiers taking things off the battlefield is as bad as the genocide our enemies practiced
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,from die nazis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you know it is hard to say anything
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hope he killed plenty of nazis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandfather was a among some of the many soldiers during the war to liberate concentration camps he had many things he took back home one was a nazi flag that he used as a paint drop cloth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this belongs in roldschoolbadmotherfuckers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wonder if germany has a day of remembrance too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cool flag and pins what ever happened to the flag and pins do you still own this stuff
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god bless your grandfather
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,getting better
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,is it just me or is every single photo of an american wwii vet the exact same white guy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandparents have a nazi flag that my great grandfather took from the eagles nest when they took it over apparently they said he did not write a letter or anything to prove its authenticity but i have always wanted it and figured it would be something cool to have a piece of history like that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandad is a hero and a legend i love him and i dont even know him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hahahahah the final solution
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,huh til that fell

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,badass as fuck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there has never been another generation of such average looking people who were such real life bad asses
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,uuu epic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah its pretty crazy i actually have faith in people and think that if necessary enough people would do what it took but who knows
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandpa is a bad ass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey my grandpa drove an too they probably shot at the same guys
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandfather too was at normandy i only found out a few years ago that he fought in the war and i found out last month that he was at normandy and did other operations as well he was a aa truck driver or something like that for the us army we found a picture of him and a few people in his crew i guess that would be the correct term with a nazi flag i really want to find out more about my grandfather since he passed way before i was born and my father recently passed away after we found the picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats pretty awesome my great grandfather was on omaha as well but he was with the infantry my other great granddad was in the pacific with the marines both of them fought in all the major battles in both theatres pretty crazy to think about its a shame i never met either of them they both died in the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its good he held the flag there because if he didnt youd have to tag this nsfw due to the absolute size of his balls
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not stealing if theyre dead
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the thumbnail looks like godzilla with a swastika
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandfather was a hero like every soldier who fought in the war on both sides i do not agree perhaps with the beliefs of his leader but anyone who fought for their country is a hero in my book
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably the most badass pic ive ever seen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like he got himself some medalsbadges shoulder boards patches visor wreaths and cockades too i really hope your family kept those items
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,love seeing these old photos thanks for sharimg

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandfather was there storming the beach with him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn rbadass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you part italian
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,does your grandfather know about world of tanks or war thunder both deal with tanks and try for the most part to accurate depictions war thunder more so than world of tanks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its a tough language but learning overall has been worthwhile plus the geothe zentrum out here had bundesliga saturday mornings weekly which are great to practice and watch football
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ach so ein leichenfledderer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,op any idea what outfit your grandfather was with exactly or perhaps you have other pictures that shows a unit insignia on a helmet or sleeve
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive only logged in to reddit a few times but after i saw this i had to log in and give this an up vote awesome
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are those stolen war medals
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,each of those pins or breast insignia probably came off of a dead german
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i just read the my grandfather bit of the title then clicked and genuinely did not see ahem that coming thought it was a bit funny everyone was upvoting a literal nazi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we can close this sub now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whew by the thumbnail i thought he was just a trump supporter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you uh you still have that flag looking to sell it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not only a hottie but also a bada
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nazi memorabilia story time like many men who fought the nazis my grandfather brought home a little plunder he must have raided a banquet hall or something because he snagged an entire nazi table setting tablecloth silverware candle sticks etc decades later when my grandmother was in a nursing home and losing her mind she started setting the table with that stuff in the nursing home which was largely jewish wed enter her room and bam third reich buffet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you can tell in this pic hes seen some shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,when theres an old picture of someone with nazi stuff its cool when i do it i get called nazi s
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thank you granddad do you happen to know what happened to the flag this picture would mean a lot to whoever has it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so capture the flag was a real thing back at these days
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,way to go wave that flag with pride no wait
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,say what you like about him but we all including germans owe this man and his ilk everything lets hope it never happens again
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,captured old chap you dont steal what you take by force of arms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for once i want to see someones nazi grandfather just once is there a brave would out there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hello it is highly unlikely that this flag would have been stolen from the germans with the stuff on it of course this is a flag made by us troops from badgesinsignia they have looted from the germans and made as a souvenir whether the items were captured from kia or prisoners or found at frontline depot i can name each badgeinsignia piece if youd like there are some cool things on there i can also give some tips to keep it preserved if needed awesome photo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to be honest theres a lot more there than a flag grandpa did some serious killing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a sincere thank you for your service ops grandfather you are an example for the freedom loving world
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,twist op grandfather was a nazi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,through the gates of hell
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandpa had a whole box full of war swag like this but it was stolen from his basement in the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,taking capture the flag to seriously
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bad ass thanks to your granddad for serving
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well my grandfather took the flag down at buchenwald and my dad still has it in the basement somewhere
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not in that uniform he didnt sounds like your family history has been heavily embellished or outright fabricated
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stole a flag from they nazis nice going
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,klaut der einfach die flagge unfassbar
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well he did not only stole the flag he obv looted dead bodies andor pows aswell ze germans didnt put personal medals or badges of rank on a flag looks like a trophy collection to me iron cross grade tankers medal infantrymedal east medal and badges of a lieutenants and and captain etc etc jugdging by the reichsarbeitsdienstabzeichen reich labour service patch smaller swastika under the big from the flag my guess is that it is already and he already entered germany edit fall is absolutely possible as us troops set foot on german soil at this point
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ggg good guy grandfather
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandfather is a hard fuck skull fucker youre lucky to have met such a badass where ever he is i bet hes still staying zero thanks for sharing op

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice free insignia
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cleaning my tracks with greasemonkey i suggest you do the same no doxing here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,now give it back
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how many tanks did he destroy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,might be cool but it depends what side was he on op
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he stole it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my father rip participated in the dday invasion his rank was tech i forget exactly and he was a winch operator he said on dday he was on a ship in the channel lowering tanks onto hover craft which were delievered to the beach heads maybe my dad helped delievered your dads tank
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,totally reminds my about that video on college humor hardly workingwolfenstein
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy shit where you think he got all those bars and medals from lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,okay now we switch sides hide your flag
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that is a picture of a bamf right there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reminds me of my grandfather its a great story he was a machine gunfighter got plenty of medals and some ranks after that a few years later he went to great russia well you probably know what happend there right let me explain it to you anyway many germans marched there and got trapped not many of them survived it wich is understandable even if its cruel but he took a grenade splint to the eye and was transported back to a hospital tldr russian grenade is the reason my father was born so in short grenade was not kill but life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy fuck im pretty sure your grandfather has an extra but in case u ever needed one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,reasons to take a picture of yourself this right here i bet your chai tea latte seems pretty stupid right about now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is so sick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,epic picture mate make sure you get in touch with some museums because theyd love to have this in or maybe just someone who documents these photos of the war
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ctf champ
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wonder if he killed sum goooks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you sure he isnt a nazi himself hence his flag
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it is ze nazis you swine
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,someone colorize please
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,double points for posting to imgur
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his expression says so much
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and now everything on that flag sits in a flea market antique store waiting to be sold
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats some manly shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that was my grandfathers flag you bastard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the very definition of cultural appropriation
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stole more like liberated that nazi flag america
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,our grandparents scavenged dead bodies for trophies that is so metal and way more hardcore than ill ever be
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and he helped to open europes gates for millions of rapist muslims great job asshole
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats so badass omg
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you sieves ve vant it back
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he didnt steal he looted edit sorry people but thats just the correct term i do not judge ops grandfather
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,all these medals and unit rank insignias on the flag he didnÂ´t desecrate dead soldierÂ´s corpses didnÂ´t he
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hope he died in pain
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandfather looks like an nazi supporter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he doesnt have a name hes just your grandpa now too bad he thought he would be remembered for his deeds now hes just show and tell
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you know your grandfather is a murderer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hahahahaha what a time to be alive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i always wanted to know and now the time has come to ask how can i reverse image search
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i get simbolo imperio star wars im not even spanishspeaker
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,huh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ops grandfather may have killed your great grandfather
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,here is a fun story i am american and my partner is german my grandpa was responsible for transporting german pows from rural northern france into paris and onto england my partners grandpa was one of these pows taken from a tiger tank up in northern france if they passed by each other little did they know their grandkids would be getting married its a shame they have both passed away
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pop pop the final solution
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my great grandfather was a german grunt he survived the war and moved to america after
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandfather escaped to sweden and made radios hohaah
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandpops died of factory chemicals does that count like if he made the bullet did he still get kills and the other dude simply got assists
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,id imagine there were a lot of flags stolen from a lot of defeated panzer battalions but that would be super intriguing if it was in fact it was your grandfathers flag
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,classic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hail hydra
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandfather was with the wehrmacht in in cherbourgnormandy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,german grammar lesson incoming sie you person singular formal used when talking to adult strangers or your boss kÃ¶nnen sie bitte can you please notice the capital s in sie du you person singular informal used when talking to friends or family kannst du bitte can you please sie they person plural sie spielen fuÃball they play football sie she person singular sie ist schÃ¶n she is beautiful edit just realized you are probably german as well doesnt matter op gets his german grammar lesson repeat after me ich du er sie es wir ihr sie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh not them i always thought it meant them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was wondering what that meant i was thinking he meant second infantry elite or some thing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no it can mean she they or you it can also in some cases mean her and them op was probably aiming for zee nazis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sadly it was stolen from him while he was being transported on a train sometime during the war he was not happy of course and believed it was stolen by someone in his platoon even in his old age you could tell he was still mad at the thieving bastard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im curious what game exactly youre referring to where you get exactly points
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just asked my father and he believes it was a hellcat or the thanks for the question i didnt even know that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thank you i completely agree
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i used to be into militaria but my references are not handy iirc the various eagle pins at the top would have come from officers caps most are armyss but the more natural looking one is luftwaffe the oval pins can be proficiency or activity awards not sure about the round ones at the lower left you have epaulettes worn on the shoulders depending on who you were they could show branch of service rank or even the regiment the bottom center looks like the national patches from uniforms and the stuff at the lower right look like medals including an iron cross that would have been one hell of a collection to see in person
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would say to the left the rifle medal is the infantery assault badge under it is the panzer assault badge in the middle a flurry of officers cap eagles the three helmet badges on the right are german wounded in action badges right of the helmets is a visor cap wreath with its cockade possibly further down lower middle is a hitler youth diamond patch under a nazi party eagle patch to the right of the diamond patch is a luftwaffe officers cap badge the eagle in flight bottom left top row two unteroffizier shoulder boards middle board under that row is leutnant shoulder board or the ss versions at the right of the boards is a ss cap skull or a panzer skull collar badge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i would like to know as well unfortunately no one at our memorial day party knows
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,top left are mostly medals i recognise from films and games the one with like a slant in it looks like its for participating in lots of infantry assaults looks kinda shiny too so if its the gold one its from stalingrad itself the one below with like a tank in it is the panzer assault badge the fact theres also a knights cross in there means these are probably all from corpses so not so much addons as achievements corpse looter being the main one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pieces of flair it was required to have at least pieces of flair
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was hoping someone else would mention this the inaccuracy was bothering me before
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the destroyers also landed at utah beach not omaha
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think he meant to make it sound like ze germans but didnt realise sie means they or you not the in german so it comes out they nazis or you nazis so maybe hes just insulting us all
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats his colt acp in a shoulder holster not a rifle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,from this i feel relatively confident that we just celebrated grandfather nazi day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres plenty of them usually a bunch of german pow surrendering you can find a bunch of kindergarteners surrendering in hÃ¼rtgen forest
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was born in so that should make him around in this picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,first gen rcxd
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the soviets trained dogs to do the same thing fucked up but it took care of the panzers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep pretty disgraceful having the flag with all the scavanged shit i mean ffs at least keep some of the rank insignia on the uniforms
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a lot of troops landed at omaha beachhead after dday op didnt say he fought at normandy just that he landed there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,all of the dd tanks were lost at omaha but ops grandad drove tank destroyers not dd tanks ops grandad also didnt participate in the actual invasion landings as tank destroyers didnt arrive on the beach until after the beach was secured
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is what i was wondering as well
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and all the nazi loving nerds who can identify a flughenschnitzel rank from a year old photo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cool pictures there was no tank division though your boss likely has it confused with the tank battalion which was involved in dday operations
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,madness when you look at these pictures and its kids every picture you see theres some kid in military uniform that wouldnt look out of place now in a hoodie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,surprised to see this buried i heard the same about this stuff
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what youre allowed to do and what you do are often different i mean on the one hand you might get blown up but on the other hand dad got a really neat medal off of an imperial officer in the last war so you might find something sweet in that abandoned panther and theres a lot of abandoned panthers so if the one youre looking at doesnt have anything cool there should be another one just down the road with thrown tracks or a broken transmission or something
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did he ride it to the bottom or bail out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they just got a lot of those in recently
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its worth ill give you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wut
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those are medals not just pins be wasnt just given them

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the ss were the hardcore ideologues of the wermacht and heavily involved in the various atrocities committed during the war by the nazis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you fucking kidding me the clean wehrmacht myth is bad enough but now you say the fucking ss who were all nazis was not fully evil they only existed because hardcore nazis wanted their own military group to do war crimes with
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,grammar nazi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,should be die nazis right since it is a plural
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sorry couldnt resist being a nazi grammar nazi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it would be from den nazis if you want to put it in german
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,were you thinking of zee germans thats just a joke about how germans are supposed to sound when they say the i think
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you dont say it like that in german
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes could also mean them if its in the middle of a sentence and has a capital s its a formal form of you used by example when someone from the us would end the sentence with sir would you like some more sir mÃ¶chten sie noch etwas mehr in all other cases good luck it depends on context and could mean she they or them and in front of a sentence all are written with a capital s germany come for the beer leave because of the language
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,welcome to the german language where every word is made up and the points dont matter
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes it can mean them too it can mean they you them she and her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sie is she or a courtesy form for you if you talk to a business partner or something similar them has several meanings in german it can translate to sie or ihnen for example you could say diese nazis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not according to the dictionary
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that sucks really badly im a german collectorresearcherand the historical significance is amazing since it has the photo to go along with it the flag along with all of those medals is very high in monetary value as well i see iron cross first class panzer assault badges ea infantry assault badges ss shoulderboards per board para badge wound badge silver ss cap eagle lw and army cap eagles and breast eagles ea and since it is normandy related with proof it would have been worth a large sum of money monetarily this is sad that it was stolen edit note the cool dlv shoulderboard too interesting that it was captured in normandy like that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there is only one thief in the army the rest of us are just trying to get our shit back
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tennis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hellcats jacksons were awesome beasts for their time thanks for sharing happy memorial day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in that case it was probably a hellcat since the jackson did not enter combat in europe until september
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what an heirloom my grandfather fought in the war and he said he had collected a lot of memorabilia lugers rifles medals etc well when the war was over the brass had everyone on a boat to be shipped home as soon as the boat left port they had a meeting and said when we dock in england all bags will be searched and anyone caught with any german contraband will be arrested and court martialed so over the side of the boat it went sadly he said not one person was searched when they hit shore
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey do you know what division he was in my great uncle was a tank driver in the armored died in combat and we have a pretty amazing account of the whole thing curious if this was the same unit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hellcat what is it with the american army and naming things the same as other things you have the hellcat and the hellcat then youve got your mortar flamethrower and machine gun and dont even get me started on the canadians they just take everything the americans have and put a c in front of it and if it already has a c like the they add an extra at the end too the
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he doesnt remember if it was a or a
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just curious did he get to keep the flag after the war and bring it home with him if so do you know where it is these days
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think some of the pins to the left of the panzer badge are tinniescommemorative badges sold by the whw winterhilfswerk there are some lapel pins or stick badges too also one of those wound badges is a legion condor wound badge for a german being wounded during the spanish civil war you can tell by the distinct shape of the helmet its the one to the right of the panzer badge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they look like nazi pins insignia badges rank and medals like youd find on caps jackets shirts ect most likely taken off dead nazi soldiers as souvenirs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it was bothering me too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was just reading it in an oldtimey german accent although im german and know the real meaning of sie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my mistake thanks for clarifying
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rc tanks not rc wire guided httpsenwikipediaorgwikigoliathtrackedmine the wire was trailed out behind the minitank and was vulnerable to mg fire it would have been more appropriate to call the tiny tank david but that would have required the nazis to name their tiny tank after a jewish king so they named it after the philistine giant that got killed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why the fuck would you want to respect nazi insignia
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you know whats truly disgraceful fighting for hitler

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i understand i was just assuming that he meant that his grandfather landed during the initial assault
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats my mistake i didnt meen to put that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its mind blowing that these people are my age they were going off to war dying everyday and here i am working and going to college its nuts same thing in korea same thing in vietnam one day doing your own thing the next your number gets picked and off to war
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fortunately no one was in it when it went over though the tank didnt survive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well he has to frame it and it is gonna sit around for months
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably riffing on something to do with the japanese and heirloom swords with year old mastercrafted thousandtimefolded blades that got confiscated by filthy greasy gaijin gis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,interesting thanks for the response
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh yeah wed be like jee quickly and quietly reset the table put the nazi stuff away then the next day it was nazi lunchtime all over again
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,depends on their condition euro for an iron cross first class in a good condition and as far as i can see this is the mst valuable one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,show the flag burning or something something where he doesnt have to defend himself against everyone lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jeez dude calm down so you think stealing is okay what an asshole
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn someone else got to it first souvenir swipers everywhere

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kamikamikazi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah as we all know was basically only a big game of ctf with very good backstory
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it looks like he looted a few dead germans too or the stuff pinned to the flag might just be what rained down after he destroyed the tanks german steel piÃ±atas sorry
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,capture the flag bloodgulch
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well im sure hes killed someone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandfather also drove a tank there they may have known each other
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude stealing flag not glorious killing german ss war criminal most glorious so reconsider didnt he killed at least few of them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,starring rob schneider as ss commander leder hozen
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this reads like gta ad lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if he met an american with a thick boston accent and a long polish name probably he was a very nice man i cant imagine he was cruel to anyone even enemies of war then again he was born in poland and moved to boston at a young age so he may have been touchy about the poland annexation and the concentration camps
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its always sunny in philadelphia meets community
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wrong show reference still a good show though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no no it just doesnt seem as dramatic to be clear he probably wouldnt been that bad of staying in norway he wasnt jew or anything else putting him in danger but he couldnt know what was going to happen at the time and the radios gave him a little role in the resistance
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but he made the bullet isnt that like a intercontinental punch to the face
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,idk he mightve been trying to assassinate a inventor and his wife on the way to a plane
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the ss werent part of the wehrmacht they were an arm of the party and the wehrmacht the army was also involved in those atrocities
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they said not all
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow talk about hard core denial you guys all realise that the majority of the ss were foreign as in not german or in fact actually capable of being members of the nazi party
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah it can definitely get annoying thats why youve gotta look at the verb and capitalization sie gehen they are going sie gehen you are going sie geht she is going unfortunately her and them can be the same and its entirely contextual ich hasse sie i hate themi hate her its usually quite clear in speech though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,found it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no that would be too simple after all it is still german and therfore its not simple its von den nazis he stole a flag from the nazis from whom did he steal the nazis er stahl eine flagge von den nazis von wem stahl er von den nazis the differentiantion is who and whom if its whom and plural its always den if its who and plural its always die i think this is the correct explanation but there might be exceptions im not a language teacher or something he attacked the nazis who did he attack the nazis er attackierte die nazis wen hat er attackiert die nazis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i believe what op was in fact thinking of is a heavilyaccented the as in the way germans less good at english pronunciation would say it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the dental fricatives dont exist in german so many germans will have difficulty pronouncing them hence replacing the th sound with a z
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,arent all words made up in all languages
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but but its such a mathematical language
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i snarf my family
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,diese doesnt make much sense in context here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,which dictionary are you referring to check a source like leo my go to dictionary when i was getting my degree in german and while i lived in germany ihnen and sie can both mean them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks i read the comments to find out about the medals
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why is there such a range in price from as little as a couple of dollars to up to
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can you tell why would then attach their badges to the flag
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im curious for german veterans who fought in the war what medals do they have now do they still have their medals with the swastika on them maybe for historical reference or were new medals made postwar always wondered what they would be wearing at a memorial day in germany
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,quite a range there do they have rare ones or holographic pins
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i love capture the tennis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes they were happy memorial day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,australian here is happy memorial day appropriate
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandpa came back with lugers and a a bunch of other stuff too weird
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so over the side of the boat it went sadly he said not one person was searched when they hit shore its hit or miss we had the same kind of spot inspection with prior threat when we pulled out of our ports sometimes they were bullshit other times they really did search it just depended it also varied from department to department if there was something available they didnt want us to bring back they would at least casually look i stashed some raunchy preinternet europorn in a hiding spot on board once and was lucky because they did end up searching that time but i also had a small glass hookah major contraband id bought from israel broken down in pieces in my locker and no one even gave it a second eye they were more worried about porn go figure edit wrong country
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how else could we fire an while carrying an while riding an
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not sure why you got downvoted but i am also curious about the same thing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,iirc drivers were typically pfcs or privates which would make sense with the lack of rank insignia on his uniform
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this to me was the more baddass part raiding the dead or in the case of hats discards
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they confiscated these from pows as well so the original owners werent necessarily dead
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,interesting about the name if you think about the technology available in the this is so impressive although they werent very effective on dday due to all the craters and the fact that some of the bunkers were overrun before they were able to be used but still an impressive and scary weapon for the time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it would have been more appropriate to call the tiny tank david its less about naming it after a jewish king and more disguising the project name the tiny rc tank was called goliath the giant fucking ton pzviii was named maus mouse both were a waste of time and resources

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sadly my grandpa passes away so i cant ask him but when he was alive he never sad anything negative about his time as a pow as any young man he had to join the wehrmacht and wasnt a nazi
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the gang goes to community college
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah but hes not the one doing the punch
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and id be genuinely hard pressed to believe that the ss were a voluntary ideological force i doubt there were any moderate members or few if there were
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you saying that only germans can be national socialists it doesnt matter if they werent part of nsdap they joined a criminal organization and held national socialist beliefs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,right the genitive case correct i was under the impression that was more for written text as opposed to being used conversationally one could argue the internet and our text on here really is more representative of conversational speech as opposed to formal written speechbut then id be stretching a bit thanks for the info

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you trying to lecture a german on his mother tongue its accusative dativ plural from themvon den
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,snatch greatest movie ever in film animation views since jun httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sure i make some up from time to time too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats pretty cool the soldiers were allowed to ship these items back home during the war they could literally write their address on the flag itself and ship it home for free shoot me a pic of the knives are they bayonets i can give you info and values on them judging on condition matching numbers etc most likely the knives are worth more than the flag believe it or not
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this all is just my assumption and im not sure if you are asking why is there a large range overall or why do the price ranges for the individual pieces have such varying ranges the first part would simply be rarity if a particular badge was awarded to a large amount of troops there will be many more surviving examples than one that was awarded to a small amount the second part is closely related to the first if there are many surviving examples condition of the item plays less of a roll in the value of the item resulting in a tighter range however if there are a much smaller amount remaining of a particular item a significantly higher quality example will come with a much steeper pricetag ninja edit after rereading op i thik he was just being lazy ex is exactly sorry for overexplaing something simple instead
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not an expert but im speculating it has to do with the condition since most badges would have been involved in combat situations they could very easily have been dented scratched bent etc
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i suspect ea does not mean from to but rather from to even the most insignificant nazirelated bauble is of considerable value to certain people and a bit of story true or otherwise adds a fair bit to the value the difference between badass war trophy and we found a box of these in a warehouse you might say
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hi a lot of these replies are on track condition does have a lot to do with it but i wasnt just being lazy a major factor in value of third reich militaria especially medals is something which a lot of collectors are crazy aboutwhich is maker marks the company name stamped into the medal on back the making of third reich medals and everything else really were contracted out to different companies inside germany they had to follow strict regulations but these makers had their own dies meaning each companies medals were a little different a major factor was the details on some features of the medals were different better looking eagle on the medal more detailed feathersetc fetch higher price some companies badges are more rare to find than others which raise the value another major factor is what metal was used zinc medals are worth a bit less than say buntmetal or tombak as they seem to age faster zinc pestetc also certain metals actually show details better we pay close attention to detail on these medals which in terms raise the prices within the community really
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i meant sorry you cant buy anything third reich related for under now really even certain photos can fetch hundreds now ss items are worth the most and a single ss helmet starts at about to many factors involved in price even most complete regular german helmets fetch or more now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the us troops themselves surely did this this type of thing is often seen in the collecting world ive seen german medals attached to wallets cigarette cases us pistol holsters and gear armbands you name it it was simply done as an easy way of carrying and displaying their war trophies war souvenirs were a huge interest and trading tool amongst the us and allied forces in my guess is that this troop found this flag and started attaching everything he found along his journey to it the germans wouldnt have done this because there is no reason for them to plus there are items from different branches on this flag ss lw army etcso it would be very rare for say a german army troop to have a ss or lw medal let alone a flag
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yup youre righti didnt see the ribbon i figured it was attached by the classes pincatch he even pinned a ostmedaille on there next to it lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is an awesome question german veterans who were awarded medals during were still allowed to keep their medals but not wear them however after the war these men could obtain versions of their very medals made of high quality just without the swastikas here is an example of the version of the many veterans hid anything with a swastika after the war a panzer veteran i talk to actually walked home after being released from an american pow detainment camp after escaping the russians and threw everything he had into a chest buried it in the backyard and didnt touch it for years and years he now has them preserved and inside his house lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i meant lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i must say its pretty intennis
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tis for them i think its like anzac day for us edit maybe you were questioning the relevance of happy on somber occasions like memorial day anzac day yeah i dunno mate but it would be strange to say have a sad day remembering the lost veterans victims of war
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im glad im not the only one who finds that leaning on the macabre side as a brit i dont recall anyone saying happy armed forces day or happy remembrance sunday
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah it is maybe not so much if someone had just lost a son or father to war but in this case its perfectly fine
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,happy memorial day seems weird its about honoring those who died in war happy veterans day seems fine but thats a totally different holiday idk sometimes the meaning of a holiday gets a bit missed but i totally would not say it comparing memorial day to anzac day is pretty apt nzus dual citizen here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in merica people wish each other a happy memorial day with ease i heard multiple happy memorial days today i think mostly because they dont really think about what the day actually signifies and just are happy they get the day off work and they dont have enough excuses to be nice to people so they take advantage when they can and wish people a happy day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,meh as a child of the military its a bit cringe inducing to me but most people in the states just see it as a three day weekend without bothering to understand what the day is about
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pre truckboattruck days
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,from further down sadly it was stolen from him while he was being transported on a train sometime during the war he was not happy of course and believed it was stolen by someone in his platoon even in his old age you could tell he was still mad at the thieving bastard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stolen not confiscated though frankly by that stage in the war having your stuff nicked as a pow was a pretty good deal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,relevant name noted
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its less about naming it after a jewish king and more disguising the project name that would be logical captain but the germans had a fondness for naming stuff after relevant myths eg object of the bruneval raid the goddess freya had a watchman heimdall who could see to the horizon by day night a british radar scientist figured out what freya was from that an antisonar rubber coating for uboats named after a mythological character who could become invisible
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpiimgurcomovweinujpg thought i was in sws at the time so i didnt think the s was necessary
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not if that trophy belongs to someone else think about how you would feel if someone stole your swastika flag

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there were some lucky german pows that got sent to camps in canada by the british they were apparently treated so well that of them wanted to stay in canada after the war ended from the article games and entertainment werent overlooked either inside lethbridges camp there were regular soccer tournaments prisoners enjoyed handball boxing wrestling gymnastics tennis skating and more in november it was reported to the red cross that the internees had a orchestra a band and several smaller musical groups in accordance with geneva convention rules pows were permitted to wear uniforms and insignia in camp and were provided the best winter garb i mean out of context the camps still sucked compared to being free but in context the camps were way better than what they were dealing with during the war

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah that was my thought that a badge was so damaged that it was only worth a couple of dollars and a pristine badge was worth hundreds but turns out it was just shorthand
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks yeah i wasnt sure if it was because of the quality of the medal or if it was shorthand for hundred i was guessing that a medal might have been so badly damaged that it was only worth a few dollars because it was practically unrecognizable like how a coin collector wouldnt pay much for a coin that was run over by a train because while the date on the coin might still be visible its basically only worth the price of the materials its made from
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats a reply thanks a lot it really helped to get a better perspective
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,daaaad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i definitely wouldnt say happy anzac day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,anzacs are fucking badass allies
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we are like a modern less educated sparta lots of cult of soldier as someone stated and multiple holidays to celebrate soldiersveterans day memorial day patriots day independence daythere is always an idea that we need another holiday rather than taking care of our veterans and maybe sitting out a couple of wars i say all this as someone whose high school reunions are a bit sparse due to two wars that still have american troops over a decade later
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thankfully we have less of a cult of the soldier cult of armed service thing going on here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,memorial day at least in these parts is the day you go swimming and fire up the grill i think partially because thats a really american way to spend the weekend and its a sort of tribute to us living the american way because of the sacrifice of the soldiers its more recently at least locally become more about thanking veterans and respecting those that are dead
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,or we understand but we dont let things that we cant change affect us why would you want to spend a day every year acting like youre at a funeral when youre not its an extra day to do something fun for some its a somber day of remembrance for others either way its just another day for me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a trophy that awesome and of such historical significance and value i would be cursing the thief as well years later
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably like to burn flags too dont you garbage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if you want to make an omelette wander around until you come across someone making an omlette kill them and take it ghengis khan
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it was nice but honestly overdone at that point
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sorry about the scare i had to put on a show for the cameras
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,still in my nightmares
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theyll probablyremaster it what is dead may never die but rises harder and stronger
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,here is a german portraitpostcard i own sent home by a german luftwaffe pow being held in ottowa canada at pow camp espanola in note that they still wear their uniformsmedals w swastikas most pow camps stripped the insignias and some denazified the badges each barrack would have a lagerfuhrer usually the highest ranking person to keep a military type discipline within the barracks httpimgurcomagcikn
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pierce is bastard man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hed be one of a few exceptions and even if he was indifferent to hitlers racial ideas almost without exception anyone in the ss was a pretty strong believer in nazi beliefs and id be willing to say that without much exception ss troops active in the war committed atrocities to a man doubly so for any stationed in the east
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not necessarily a lecture its just someone correcting it this is actually why i like reddit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no need german case endings are a nightmare
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,got me there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice basque skills but im not translating that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,atrocious rymes with bictersocious
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,awesome yep i have one as well they are a neat piece of history and i agree they were basically nazi boy scouts haha he was right look forward to seeing them whenever you have the chance no rush im always on here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dude you have to become a vigilante superhero and fight crime dressed all in black swinging a pair of nazi knives
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,idk if i ever said it hope not
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it may have to do with the percentage of people you know who died in action here in israel if i bid someone happy memorial day i might get beaten everybody goes to memorial services people step out of their car to stand for a minute in memory of the fallen when a siren blares sure is different
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah they can be worth a lot unfortunately people out there try and take advantage of the veterans my great grandpa was offered for a nazi flag that hung over a road in germany it reached from one side of the street to the other so its huge and this guy tried to play it off that he was giving my grandpa a deal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i no s here good joke almost fell for it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if its tasty find another omelette maker kill everyone hes ever known and press him into omelette servitude dont let your children have too many omelettes though send them out to wander around the steppe and find their own omelette makers for a while
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pierce is asshole why charlie hate
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im not sure how he was the exception the guy was quite content to allow slave labour to buikd his rockets and that he visited concentration camps to get labour
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hed be one of a few exceptions what about the other brought over with operation paperclip my argument is that if you give von braun a pass then you have to give the other a pass if you do that then its more than a few
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and for that matter supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not sure many people see a swastika and think superhero these days nor wielding knives
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your politicians suck must be the inspiration for your soldiers to be dicks too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you sure do have a purty mouth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i never said i give him a pass or any of his cohorts who spent their time devising new ways to indiscriminately flatten chunks of london
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,very nice items man thanks for sharing hope you hold onto them hj knife is a beauty nice condition maker marked rzm number on it helmet is great too they have climbed in value over recent years too i suggest you or any family members of us veterans to contact the nara for their family members service records you might find some cool info
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so are we also saying that the guys who worked on the manhatten project and deployed allied strategic bombing doctrine should also be lumped in with ss warcriminals and race purgers von brauns rockets terrorized london but they dont even come close to what the allies did to german cities with their bombing campaigns
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did your grandmother tell you the story behind that picture would be interesting to hear one doesnt meet people like hemingway every day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youve all reminded me how beautiful my grandma was she would have laughed her ass off at these comments
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cuban women make wonderful wives i know because ive never had one

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im fucking lit ernest hemingway
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i love how somebody posts a picture of their beloved relative and the top comment chain in this thread is all about how boring and insufferable hemingway probably found said relative reddit impresses me with its ability to shit on anything and everything
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,does she look like justin bieber to anyone else

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,til your grandma blew ernest hemingway
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandma licked some wrinkly old balls
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did you know that the old man and the sea is actually an allegory of lesbian relationships and how they relate to white privilege my womens studies professor mahalia x says that the boat is actually a penis metaphor and the old man represents slavery now consider how the ocean is a proxy for the menstrual cycle kill me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,later your grandma realized she fucked up saying oh go suck start a shotgun ernie

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,do you look anything like hemingway
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably more than a chat there based on hemingways track record
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what are you thinking about suicide

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,look at that old man out there in the sea
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was hot as hell ill fuck her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they would appreciate this over at rgirlsmirin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was a good lover because she was an honest lover and thats what cuban women do to men and theres nothing fine and noble about lying in the sand unless you make love gracefully and then its not only noble but brave because of castro or whatever
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he doesnt look into it or he has hemorrhoids
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and that kids is how i met your mother
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was this before or after he died
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandma looking fineeeeeeee
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i bet they had more than that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he looks like graham norton
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,til ernest hemingway is your grandfather
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ur old
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,op you may be hemingways grandson
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he tore it up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,will someone please shoot me in the face is the expression i see

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,vavaboom

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,very cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did they just discover a cache or time traveled warhead candies cause they both have lemon face
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think your grandma had more than a chat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hope she did him because i certainly would have
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes either just about to go down on him or just coming up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,chat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,do you ever wonder if he hit that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandma was hot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i thought it was william shatner with a beard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and all they did was chat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandma kinda looks like justin bieber
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandma looks like an old man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,william shatner should play ernest hemingway in a movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think i like vanilla pudding
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im an english teacher and i am so used to seeing him in photos it is odd to see the icon just living like a normal guy he is such a myth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he is thinking god damn
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he looks a bit like graham norton
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i have but touchÃ©
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he looks a lot like that photostock dude
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was a lady killer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gray hemingway
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she did not have very many interesting things to say but her face was pretty and her boobs had not yet experienced the gravity that you see in the boobs of the older more interesting women and i thought that she might be a beautiful lay so i withstood an afternoon of dull conversation in order to take her back to the pilars master quarters and feel the sea move
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,itt a bunch of people saying an average woman in an old photo was super hot and ignoring the entire point of the photo in the first place
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey cuban here any idea of what they were talking about english or spanish
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats definitely papa hs speaking with women is just as painful as i write about face
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,great photo of your grandparents
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think its pretty wellestablished that were all into ops grandmother or at least wish we could be
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe if i shot myself she would shut up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,honey now get on back to your cradle hubby has drinking to do dont worry after i get all liquored up ill be coming to tuck you in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your mema got dicked down by earnest hemingway most likely
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,diary entry for that day title the cock also rises
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh i think more than a chat was going on there the body language is actually extremely telling their arms are tightly pressed up against one another that is the body language of people who are extremely comfortable around one another in fact if i extrapolate his left arms position i bet the probability is higher that its placed on her leg more so than it is his own he was a known womanizer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tbh he doesnt look very interested
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes probably like hey you should kill yourself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,chat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what a cool picture leave it up to reddit to destroy what could have been a very interesting conversation
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like your grandma made hemingway want to kill himself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that guy fucked
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so he could be your grandpa
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hemingway bloodline checking in dads great uncle in that shot why i have to tell people my name only has m annoys me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i really hope she at least blew him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kiera knightly could play your grandma in a movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandmother looked a bit like justin biebers next look
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah yes my favourite person in my favourite place
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont how to tell you this op but your grandmother might be have been a communist spy if she was hanging with hemingway known kgb agent
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,please call me papa a little ketchup for your buns papa
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,httpwwwpogdesigncoukcatimgsmidmainthegrahamnortonshowjpg
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,your grandma looks like justin bieber faceswapped her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it looks like he was chatting her up the old fox still had it in him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,grandma would get it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,guess the old man wasat the seaif you know what i mean
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so thats why he killed himself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she was going for it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think they did more than chat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how many months did he do her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,get fucking burned grandma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i drink so i can talk to assholes this includes myself james douglas morrison
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whelp this humblebrag didnt go as expected
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,intellectually savage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rekt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the killer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,me a russian spy i would never do anything like that comrade hemingway
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i take whatever mundane shit i was doing anyway and i just start pouring booze on it and within a short period of time its fantastic doug stanhope
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,truer words have never been spoken or written
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont have a problem i have a solution doug stanhope
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no she was always very vague about it just telling me how interesting he was and how much fun they had she was filming a documentary on cuba at the time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not these days
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,one doesnt meet people like hemingway every day actually yes you do dont get me wrong he was an interesting guy but there are millions of interesting people this one just happened to get famous
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just from this one picture i have to say she had the spark im guessing the world is less impressive without her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,unfortunately she drank his would be brother
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah he definitely porked her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,female bipeds make wonderful wives too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no no no for whom the bell tolls by metallica
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nah guns n roses patience
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he doesnt seem listening completely in this photo perhaps thats the moment he realized how naive those words actually were
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,let people talk about themselves listen to them honestly and intently with genuine interest ask followup questions based on what they said that allow them to continue talking about themselves this is one of the most typical methods to being wellliked and causing people to have positive feelings about your conversations
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,farewell to grams
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the grandson also rises
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for whom the belle tolls
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for whom trolls your grandma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the old man and the c
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,time marches on

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,goo at first light
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the old grams and the sea
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the hos of kilimanjaro
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,top rated string of comments all about how boring hemingway must have found this woman second top rated string all about how he absolutely must have fucked her and a smirking comment about how pearshaped ops humblebrag turned out this place disgusts me it really does

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh god its my senior lit seminar all over again
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,grandma but yeah i guess she looks pretty hot objectively speaking of course
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if you enjoyed the paris wife youd likely also enjoy z a novel of zelda fitzgerald by therese anne fowler it tells another story of the same period and the same circle i think zelda gets a bad rep which is fairly undeserved and this book does a great job of demonstrating her side
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i read his wiki page about a week a go and immediately ordered of his books from amazon dude had an amazing life been enjoying the sun also rises very much so far
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,came out of a long long time hiding in the shadows to say that if you enjoy hemingway you should check out one of his pals william seabrook i think youll like him he was a fascinating man and his book asylum is quite the read
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what town and insane how
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he didnt write drunk he actually was incredibly disciplined he wrote every morning then in the evenings he would get his drink on he used to give faulkner all kinds of shit for writing drunk he said he could tell just by reading at what point in the page faulkner took his first drink
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you need your dementia meds old man

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,get fucking burned grandma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont think you have the slightest clue what a humblebrag is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i thought multiple involuntary electroshock therapy sessions and access to a shotgun was the killer though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i have to admit the your female relative had sex with celeb comments that always come with these photos usually make me roll my eyes your followup comment however is making me think its likely true in this case not that theres anything wrong with that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my inlaws knew the castros precoup father in laws dad was drinking buddies with hemingway i used to brag about this until i realized that everyone at the bar was drinking buddies with hemingway i wonder if your grandmother ever crossed paths with my wifes family
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how interesting he was how much fun they had
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no she was always very vague about it he plowed her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to me this photo looks like it was taken after hemingway said a bad pun the expression of your grandma is of mild disgust
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she didnt give details because she spent most of the time with her legs spread getting pounded
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,studies suggest that even if a girl doesnt get pregnant sleeping with a man causes fragments of his dna to remain in her system while im not aware of any proof that says these traits are passed down it would seem likely or at least slightly possible to have some effect why else save them what im saying is you might have a little hemingway in you because that story sounds like shes had a little hemingway in her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youtube link
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who knew duck face was a thing back then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what documentary
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what documentary was she filming
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no disrespect but any chance hes your biological grandfather
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes your grandpa
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im sorry about all those comments op apparently a woman cannot talk to a famous man and be photographed while doing so because according to most comments they were either having sex or he was drinking to get through the conversation dynamics of this sub bore me to death sometimes do you all come from the do women even vote in your country did you know that it is possible for a woman to talk about things other than small talk it might even be possible to do so without having sex before or after and if there was any sex it might even be possible that she was smart enough not to get pregnant even more she probably went on with her life after all this just like other heretic women do studying and doing other ungodly things
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,uncle

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hear the movie which hemingway based the book on is based on that song
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,perhaps this is the moment you realize that you read his face wrong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,perhaps thats the moment he decided life was futile and made plans to shoot himself in the face with a shotgun
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats why i put this one up d hoped someone would catch on
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah and its a great way of tricking women into having sex with you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,get rid of the seaward

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the blows of kilimanjaro
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rsummerreddit rreddit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,to be fair turn on a tv in a room full of women and watch them gush over prince william ryan reynolds george clooney etc men do the exact same over famous women hell even jezebel seems to think its perfectly ok to sexually objectify famous men acting like celebrity is not attractive for both sexes is kind of naive even if it is politically correct
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,exactly my thoughts its either that or all those mentality comments making fun about how she was annoying him with her conversation i get slammed in this sub every time i bring this up but i dont care
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont know about every other time but this time its hemingway were all proud of ops grandma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i agree man i said something similar one time it was some trivial shit that people couldve been civil about if only they had tried and received some nasty messages saying stuff like if you dont like reddit why dont you just leave this place can be mighty frustrating and disappointing at times
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you get better by the day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,woah colorbot is back

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mr tee shame on you one never notices if a family member is hot even ancestors youve never met not even a cave woman
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,right back atcha
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i definitely enjoyed it for the backyard literary gossip as hemingway would call it then especially of their circle i should get that book i wasnt really familiar with zelda until midnight in paris such an intriguing woman other than the gossip that she was the cause of f scotts downfall id love to read her insulting and cursing hemingway hahaha thanks ill look into it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i just finished islands in the stream last night i would definitely recommend it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,anything by their circle is definitely my kind of juice other than the usuals fsg macleish stein pound joyce id love to read that thank you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,small midwestern town just did weird stuff at times amazing teacher and seemed like her heart was always in the right place but she had her days for sure
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lol such a hemingway thing to do dish out advice that you dont yourself follow ð
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a wee bit of one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,some people absoutlely hate communist with an undying passion especially those who came from former communist countries
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he has jaundice in this rendition but other than that not bad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god is she going to stop talking
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wonder how far it is to to ambercrombie fitch
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,god she really is serious about this just wanting to talk bartender
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his facial expression is like harolds from the stock photos
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i see it more optimistically like hes thinking i may have shat myself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont pay for the sexi pay for them to leave some guy somewhere possibly hemingway
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he begins to contemplate suicide
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cuz grandma can git it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just trying to plow her
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he got that thousand yard stare
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what she just said member that book you wrote about the fisherman and the shark you should write part two tell his story after the shark he fights pirates
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,enlighten us
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,too soon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,paid off in silver dollars hot to trot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the old man and the seaduction
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think the guy whose mom dated the fonz is probably another scenario where the mom was fucked
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah but congrats you might be related to a famous writer good luck with government surveillance induced hysteria
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,php huh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its such a weird insult or thing to get weird about my mom and grandmother had lots of sex because they are of good stock most sex shamers are just jealous edit lol out come the jealous ones
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they say he was impotent so perhaps not
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,plus its hemingway she probably did fuck him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hemingway was gay
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hemingway got married in the picture was from according to the title
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if you have read anything at all about hemmingway you know this likely the case
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the look on her face screams that shes fond of him
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there it is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,make no mistake op knows what he is doing op knows exactly what he is doing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,citation needed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why not both
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you mean your grandma didnt give birth to your brother
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what the fuck is this why am i laughing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,risky click of the day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the plot thickens
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she gave birth to ernest hemingways son just to drink his jizzm seriously though isnt it rude to talk about ops gran gran like this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the aristocrats
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,eh it was gross but not that bad that subs for stuff much more offensive and edgy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he fucks hens use the correct gender pronoun shitlord
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i prefer kangaroos personally though theyre almost tripeds
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,please tell me this was a diogenes joke
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,while humans are just featherless bipeds so were just plucked chickens
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in your face diogenes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fuck off diogenes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ufuckswithchickens
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he married a chicken ive been told that getting married is a quick road to celibacy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,with broad flat nails
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,speak for yourself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,be the hero we all need
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ill leave when im good and ready
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its not about that though this is a picture of a woman talking and a man listening from that everyone has extrapolated that her chatter must have been inane enough to drive him to drink and she definitely gladly fucked and blew him all about somebodys fucking grandmother jesus christ
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the ironic kicker in all of this is that for someone with such a big rep for machismo and some questionable portrayals of women in his stories hemingway actually knew how to be friends with women and genuinely enjoyed aspects of them that occurred above the waist he had a lifelong platonic friendship with marlene dietrich who was at the height of her sexsymbol status when they first met and whom he affectionately called the kraut he took up for her strenuously when many suspected her of being a nazi spy or sympathizer because of her german heritage during wwii as troubled as he was and as much of an emotional cripple as he could be hemingway seems to have known how to do something that a lot of these people apparently dont think is possible ie enjoy the company of women for drinking and conversation not just as potential places to put his dick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it made her shoulders disappear they were hard to distinguish in bw but they are the same color as the foliage behind her now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,are you sure yeah its better than nothing but i wouldnt say its good as such
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the greatest old man a lot of people are saying and the tremendous sea
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gramma had a stamma
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe his arms are broken
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not sure about a creep but its well known he was a alcoholic
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre quite welcome
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the family has a history of mental illness
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not to disparage but just did weird stuff at times and she had her days is the worst answer in the world to the question insane how specifics dude what kind of weird stuff
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i added alcohol and things turned for the worse wtf that never happened before
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,really shes just sorta mashing it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont even know what a humblebrag is and my iq is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,too soon or not soon enough
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the old man and the seamen in yer nan
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the dick also rises a farewell to my panties a moveable fuck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yo link
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you might be related to a famous writer given the writer you may want to start taking antipsychotics soon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jedgars long gone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,actually the only thing i have any recent experience with is perl however i admit that i wasnt explicitly thinking of perl when i wrote that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh for sure the only time id be judgemental about anyones sexual choices is if they are violating the trust they have with some person they are in a relationship with no relationshipopen relationship who am i to care cheating on your spouse or so well now you are a scumbag but lots of people dont really like to think of their grandmother pulling a train that one wild night in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,because they are of good stock so what is your excuse
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,all our ancestors had sex thats why we are here i hope most of mine had good and frequent sex
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my grandmother and mother had lots of sex i read that incorrectly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whos getting weird youre the only one that mentioned it its just a joke its is rather funny when the op is completely oblivious to that possibility im guessing most ops know the score though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rgrandmasmirin
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that op doesnt know what hes doing he knows exactly what hes doing

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so when you say girls you mean female flies and when you say not pregnant you mean pregnant thank you for providing the citation but i think youre reading too much into it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no one needs a plot to have porn
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,savage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes not his lady friend shes his special lady man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i agree the bot is probably correct i am not a bot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,unless we get an upscaler that really really adds smooth and definition seems hard
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rchimichangas
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,put your back to the wind im gonna roast this bone
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its the implication that if she doesnt sleep with me ill blow my head off with a shotgun

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think you read too much into the joke setup besides i said studies suggest
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,exactly what a bot in disguise would say we found it guys our work is done here
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes id imagine youd use machine learning to interpret what to put there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i knowthat gag never fails to crack me up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we did a bunch of those monster energy drinks and dry humped

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,clearly youve never read it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as an average ameican the only people i dont know personally that i learn about are from tabloid headlines i read while waiting in the checkout line at the market to buy my crisps and soda
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i have but touchÃ©
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,still cant tell if youre joking
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,excellent hopefully he didnt stick around the gpo for long as i think it took a serious shelling great photo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you must be very proud of your grandfather knowing that he was playing a part in irish history has to make your family proud they were brave men and women who fought in the gpo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he was there until the end when the fire forced them out then arrested and spent the rest of the year in kilmainham gaol where this photo is now displayed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we are although i never knew him obviously ive been listening to these stories all my life from my dad and his brothers and sisters its only recently that i have started doing my own research
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,must be cool to have a grandfather who played such a large role in freeing ireland from english rule again great picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,crikey
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,with owen guns no less
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wasnt there also a austen model an improved version of the sten here in canada the sten was regarded by our guys as a piece of crap and as soon as they could find a thompson or a us it was in the ditch soldiers all ways find the stuff that works regardless of the stuff that they may have been issued the junk gets dropped jim b
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the austen was a definite improvement over the sten it even copied bits from the german guns but reliability never got close to the almost legendary level of the owen it was one of the ugliest guns ever but particularly in the jungles where contact happened at much closer ranges its obvious why the diggers held that reliability in huge regard i think a few were even used in vietnam
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice she may be years younger but she already has the watchful cynical eyes of someones mom
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dancers always seem to have this lovely attractive weariness about them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks a bit like a friend of minebit of an uncanny resemblance very lovely though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cause of the black swan
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i see a serious lack of crawling through deploymentold garbage being quizzed while being sprayed with a fire hose and eating a cherry out of the belly button of the fattest shellback submariners those days had it easy compared to when i was in i earned my shellback in edit typo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,damn wogs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive got plenty of oldschoolgross but thats a different sub
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i grew up in vallejo back when mare island was still there in the and there was this submariner dive called the horse and cow and what the submariners did to each other in there was legendary
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,horse and cow is always a dive i think theyre built already dingy and fit for drunken sailors
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the name shrimpton is very unfortunate

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,such a badass this guy is old school cool and his name is awesome
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this dude fights fascists
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i live off of audie murphy hwy and we have a once a year weekend festival in his name in n texas he was a badass and of course he was from texas
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he had to tone the story down when he wrote his autobiography he was afraid people wouldnt believe it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not one of the highest he was the most decorated person in us military history he also as you can imagine had a lot of issues after that from alcoholism to womanizing to deep depression and ptsd while his heroism and valor are the kind of characteristics the army wants its soldiers to have unfortunately due to his actions later in life he isnt really held in as great as an esteem as you would imagine however there is an award for excellence named after him source us army vet
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,supposedly he had horrible ptsd when i hear about him i always feel sadhis notoriety as a solider well overshadows his debilitating condition
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theres a prestigious army award named after this badass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and that is a congressional medal of honor hanging around his neck he was a true hero and badass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if thered be any glory in war let it rest on men like him who went to hell and came back
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,let them fall face down if they must die making it easier to say good bye
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,infantry regiment can do
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,for an hour murphy stood on the flaming tank destroyer returning german fire from foot soldiers and advancing tanks killing or wounding germans he sustained a leg wound during his stand and stopped only after he ran out of ammunition medal of honor action oh and he was about
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,anyone else see similarities here with frederick zoller
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,literally a badass he got shot in the hip by a german sniper with the bullet exiting his butt because of the time it took to get him to a hospital gangrene set in and they had to cut out part of his ass this injury was the second of three purple hearts oh and he killed the sniper
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,haha he honestly looks so unassuming but then you learn what he did and its like wowza
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,texas come for austin stay forwell there are some roadside freak shows to check out i guess
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,some ago i had the privileged of meeting his widow at a va hospital what mr murphy was sadly unable to do later on in life due to as you described she carried torch and carried it well a very formidable yet kind and gracious woman if ever was one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,austin used to be cool sucks now
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im glad to hear that she married an american hero and she should be proud of that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks like rosamund pike
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,remember in the where you could have a music video that consisted entirely of the artist dancing around in a occasionally riding a and a

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if the dude pretty much won the war for us then by god he should have been allowed all the gay sex he wanted i hope all those that persecuted feel deep shame
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,crossposted from rcolorizedhistory httpwwwturingorgukpublicationsdnbhtml his life is an interesting but sad one definitely worth reading up on alan turing was arrested and came to trial on march after the police learned of his sexual relationship with a young manchester man he made no serious denial or defence instead telling everyone that he saw no wrong with his actions he was particularly concerned to be open about his sexuality even in the hard and unsympathetic atmosphere of manchester engineering rather than go to prison he accepted for the period of a year injections of oestrogen intended to neutralise his libido his work on the morphogenetic theory continued he developed his theory of pattern formation out of instability into the realm of spherical objects such as the radiolaria and also on the cylinder as a model of plant stems he set as a particular goal the explanation for the appearance of the fibonacci numbers in the leaf patterns of plants â most noticeable in the closepacked spirals of sunflower heads and fir cones besides this he refreshed his youthful interest in quantum physics studying the problem of wavefunction reduction in quantum mechanics with a hint that he was considering a nonlinear mechanism for it he took a new interest in the representation of elementary particles by spinors and in relativity theory a factor in his life unknown to most around him was that he had also continued to work for gchq the postwar successor to bletchley park on the basis of a personal connection with alexander now its director but since the conditions of the cold war and the alliance with the united states meant that known homosexuals had become ineligible for security clearance turing now therefore excluded spoke bitterly of this to his onetime wartime colleague now engineer donald bayley but to no other personal friends state security also seems the likely cause of what he described as another intense crisis in march involving police searching for a visiting norwegian who had come to see him concern over the foreign contacts of one acquainted with state secrets was understandable and his holiday in greece in could not have been calculated to calm the nerves of security officers although unable to tell his friends about questions of official secrecy in other ways he actively sought much greater intimacy of expression with them and with a jungian therapist eccentric solitary gloomy vivacious resigned angry eager dissatisfied â these had always been his evervarying characteristics and despite the strength that he showed the world in coping with outrageous fortune noone could safely have predicted his future course he was found by his cleaner when she came in on june he had died the day before of cyanide poisoning a halfeaten apple beside his bed his mother believed he had accidentally ingested cyanide from his fingers after an amateur chemistry experiment but it is more credible that he had successfully contrived his death to allow her alone to believe this the coroners verdict was suicide
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont think he was ever happy except when he saved many peoples lives his own life was too sad
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes his story is both sad and maddening i enjoyed that film the imitation game yes im sure it took some liberties or combined people and events but it was certainly a tearjerker at the end cumberbatch did a good job capturing the complexity of turing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the way i understand it alan turing did more toward ending the war and winning it for his side than any other man what a hero
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this guy was a champ look at that smug looking mug who could hate this little fella
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he looks like bill hader would have lived to see hader give the role a try
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he looks like dr what from that show was he gay like aaron rodgers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not to mention he more or less invented the computer he was basically the father of all computing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the government didnt see it that way
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh alan such a shame
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes his story is both sad and maddening this is the best summary i have ever read about him such a tragedy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im in the middle of it right now its on netflix definitely a must watch
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seems he also invented the synthesiser
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i guess those are cool shortslol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i bet that car was hot as hell in az lots of untinted glass and a crappy ac if it had one my mom had a pinto and we lived in cen cal
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pintos ugly death traps
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,perfect for keeping cool in the arizona summer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did everyone have the same couch and paneling back then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats a scary outfit for sure
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i love the wooden panel walls its like living in a ski lodge
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did your mama say to get things done you better not mess with major tom i know that songs from but the outfit reminded me of it

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i know hes probably just blinking but ringo looks high as a kite
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why does paul have a baseball glove and pool cue
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just hold this drumstick
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its from help so there is a pretty strong chance that theyre all at least a little buzzed while filming the scene especially paul for context paul and john are quietly discussing if ringo really needs to keep his ring finger because he hardly ever uses it a cult is after them and intend to sacrifice ringo because hes wearing the sacred ring so john and paul wonder how bad it would be to just cut his finger off and give them the ring back
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes asking ringo if he could live without his fingerhand dont remember havent seen it in a while
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he has a lefty glove on his right hand
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats my grandma too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats not a soldier not only is it clear in the the other person is also wearing a sweater but it was published the week of august over a fortnight before the german invasion of poland before even the unholy pact between nazi germany and the ussr no one was leaving for any wars
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy shit thats my train

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im sorry to hear that but he must have lived quite a life my great grandfather was a medic for the soviets he passed away in im proud of his medals
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i went to school with a friend who came from russia he said that near his old high schoolis it called high school in russia there was a pretty big forest he said each tree was planted for soviet solduers who lost their life in i couldnt remember if it was just for a specific battle or not but i would think so because ussr lost a lot of men during the war anyways i think about what he told me from time to time and it always manages to bring a tear to my eye because i know so many of those men were in fact very young heartbreaking
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yea they fought hard and lost a lot of men hitler must have shat the bed when he heard them coming lol
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he better have what a prick

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dont you mean seymoure

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,too bad her jewelry line is shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those genetics are really strong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im struggling to tell who is the mom and who is the daughter both are on top notch in the looks dept
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks like she rides horses
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,british people have bad teeth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,also everyones hair has a terminal length mine is about halfway down my back and not that thick my stepsister could grow it to her ankles if she wanted having really long hair that still looks good is simply physically impossible for a lot of people all women try the long hair look there is a reason most of us dont keep it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mine was that long not too hard to maintain really but it just go so damned boring took about years to get it there and there werent many cute styles you can do with that much weight in a reasonable amount of time im actually growing it back out to see how long i can get it before i get frustrated with it last cut was donated to wigs for kids figured id try and give them another
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i am a woman with super long hair and it is difficult to maintain i havent had a haircut in years despite the annoyance of having long hair i still love it and i love all the compliments i get on my hair i was walking in front of these two older ladies and they stroked my hair while expressing how long it was lol i didnt even notice until my sister told me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its really common in colombia to have it that long
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,her and were always my favorite
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i like tanya roberts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it worked
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,spider bite its so itchy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she played solitaire in live and let die
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i always thought it was funny that a woman who has been married four times would design heart jewelry that looked two snakes fighting to the death
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,also being natural was the thing so you didnt have hair gone bad fake tans bad makeup cosmetic procedures overall people were slimmer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,because most american women are overweight or obese now more american women look like mama cass than jane seymour nowadays
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thank you i knew i couldnt be the only one seeing this
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,because she picked it as her stage name
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im not saying she doesnt look good but theres a decent bit of photoshop involved in that picture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if i compare that to recent family pictures i dont have good genetics come on gataca already i want to update
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fuuuuck does she want kids at cuz thats how you get pregnant at
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its always time for a marathon over in rjamesbond
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whats wrong with you lmfao every time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whats wrong with prostitutes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why she isnt in that movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i guess the reason for that is because she wasnt in ferris bueller
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ha i cant tell which one of her eyes is looking at the camera theres also some joke about her other eye looking at some overly coked out boyfriend but id never say that shit
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,seymour was solitaire domino was in thunderball

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,shes really really tiny really short she spoke at a local diabetes run someone in her family has diabetes and shes become an advocate for the cause making appearances at diabetes events all over the country so short and an activist for a good cause
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you guys remember that reality show that would air late at night where they followed the pornographer who went by the name seymour butts when i was a kid i used to watch that show saturday nights hoping to catch a stray boob if latin lover or real sex werent on
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,janes father is polish and her mother is dutch not a bad mixture
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the mom is the hot one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow i had no idea i am learning a lot about womens hair today thanks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,beards have a terminal length too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if she hasnt grown it that long before and if hair has a terminal length how do you know your stepsister could grow her hair to her ankles
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,interesting i hadnt considered that thanks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,her role is kinda icky now since basically tricks her into sex with a fake tarot deck
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well now i feel dumb
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah they might as well have just photoshopped her head onto someone elses body which looking back at it that might be what they did after all kind of silly since shes a beautiful woman
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,christie brinkley is also
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im still having a very awkward time closing these tabs
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,domino was in thunderball oops all the bond girls names blend together after a while
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it is awesome until zoom shows up
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,heres another famous person buried in the central city cripple creek mt pisgah cemetery
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,amazing that old fart used to look so hot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,now i have that song in my head a drunkards dream if there ever was one
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was there last summer i didnt go to the gold mine but i did see the donkeys
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you need to up your troll game king that was weak as hell
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre right i dont actually give a shit about lookin fine dr quinn medicine woman youre paying attention to the important details pathetic one good for you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,were good to a lot of women
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looked good in wedding crashers kitty cat
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my wife doesnt realize how hot she is she just sees an older woman peddling necklaces i see a woman who is hot as hell compared to girls half her age
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think shes even hotter now because she doesnt just have that look what face and body i was born with thing going by now shes hotter because she earned it you dont stay hot at without working at it at least a little and shes still got that confident smirk going on constantly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its true she has held up well through the years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wedding crashers oh yea she definitely still has it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is the song we sing to my best friends kid every year on his birthday wish he was being such a typical shithead teenager right now i love that kid
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that scene where vince vaghn was about to be raped by the gay son only for christopher walken to walk in while hes still tied up and has a erotic portrait of himself always has been in stiches
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where is she by the way she still in the house
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,were they built for speed or comfort
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,her and lynda carter are the goats of aging well
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she is still extremely attractive
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow so she definitely stopped at some point prior to
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what are the paparazzi looking at
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the hero we need
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wow i watched way too much of that
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whoosh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,more as in seymour
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,breeze
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,under the bleachers by seymour butts was a reference in the movie the game with michael douglass
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kielbasa covered in chocolate sprinkles be right back
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,actually it is everyones hair men just generally never get far enough to discover what their terminal length is jane seymour has a fantastic terminal length her long hair has been her signature for much of her career theres a reason she can pull that off and most actresses cant she is genetically blessed to be able to grow her hair that long and have it look that good there have been thousands and thousands of articles and tips in womens magazines over the years about how keeping hair healthy means you can grow it to your knees it is all bunk a single strand of hair genetically programmed to grow to a certain length before shedding
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i guess i do not technically know but she has gotten close to a buzz cut before and then let it grow to her knees in two years and it has shown no signs of stopping and it is to her knees and is thick and healthy and glorious
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she did have great cleavage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i always wondered bond actually had the foresight to buy like decks of tarot cards just to pick out all the lovers so he could trick her into losing her virginity thats some seriously psychotic behavior
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,does she want kids at because thats how you get pregnant at
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she has a more plastic look in my opinion jane more natural
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,all good didnt mean to sound like a smart arse but the old bond films are my goto im bored and dont know what to watch films so ive seen them all a million times
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you cant lock up the darkness
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if i ever did see one like most others from the band awesome tune
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if i ever did see one sorry im just a huge fan
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ok
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kind of a weird thing to say
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i like how he just casually checks the strength of the rope and then carries on talking like its normal hah
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,lets play tummy sticks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it looks like mia sara an actor in ferris buellers day off
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no sure which is more crooked her eyes or her nipples
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this link gave my phone aids
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah that site is fucking crap
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did you motorboat them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,plastic surgery professional make uphair artists in any picture you see of her her everyday job is literally to stay in as good of shape possible fountain of youth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a different one than madonna for sure
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,live and let die was
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,mary louise parker has to be on this list even though shes only
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im also going to throw in there she is currently
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably tan mom
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the prince that was promised
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ultra woosh cos that was like a triple entendre see more photos of her see more of her like literally see more seymour
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i figured the same would be true for men too now im curious about what my terminal length is i think i can give seymour a run for her money
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,does that mean its possible someone could lose all their hair at once without losing it good for good by every strand hitting terminal length at the same time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think it might be slightly more complicated to get pregnant at
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah thats true but christie doesnt look anywhere near jane definitely has that aging gracefully kinda look
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if you remember you know no hd no selfies just really good photography
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,jews dont count
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,vince vaughn is my favorite comedic actor ð
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whats tummy stici dont want to play tummy sticks
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and legend
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i remember her from that movie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,neither is a deal breaker so no worries
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no you dont look that good at that age with plastic surgery she bathes in the blood of virgins
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh stahhhhp she doesnt look surgically preserved to me i do think the other stuff plays a big part though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,people always say plastic surgery but even plastic surgery cant make most people that age look good plus in that picture shes not wearing much make up and her hair is a bit messy but she still looks great i do agree with staying in shape though probably the largest factor
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,how is the second different from the first
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,under the bleachers by seymour butts from the game
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i mean the second one is pushing it its still see more
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,look to your sisters if they can grow long thick hair then so can you unless and until you age and lose hair as men often do
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no because at any given time all the hairs in your head are a different length it does not look that way when they are all bunched together but they are so if you shed a hair today then one is already growing back in in its place so no hairs are at terminal length at the same time which is why someone like jane seymour will always have a head of thick long hair however her hair will always be a bit thinner at the ends than at the crown because of the terminal length issue
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no your hair doesnt know when its cut or not its just going to grow long whether you cut it or not and after growing a certain amount its terminal length or shorter if you cut it shed then start again
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,luciana falucci she was in a couple other things here and there mostly dubbed italian stuff
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yea its called menopause and when women stop producing eggs at that point
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you cant lock up the darkness
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pretty sure her surgeon is the one that blood is sacrificed to
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,botox and top of the line facial treatments maybe surgery but small things and natural beauty
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,depends on your skin tone if youre black its generally not going to do anything unless youre outside all day
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,trust me youre better off not knowing
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,more photos numerically see more of her body
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,rflash is leaking everywhere
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ohh okay like with more skin thanks

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hope someone kicked his ass for the pipe

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hope he kicked someones ass to get the pipe
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i feel so lazy i mean your grandpa actually did farming and shit and here i am on reddit for an entire day

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he just had the most cheeky yet kind and sparkling eyes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its mrs doubtfire
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she has a debra messing thing going on he had the same eyes his whole life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,gosh he looks like this kid i knew in second grade named frank
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,those are very protective hands or he was very fidgety
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,so thats where he got his unfunnyness from
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it looks like he has his mothers eyes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,id rather see him go out on his own terms than slide in to dementia becoming less quickwitted and funny and more awkward and stumbling with passing weeks and years
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its been years already
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wtf is wrong with you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wouldnt but i can understand why he did it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,difficult to disagree with that suicide is such a sad plight on humanity though it seems the wonderful human beings like him go while pos like certain leaders extremists and the such continue on
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy fuck youre right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my eyelid started twitching
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sorry been spending too much time on roastme robin williams was an american treasure
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep lost my dad to suicide a few years ago he was looking at spending the rest of his life in a wheel chair do i resent him for it yeah i think he was an idiot and a coward for it but that doesnt mean i dont understand why he did what he did
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,holy shit time flies it feels like it was just a few months ago
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sorry to hear that its tough to really know what someone is going through thinking feeling my dad essentially killed himself years drank himself to death until he was in a coma im only in my early and feel too young to be an orphan i guess i look at it that as long as theres life there is hope one day science tech may bring back mobility for some people anything is possible ð
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,alcohol is evil im pretty sure my dad wouldnt have been able to pull that trigger of his bac wasnt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,agreed it did in my father mother both grandparents two uncles its a powerful drug if you dont mind me saying i checked out a few of your other topic posts and im impressed with your insight and intellect sounds like youve had some rough times but you seem levelheaded and strong
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i appreciate that thank you very much life can be tough at times but overall its good im still in my so i have plenty of room to grow i have to say in some ways even though i wish he was still around and i lost him far too young my dad did me a favor he showed me the end result of a man too proud to admit his own limits or see the doctor as well as what happens when a man sets aside his personal needs for the sake of others and of course taught me just how dark of a place an unchecked addictive personality can get you i hope life is going well for you there arent enough pleasant and personable folks around these days especially on reddit

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes they were but the history of the rangers is kinda all over the place and my understanding as nothing more than a guy interested in hiatory is that the modern rangers are the direct descendants of the lrrp groups in vietnam

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he nailed it wow
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nice info one would think that would be the first test an experiment would consist of just for measuring
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this guy had children and i could barely stand
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,there is the theory that the shroud of turin was actually the first chemically produced photograph by leonardo davinci a photograph of himself
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep definitely the first fuck boii had children too
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,nah in like ce or so
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,actually according to photo historian robert cornelius in may in fact have been a selfie
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whats that from
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes i imagine almost every pioneer with one of the first photographic processes capable of taking an exposure in a reasonable amount of time a few seconds in direct sunlight would have thought to photograph themselves wouldnt you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yep here is one of my favorites in india in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,photographic selfportraits yes self portraits have been around way way longer than that and have historical significance
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,they said it was the oldest selfie theyve ever seen not the oldest one that has ever happened

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you dont just get hair like that by adding overpriced mall store hair gel before commercial shampoo and showers and indoor plumbing you had lye soap and perhaps a well bucket or nearby stream to bathe i imagine daily hair washing was much less of a thing then which can actually be much healthier for your scalp and hair if done correctly
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you see lots of guys in victorian style top coats scoop waistcoats starched shirts and ascots
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cant believe shit we see nowadays

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i feel you im in university with mostly and whenever they ask my age i cringe its the same reaction at my workplace ive had ladies tell me i dont look old enough to be working flattering sure but no one takes a yearold girl seriously
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as i personally hate that compliments it have deeper meaning of you supposedly should look older in your age
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i dont mind the compliment im not the best looking person so i appreciate it and i try to stay looking young while i can i know there will be a point where i wont be able to get that compliment anymore so it does mean a lot to me since i dont really have much else going on lol

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,said the stableboy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well that was around the time of the real estate crash
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,back when memes were in their infancy now get me some waffles fries fo free
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i wish more understood this reference
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,these peanuts are making me thirsty
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that he purchased with a fake id
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,also when halo call of duty modern warfare portal bioshock assassins creed oblivion the original rock band and world of warcraft burning crusade were released hell of a year for gaming thats for sure then there were the protomemes rage comics as it were
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,now the word meme is a meme in its own right were getting dangerously close to a meme singularity
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,me too please explain
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as you wish
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the simpsons
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no more poems i mean it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why does it say years later
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his name was brian mcgee
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,memes have existed for far longer than that rage comics were memes but viral videos can be considered memes as well numa numa hell even dancing baby was a meme
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,portal came out in youre thinking of the original portal which means you should add to that list
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh man modern warfare i never wanted to make love to a game more in my life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,we honestly need to reboot memes this iteration has run its course
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who knew everybody who watched narcos
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,who knew anyone that read killing pablo d
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,pointyshootythingy training
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,none of them are even attempting to aim down the sights what
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in most cases handguns are used in pretty close quarter situations in these situations aiming down the sights is completely unnecessary its much more practical and efficient just to draw point and shoot as quickly as you can lpt if you want to practice efficiency and practicality in terms of self defense with a firearm go to the range and practice pointing and shooting at a relatively close target chances are if you ever are in a situation where you have to use your gun it will most likely be close quarters and therefore impractical to aim down the sights i recommend practicing point and shoot method and aiming down the sights
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,once they grow out their mustaches they will be ready to be chicago cops
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ron swanson
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hey dere girls we gonna be shootin and actin tough okay dere
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the lady cop on the end is oddly sexyfor a lady cop
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i also dont think this isnt an ideal pose for shooting like arent you supposed to be standing kinda sideways to reduce the area of your body available to being shot at from some american movies and videogames gta i know american cops take this pose when they shoot but i have always wondered what the reason behind this is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,currently most officers use an isosceles or weaver stance isoceles is preferred by many departments because while you are directly facing a threat so is the strongest part of your body armor if you stand bladed to a threat you might present less of a target but the weakest area of your body armor is also presented which is the sides where the two panels meet directly facing the threat might sound counterintuitive but it means better aim better follow up and better function of body armor source me cop
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i think it is a front up to present to a physical threat more the theatre of policing than an actual fire fight im assuming to from how close the instructor is its more of an old school assess position rather than mid course of fire kinda guessing who m knows what the going training was then eh
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,back in the day this wrist supported stance was pretty common it has since been replaced by the weaver and isosceles stances
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ah i see now thanks for explanation

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this show was a gold gem i wish in the near future someone does a remake
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ziggy says while a remake is not likely theres a chance you may end up becoming your younger self trying to stop your brother from going to war shit maybe i forgot to smack him hard on the sides two times sorry couldnt resist
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,loved this show would a remake really be any good without these two though
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,youre right maybe they can do a cameo on the first episode or throughout the first couple of episodes they can guide the new time travelers
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,his marinara sauce isnt too bad either

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sorry im so late on this just wanted to say i followed your gp but in reverse did my tour in vietnam and then chilled in panama actually the old canal zone for a couple years before coming back to the us if hes still with you tell him i said howdy and i hope he has some good memories from the days when we were giants on the face of the earth
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,haha exactly but no he actually had very blonde hair the camera was a polaroid and i think it just developed a little weird you can see his right hand is kind of grey as well that or its just faded not exactly sure
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and to think he was my age going into it it blows my mind thanks for checkin it out
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tet offensive started in
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive heard quite a lot of stories from his time there he owned a pet monkey ill have to ask him for the name again and witnessed the modified gunship named spooky aka puff the magic dragon in action when his base came under attack in the dead of night edit his monkeys name was rutherford p dildo the third chief warrant officer you cant make this stuff up lol pictures of spooky he said they called it the red dragon for short you can see why in that last picture hes one of the sharpest people i know and has more stories than he can share im considering to start taping our conversations when he shares them with me and possibly making a sort of book about him and my grandma and their life of course im biased but hes the most interesting men ive ever had the pleasure of knowing im sure others would enjoy his stories too thanks for leaving your comment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ha nice comparison she probably had hair that short as well shes wearing some kind of clipon hair thing that was popular at the time
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes still with us years young ill relay the message thank you for your service sir
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dont correct me it sickens me i was there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks for the info
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you can also partner with storycorps httpsstorycorpsorg
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i have seen videos of puff spewing fire and death from above soundtrack courtesy of the doors you are not biased he is an interesting guy and this will be lost forever if someone doesnt take an interest i will sign a non disclosure agreement if he tells us what he was really doing there
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i was gonna say did everyones relative have a pet monkey in nam but then i read the name of said money people in the lunch room are looking at me weird for laughing now great photo cool car and cool gramps what did he do in the war
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ive never heard of this before neat thanks sir
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hes a funny guy glad he could make you laugh haha i havent asked about exactly what he did but i know he was in intelligence i need to ask him more questions about it but i guess ive always felt like its a sensitive subject i know he lost all his hearing in his left ear from a close proximity grenade explosion but i guess hes never really been hesitant to tell me about stuff so i should just ask him more and get it documented
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im just curious he says he was in intelligence but obviously he wasnt a desk jockey so perhaps he was inattached to some of the more special units forgive me hack vietnamese history nerd here haha
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i did some quick research and realized i remembered the patch he had on his left shoulder i believe this indicated what division you were in the patch was an eagle talon grasping a lightning bolt after a little searching i found it was for the united states army security agency and after a little reading up on that i found that asa personnel were attached to army infantry and armored cavalry units throughout the vietnam war some teams were also attached to the studies and observation group of military assistance command vietnam and special forces units wikipedia dont know how to do the whole quoting thing on reddit but basically he couldve been based on the fact that he saw action on the field its not hard to imagine he was involved in some crazy stuff wonder if he has the clearance to tell me everything edit link to a pic of his patch
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,macvsog is sort of what i was curious about itd be pretty wild if he was attached to them
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,could you elaborate for me please
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,just that i have read lots about them over the years and it wasnt till well after the war had ended that they were even widely known about if you want to read into some very interesting history look them up

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,where was this was he a prisoner
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,colorizebot
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this was back at the hospital he crash landed into german territory and fractured his spine and some ribs he saw a german truck approaching the crash site and knew they were going to kill him so the only thing he could think to do was play dead they found him and tied him to the back of their truck and dragged him just for the sake of being cruel to what they thought was his dead body finally the red cross truck was driving through the battlefield to pick up injured and dead and the rules of war required the axis not to interfere so they cut him from the back of the truck and drove off the red cross picked him up thinking it was another corpse but were shocked when he started talking to them this picture is him after getting out of the hospital with a body cast he went back to do more missions for a total of which as far as i know is the most glider missions done by a single pilot since most werent really expected to survive beyond or because the gliders werent built very well and pretty much every landing was a crash landing

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what kind of nazi uniform ss or wehrmacht or something else
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the first years of the war were relatively calm my grandparents lived in the occupied netherlands their everyday life didnt change very much after the german occupation and neither did the lives of most of the general population that would have been the same in germany itself eventually that did change of course
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not a specialist but i dont recall wehrmacht uniforms having a swastika but i can be wrong a uniform specialist could tell you in an instance what kind it is edit on closer look the swastikas are on a bandage that could be a ssuniform post the pics to historyporn im sure you get an answer soon
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i agree they look very much alike btw the ss uniforms were hugo boss design

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and the idiots with no brain will vote for this worthless trash
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,waits patiently
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what an incredibly classy comment
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i know right
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is so cool very sad it would be thrown out what do you plan to do with it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,cool that you saved itsad that it was thrown presumably there was no family left to pass it on to
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what an amazing find so beautiful and i love that they look happy for real if you do decide to sell it pm me i cant make any promises but id love a shot at it wicked cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,super cool i feel like the man you described as the grooms father is possibly the best man in the larger group photo theres a man to the right of the groom whos older that may be his father also anyone notice in the larger group photo the group of kids on the right kind of random
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the church has a distinctive stained glass window which i would expect to find photos of on the internet edited to add the pointed arch door with ornate wrought iron hinges is quite distinctive too reminds me of arundel cathedral try cross posting to rwhereisthis edit very similar to east window of st mary chilham kent httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilliamwaileschurchescontainingstainedglassbywilliamwailes edit as these photos seem postworld war and the stained glass looks mostly intact i would suggest this church or cathedral is not located in london or other area which was bombed edit very similar to tewkesbury abbey httpwwwtherosewindowcompilottewkesburyewframehtm
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my nan lives in dagenham im sure she has done her whole life i know its a big place but i could ask her if she knows them where was the skip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,he is so cute
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,she looks so happy cutting her cake
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,what is a skip
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the girl all the way on the left kind of looks like jennifer lawrence
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did you look on the back of the photos
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the groom looks dandy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,solved st margarets plumstead demolished in the photos had travelled only miles from the church in plumstead to the skip in dagenham solved by graham maxwell on flickr yesterday
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the church looks like a lot of catholic churches near me i dont know the amount of catholic churches in england though i would guess its low theres probably more protestant churches only brits i know who are catholic are of irish decent
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hate to disappoint but most churches look like the one in the photo i can think of several in the small area that i live in in kent england they are all old with original stained glass and pointy doors if you are lucky you will find one with an original lead font too im sure i saw a font in the pictures i guess we are really fortune to live in an area of history i really do hope the album goes to a good home
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,im guessing that is the best man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ill probably put it on ebay not so much to make money but to make sure that it goes to a good home perhaps to somebody who collects old photos museums dont take personal photographs unless they are of historic events or famous people
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,possibly or it could be that the remaining family took anything of any value from the house jewellery cash documents etc and left the rest for the council to chuck in the skip it was mostly furniture and carpets but there was a box of broken glassware and ornaments which is where i found this album
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,tilney road near dagenham heathway station i found it about months ago but i moved house and its been in a box since then
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a dumpster
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes i checked the back of all of them for names or dates but they are all blank
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,take it to a local church they should be able to point you to the church featured who should be able to help you find the owners ebay would be a terrible crime as it could go to anyone anywhere and will probably never return to the owners
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,it might have been tucked away in the back of a cupboard and missed i guessed good luck finding a home for it would be really neat if you managed to get it to its rightful family and they thought theyd lost it
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks any idea why skip is used to refer to a dumpster
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,as to datenone of the men are wearing exservice mens badges and the groom seems to be wearing a new double breasted suit which would not have been available under war time rationing of clothes so at least or years post war round about mid i think jim b
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks for the advice i will have a look at local churches in the area and try and locate which one it is
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that would be a perfect solution but because the front page is blank it will be incredibly difficult unless somebody recognises somebody in the photos as their grandfather grandmother or great aunt etc
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thanks

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes if i had to organise a guitar band it would feature les paul bb and albert king dick dale link wray and lonnie mack all stars but quite different in their own styles and eras of the above i would rate lonnie mack as the most inventive player link wray was the one who made the power chord famous with rumble in dick dale for absolute longevity still touring and creating the whole surfer sound that was copied by so many others who else to open the sound track on pulp fiction bb was the guy with the smooth but raunchy delta sound who hitch hiked from indianola mississipi to chicago blues boy indeed albert was in a class of his own not so much as a singer but a master of the bar blues les could play with any body and make them look good chet atkins said that les taught him the humbucking style of picking makes the current crop look like rank amateurs except for maybe zz top best all round man bar band ever to come out of texas i say jim b
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i love it well stated my favorite living guitar slingers are steve miller when he gets down live hes amazing clapton duke robillard and chris vachon roomful of blues

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,this is obersturmbannfuhrer otto weidingerhe is a knights cross with oaks leaves and swords holder besides being a commander of a very well known ss combat regiment he also started as a camp guard at dachau in the ssvt here he is later in life this is a bundesarchiv photographfrom the german archives can you provide proof that he is your great grandfather it should be pretty easy to prove i study and collect german photos and would like to speak with you if this is truly your opa
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why are you idiots posting pictures of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiottoweidinger and claiming theyre your
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wtf
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sorry to hear your greatgrandfather was a nazi hope you do better in life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,hilarious thank you
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes it is just because he served for the germans it isnt a neat photo
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,times have changed my man trumps in charge meet the new cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the ss were monsters
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the atomic bomb or bombing of german cities was not a crime httpswwwwikiwandcomeninternationalcriminalcourt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,its pretty obvious youre just spamming with a stock internet photo and a copycat title not to mention the fact that your account is two years old but this post and this comment are the only activities classic spammer
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yes i agree a lot of war crimes committed by the ss you must remember that not all ss were associated with the camps thoughthe waffen ss were combat units who still committed war crimes the photograph is still pretty neat though all i was saying their uniforms were top notch and no they werent designed by hugo bossthats a myth people
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i just mind the posters bringing that fierce and flashy tippedhat game straight outta title
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh i agreenever said he was cool however as a collector i find the photo to be oldschool cool history is history and some are fascinated by all sides such as myself and yes i knew exactly who he was he was the commander of ss panzergrenadier regiment as i ided him earlier in the thread and yes i know all about the tulle massacres you make it seem like this was german soldiers were brutally killed and humiliated postmortum i obviously dont condone any crimes by the ss but in reality they were soldiers at war their comrades were brutally killed by partisans who knew they would be playing with fire by doing so and they certainly knew reprisals were to be expected in those times a death caused by partisans or villagerslocals was taken very seriously by the germans and russians as well and would almost always result in the deaths of many to set an example kondamari massacre etc here are the graphic details of the massacre on the germans at tulle for anyone interested on june when the town of tulle was retaken by armored reconnaissance battalion das reich the bodies of at least german soldiers of iii regiment were found in front of their billet what had once been a school horribly mutilated and terribly mauled according to the eyewitness accounts of the inhabitants of the town the german soldiers had surrendered to the maquisards after the latter had set fire to the school building they had laid down their weapons and come out with their hands raised but then they had been shot down in front of the building the final total was german soldiers killed some corpses still wore gasmasks which had supposedly been put on because of smoke in the building inhabitants of tulle reported that the maquisards among whom there had been poles red spaniards and even four russians in uniform had driven over german soldiers who were still alive with their lorries the bodies were in part mutilated beyond recognition on one of the corpses it was discovered that a hole had been bored through both heels and a rope threaded through apparently the soldier had been dragged along by a lorry in this way until he was dead because his face bore terrible injuries the dead had several bullet holes in them mostly in the back and the back of the head women accompanying the maquisards had according to one female resident thrown excrement over the bodies of the german soldiers some sort of gruesome orgy seemed to have been celebrated after the massacre judging by the broken wine bottles with the maquisards playing football with the german helmets the genitals of some of the dead had been cut off and stuffed into their mouths
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in his booklet weidinger claims that the maquisards french resistance fighters did not qualify as belligerents nor as legal combatants because they never bore a certain mark of distinction which was required for legal combatants nor did they observe the laws and customs of warfare in what they did instead the french resistance did quite the contrary according to weidinger who wrote that the french resistance fighters acted inhumanly sic in nearly everything they did the german soldiers who fell into the hands of maquisards were by no means treated as prisoners of war instead they came to a terrible end weidinger claims that the maquisards violated article of the hague convention with regard to the treatment of sick and wounded soldiers who were captured he wrote that the communist maquisards were guilty of the foul killing of members of the enemy german nation or army this is a reference to the burning of german wounded in an ambulance an incident that took place just outside the village of oradoursurglane shortly before the waffenss troops arrived there on the way into the village the commander of der fÃ¼hrer regiment sturmbannfÃ¼hrer adolf diekmann had discovered the remains of a german medical squad and four wounded german soldiers who had apparently been burned alive in an ambulance the driver and the man beside him had been chained to the steering wheel and had also been burned alive other violations of the hague convention by the maquisards according to weidinger included the murder of four military policemen the murder of german soldiers in tulle and the murder of german railway and medical personnel and that alone in the billeting area of das reich division according to international law which was in effect up until the geneva convention of it was legal to violate the laws of war by responding with a reprisal in order to stop guerrilla actions that were against international law a point which weidinger alludes to in his booklet but does not spell out

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the immigration facilities at ellis island were actually constructed in response to the rapidly increasing numbers of immigrants coming to the us in part due to technological advancements in shipbuilding before the federal government largely took no role in regulating immigration so while they are often seen as symbols of greater openness they could also be interpreted as an attenuating reaction to one of the early leaps in globalism perhaps they could be viewed as a balanced reaction to a heated topic the likes of which is unlikely to occur in todays political climate i worry
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,you forgot to mention that kid literally grew up to be hitler and his dad was bin laden and his mom was the mom who gave birth to the entire band of creed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and had to pass a physical before they were allowed off that island you know kinda of like vetting
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,bet they are catholic

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fun fact vivian vance and william frawley loathed each other
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,looks like a rollerderby promo poster
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah theres a series coming on ae about it soon not to be confused with the one about joan rivers this one is written and produced by frank fritz the guy from american pickers so it will probably be pretty true to life
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,never would have guessed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,fun fact vivian vance and lucille ball also loathed each other
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,dunno who would keep down voting you but i think that wouldve made a great i love lucy episode
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,that would be awesome
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no there isnt stop lying frank fritz is no where as cool as you think
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,never worry about downvotes unless theyre at the very least in double digits people disapprove of shit for a myriad of reasons but its just one or two or four people anonymously clicking a button but ha makes me almost wish for a reboot except i know id regret wishing for it as soon as the first episode aired
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,whats up with the downvotes i took that as a positive comment reddit is weird sometimes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i have a friend whos just starting in a derby league actually and this is a fantastic suggestion
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,definitely lucille is my girl no one will ever be able to do her justice though i do love the whole housewifepinup girl theme and would love to see a new series that captured that annnd queue the feminist downvotes
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a housewife is like a feminists anti christ i see it as a way of life from a different and maybe more naive society but they see it as being a slave to the male race im all for equality dont get me wrong but i sure would love to be a housewife that only had to worry about cooking cleaning and looking pretty for when my man came home but maybe thats just me
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,a very cool hobby and way to spend your time what state
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i guess im not getting the feminist downvote thing lucille ball was a powerhouse i never for once thought that show was about desi i thought she played to the ideal but turned it on its head a little bit as much as you could do in the actual i felt like she played a character but in her personal life she was completely in control of the show and she was a powerful woman that totally outshined desi she was a comedienne above all she was limited by the constraints of the time but i felt like she took that idea about the woman being inferior and ridiculous and stupid and made it a parody real life she was fierce
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,taxachusetts i cant wait to see a match
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,oh for sure i like that you called her a powerhouse thats exactly what she was i dont mean that show specifically catered to the ideal housewife but people at least where im from associate shows and women from that era as being enslaved by men and disregarded as intelligent or equal beings simply because of their gender its a feminist tug of war around here you cant say anything without it being a direct hit to womens rights and im a woman its a very confusing generation
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,enjoy great way to spend a tipsy evening different type of crowd man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,i hear you black dude here but you never know what some people will consider offensive or not is x playing into a harmful stereotype or is it just an example of a mindset from the y era what constitutes choice vs whats just the result of an oppressive system what parts of older culture are ok am i allowed to enjoy billie holiday without focusing on how fucked her circumstances were yes celebrate the lights that shone as well as lamenting the bulbs that never got lit up im drunk as shit and this was the worst metaphor ive come up with in

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,history is full of strange coincidences and the civil war is no exception in the stefan lorant was researching a book on abraham lincoln when he came across an image of the presidents funeral procession as it moved down broadway in new york city the photo was dated april at first it appeared like one of any number of photographs of lincolns funeral procession until he identified the house on the corner as that of cornelius van schaack roosevelt the grandfather of future president teddy roosevelt and his brother elliot the coincidence might have ended there but lorant took a closer look in the secondstory window of the roosevelt mansion he noticed the heads of two boys are peering out onto lincolns funeral procession lorant had the rare chance to ask teddy roosevelts wife about the image and when she saw it she confirmed what he had suspected the faces in the windows were those of a young future president and his brother yes i think that is my husband and next to him his brother she exclaimed that horrible man i was a little girl then and my governess took me to grandfather roosevelts house on broadway so i could watch the funeral procession but as i looked down from the window and saw all the black drapings i became frightened and started to cry theodore and elliott were both there they didnt like my crying they took me and locked me in a back room i never did see lincolns funeral

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,read paul fussells the boys crusade or any work by vonnegut for an insight to having kids fighting a war right out of high school even though they are focusing on world war ii what they have to say applies to the american experience from the civil war forward all young men are changed by their service my ninety five year old father will sit and talk about being in the navy and being stationed on okinawa during the last months of the war in by the way they were all happy the atomic bombs were dropped since they all expected to die in the invasion of japan they were prepping for if you want a great work on vietnam read tim obriens the things they carried this has become standard reading in high school english classrooms across the united states

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,old school not cool
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sometimes this hits me really hard im now and to think that my life could have been over right now if i lived in a different time period is crazy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,war is always with kids
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ask him if hell do psychs again seriously many guys say it really helps recovery
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my dad was infantry and he was ptsd and contracted hep c which killed him he had anger issues for most of my life and drank to the point where i swore i would never drink after experiencing his drunken anger for years he came to terms with it later in life and had things straightened somewhat before he died
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,my dad enlisted and was there he was an alcoholic the ptsd is bad enough but then you have to factor in the agent orange exposure he had health problems and both my brother and i have birth defects there was a bill that passed that will have the va going back and heather in birth defect info i didnt know anything was wrong with me until i was
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,sorry to hear that my dad didnt get messed up too bad he was a pilot saw some bad stuff but did not develop ptsd ive met some of his buddies at the reunions though who definitely have it some getting treatment some not
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,the resemblance is uncanny
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,did not expect to see ltt leaking over here

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,was drafted in dec average age of my basic training company was years and months httpswwwraticalorgratvillecahwarisarackethtml though the army did later issue me a httpcybersdcomsd and it did pay me a day to walk a mile perimeter each night in the jungle
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,kids fighting old men wars that is why a free not set up program by greedy government education is so important if you think you can save or protect your country by going abroad to kill people you are wrong and have been brainwashed
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,why what did you stand to gain from posting that honestly curious
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,psychedelics he takes his sobriety very seriously so he wouldnt do that hes never tried antidepressants though if thats what you meant
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,theyre using mdma also to treat ptsd and other related conditions its what it was originally used for
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,yeah i went crazy with drugs but never alcohol i will not go down that path
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,thats so awful luckily my dad doesnt have any agent orange related issues i couldnt imagine being fucked up physically as well as mentally and then passing that on to your kids jesus
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well excuse me mr history man
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,no they didnt
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,savage
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,probably killing your grandparents typical onesided ignorant comment you ever stop to think he might have been helping them as some vietnam vets have told me about my brother for one where they put themselves between the vc attacking a village with unarmed civilians in it yeah thats right vietnamese against vietnamese you want to point fingers at then point at the fucked up governments yeah all of them who see fit that their ideologies are so fuckin righteous they have to have people kill each other over
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,but many and many kids are so happythey are warriors then they scream and cry
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,stick to her son
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,and the forearms on that boy
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,war with kids reminded me of this song as it talks about kids with guns nothing to gain from posting it but its a good song thats relevant to the comment made
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,psychedelics like mushrooms have given those suffering from anxiety and depression considerable relief in some cases i think that may have been what they meant antidepressants saved my life but the side effects were horrible
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,not really
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,well maybe her grandparents are vc its like chance
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,can you expand on the sideeffects
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,psychedelics for that purpose are meant to be taken in a clinical environment taking them outside of that environment can be very hit or miss especially if youre talking about someone suffering from ptsd
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,if he rarely talks about it im going to guess an ama is a no go
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,maybe her grandparents are vc if so then i manup admit my erroneous assumption you maybe even with the downvotes shes be given will chime in with more facts
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,wait i thought we were talking about the son
OldSchoolCool,not_removed,ama with a japanese game show

OldSchoolCool,not_removed,in at a louisville and nashville railroad roundhouse located in pensacola fl an accident occurred consolidation no steadily started to creep forward slowly most likely due to a leaky throttle the front of the engine soon fell into the open turntable pit rearing its rear end upward as well as its front end of the tender up as well two more engines are trapped in the roundhouse as engine has now blocked the turning abilities of the turntable right now you can see some workers lifting up the heavy engine by slowly cranking up the front and inserting some wood ties for support this would continue until the engine can be brought back to ground level and the turntable cleared to continue operation
