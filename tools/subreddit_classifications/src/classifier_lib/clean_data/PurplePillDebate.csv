PurplePillDebate,removed,because you play with yourself at night
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh im sorry i didnt see that it was you who posted this otherwise i wouldnt have replied
PurplePillDebate,removed,spoken like a woman whos never been a man and who has never loved a woman what youre forgetting here is wife goggles a man values youth and beauty and who also is worth half a shit and has some character himself also values the mindset and character of the woman who gave the best she had to him if a woman is marrying a man who values only her youth and beauty and isnt worth a shit then thats on her a man might be unhappy if she gets older but hes not going to hold it against her or discard her what makes men really unhappy is when a wife gets so fat she becomes physically unappealing or unable to have sex what makes men really unhappy is when she stops giving a shit about her physical appearance
PurplePillDebate,removed,but but men are supposed to be the true romantics and love unconditionally oh well then
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have no time for people who dont read what i write
PurplePillDebate,removed,try reading the comments you need to work on comprehension
PurplePillDebate,removed,the first and heres why
PurplePillDebate,removed,girl no invent anything
PurplePillDebate,removed,it means shes not interested and smarter than you move on you arent worth her time
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh wow you sure do have it all figured out you must tell women exactly what they are really thinking even when they dont like you must be like a mind reader predicting exactly what is going to happen before it does and stuff
PurplePillDebate,removed,lesbian
PurplePillDebate,removed,it sounds like a small child pouting
PurplePillDebate,removed,im curious to hear what rp men have to say as a woman let me say that i can spot manipulation tactics right away i wont get hostile i feel like only a woman who is losing control of the situation will blow up i may ignore one or two inappropriate comments to see if he truly is a jerk then i politely cut the interaction short and leave i just dont have time for it i gotta wonder what kind of women are responding to the rp or the similar pua manipulation probably less secure less emotionally stable maybe not too bright
PurplePillDebate,removed,notice how the bp men and women in the comment section find this common notice how those comments that mention this being common got many upvotes therefore it is safe to assume that if bp men are stating this is common it is common they are just having a difficult time explaining it under bp talk but at least they are admitting this common strategy employed by many women bp denial on ppd is the only method i can see to answering this question because it can only be truly explained by red pill
PurplePillDebate,removed,i highly doubt any level of evidence would persuade you that this is common you are employing the bp method of denial it is the only tactic possible in this clearly common mating strategy of women
PurplePillDebate,removed,dude bloopies are just dodging the question no point in insisting too bad because i would love to hear a blue pill explanation for this scenario that literraly appears all the fucking time and with most women i personally know
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol at least we admit that red pill explains this much better than bp bravo on that
PurplePillDebate,removed,thanks for confirming afbb strategy for american women bravo to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yup afbb confirming red pill thanks again for playing
PurplePillDebate,removed,the bp explanation is that there is no explanation shit happens there is no reason for it your observations are meaningless because you havent dont a full government funded study with double blind control groups so it is just wallowing in ignorance to see any pattern in human behavior
PurplePillDebate,removed,resource acquisition is strongly implied by in the comment section the rest of your argument is just gibberish that doesnt explain away the clear afbb strategy employed her by the female and her attempt to keep it secret from her beta bucks boyfriend that is why he is so hurt when he finds out on a biological level
PurplePillDebate,removed,bitter and salty like tears mixed with mountain dew in you parents basement
PurplePillDebate,removed,goodgood let the hate flow through you
PurplePillDebate,removed,he was fired over the feminist issue stop the bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol cool story bro the difference is there is no afbb paradigm that is possible for men men dont frequently require women for provisioning through marriage when they get older and their smv drops ergo there is no analogous situation
PurplePillDebate,removed,few bps offer observations when they do theyre often wrong because theyre viewed through the bp mindset
PurplePillDebate,removed,you just keep on believing that if it makes you feel better hope that consoles you when your gf leaves you for the hawt alpha because you just dont do it for her anymore
PurplePillDebate,removed,and none of the things i willingly do with my husband were things that i would have felt comfortable doing with my ex given your stories i think you are even less representative than women who settle for a guy they arent really into
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice rationalization that avoids the concept of the article lol bps get credit for the hamsterization of their arguments truly awe inspiring lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,aww the frequency fallacy is the last straw of blue pill yet the afbb paradigm with declining smv value is clearly true in this segment of women this paradigm is not given any credence in bp thought
PurplePillDebate,removed,yup learned about it from blues blues tell us everyones a special snowflake nothing can ever really be known they look at the same thing i do and say its just a complicated situation theyre different itll be ok
PurplePillDebate,removed,the entitled comments are mostly from feminist western women that dont want to do anything for the husbandboyfriend so she claims he isnt entitled yet she still feels entitled to him providing money paying for dates etc its all about traditional gender values for the men while women have no obligations to the male i never hear men talking about how women arent entitled until very recently
PurplePillDebate,removed,spoken like someone who doesnt know or doesnt care about emotional abuse nothing more to say in that case so sure okay
PurplePillDebate,removed,they treat the men they love worse and with less respect than they would treat a stranger yes yes yes but no one calls them on it no one
PurplePillDebate,removed,yup you are right and women arent entitled to commitment or resources from a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,hahahaha this is fucking gold
PurplePillDebate,removed,if she were attracted to him she would be sucking his cock love is a by product of attraction and thus she cannot possibly love him given their ages he should just divorce her
PurplePillDebate,removed,i accept it all apart from paedophilia and cuckfetishes
PurplePillDebate,removed,being rich isnt the strategy getting involved with rich men despise being disgusted by them is the strategy
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck you it is rp
PurplePillDebate,removed,it got to the point that giving one lost its appeal and intimacy for her she knows this isnt the case with me but she is still having a hard time getting past that mentally obvious bullshit because received blow jobs his first week sexually active with his wife if they actually lost appeal and intimacy for her in her last relationship she wouldnt have given them out like candy when she started dating her current husband
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one is entitled to anything they didnt personally pay for
PurplePillDebate,removed,mobile thanks for autocorrecting for me also i edited some paragraphs make sure you catch those
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont know why you think a its important in someway to my original comment b how anyone is suppose to know your sex though your username c why anyone would want to know your sex in the first place are you here to pick up trpers or seeking some validation
PurplePillDebate,removed,then stop putting out low hanging fruit seriously why do you care if someone thinks you are a man or a woman i dont care why should you i said the original comment because it rhymed and is a common saying not everything on ppd needs to be taken seriously get over yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,gets so weird right out of the gate who are these people
PurplePillDebate,removed,you seem mad is it pms would you like a hot beverage
PurplePillDebate,removed,haha nothing is risky for women they are sheltered from all consequences the only thing at risk is men by women who have complete institutional power
PurplePillDebate,removed,translation men cannot film record or in any way prove their innocence they should continue to have zero way to prove an encounter was consensual and continue to be at risk of a false accusation and be able to be jailed and have their life ended from a womens accusation
PurplePillDebate,removed,everything is sexist everything is racist and you have to point it all out
PurplePillDebate,removed,you know youre raping and objectifying them by staring at them too long
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol no not at all feminists hate men and have penis envy
PurplePillDebate,removed,shhhhh women read the internet dum dum
PurplePillDebate,removed,why would they even the ugly ones get plenty of messages
PurplePillDebate,removed,youve already outted yourself as someone who has paid for male prostitutes try not to talk down to others so much
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats nice dear
PurplePillDebate,removed,the fact that you would need to consider this means that youre in a position far inferior to even you average beta male all women in that category are usually very bitter and choose to lash out at men for the injustice of their lot
PurplePillDebate,removed,men who are not happy do not like seeing younger men who are happy you seriously think that get some therapy if thats the case i dont know anyone with that mentality its obscene even to consider it as a possibility suggests something is out of whack
PurplePillDebate,removed,i did not mean to dishonor the young mlady
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol arms young men with the tools do you realize how corny you sound let me let you in on a little secret you are genetically inferior most men are not meant to reproduce most women are the top of attractive men are at the top in the sexual marketplace all women are in the middle the other of men you are here are below most of you arent meant to reproduce you are supposed to be evolutionary dead ends women will never truly desire you no matter what you do
PurplePillDebate,removed,you do old man i dont make the truth i only speak on it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do silently enjoy when other people think my so is attractive rp confirmed
PurplePillDebate,removed,no
PurplePillDebate,removed,it can be disrespectful ive felt what you describe before and it was disgusting because i was doing my job he had a faithful and enthusiastic sexual partner and it was just scummy you lose that leg to stand on when you know good and well youve said no to sex with your husband for a month running and dont give a shit about what its doing to him
PurplePillDebate,removed,guys i found the unicorn
PurplePillDebate,removed,how will he respond to his clear contradiction archwinger is pointing out im going with ad hominem
PurplePillDebate,removed,rp is just observing reality without femenist filters so yeah rp confirmed
PurplePillDebate,removed,if i had to guess hes calling out people speaking from both sides of their mouth at once to see if its substance or just empty so far i dont blame him
PurplePillDebate,removed,posts that will get removed inflammatory the red pill is stupid wtf who the fuck made this rule
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats the literally the dumbest ive ever read in this sub this sub is about debating interpreting the moot is part of the debate and fleshing out the argument ie variants of the question is also part of debate not only is sussing out what the op is trying to ask wise it is the very essence of debate
PurplePillDebate,removed,exactly right real men react to what women do not the other way around men who think for themselves are effeminate losers
PurplePillDebate,removed,women respecting men in modern marriages yeah ill believe it when i see it
PurplePillDebate,removed,why do trpillers blame women for nearly everything because everything is womens fault trp is truth because i get to dictate what reality is for everyone else hope that helps clear some things up for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,no
PurplePillDebate,removed,exactly right women should respect men even when they dont deserve it men must not under any circumstance treat a woman with the respect she deserves why because trp is truth uredpillstool everyone concurs
PurplePillDebate,removed,is this some lets read together bonding thing
PurplePillDebate,removed,all the women are telling us they dont like it so i guess that settles it always listen to what they say and completely ignore how they behave got it
PurplePillDebate,removed,so my feelz
PurplePillDebate,removed,women destroyed society with a lot of help from blue pill manginas and white knights the fuck is this hahahahaa ubluepillprofessor all the weakest people in society conspired to destroy it you guyz get exposed faggot
PurplePillDebate,removed,the male ideal during the feminist was kinda girlish or androgynous
PurplePillDebate,removed,women would rather be in a kings harem than have a loser exclusively but they would also rather have that king to themselves than share and they will use every tool available to them to make that king thing believe in monogamy i think right now society is swinging back to polygamy and harems most alphas now have open soft harems
PurplePillDebate,removed,see what i mean most of you can barely understand syntax or language you have no reading comprehension ability i never said all men are bad i said the overwhelming majority of you are bad
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are asking the wrong people women will always claim they wont but put them in front of a really good looking bloke acting like a fucking arsehole and they will only see his positive traits and make excuses for the rest this is where redpill gets its mistaken belief that you have to act like an arsehole to get women from they see good looking guys acting like it and assume its the behaviour that is the cause of their success the truth is that if you follow rules and you can pretty much act however you want and still have women falling at your feet go on tinder with a fake profile picture if you want the proof you can be as cringey dirty awkward and insulting as you want it makes little difference
PurplePillDebate,removed,why is this a question you see thousands of women throw themselves at famous actors musicians athletes etc think those women care that said man is sleeping with other women or that many of them are standing next to each other women would rather be in a superstars harem than be exclusive with a monkey
PurplePillDebate,removed,and yet you have time to waste on reddit lol no if your man was alpha his dick would be so great that you wouldnt have time to waste on reddit on a weekend youd be out hiking or something just out of sheer happiness at best you just have a fake alpha who you really arent attracted to feel down but hell do
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont tend to see this same urge in women though uuh what women fuck guys they hate all the time hes the bad boy that will change his ways for them
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not that hard for me to get women ha any man can pay women for sex uworldsendgirlfriend is right on point about your delusions of success with women nonhookers are out of your reach because no woman is going to get past your hateful toxic views about our gender you can try to hide that part of yourself but its seeps out and women bail on you for the same reason i find it hard to believe with your attitude you could maintain fwb which seems to be the arrangement of choice for women who have casual sex one nighters with a drunk girl in the bar may be doable if your average looking but keep doing that and one day youll get hit with a rape charge from a chick who sobers up and feel upset
PurplePillDebate,removed,i get to add whatever question i want to any discussion i want you must have me confused for someone who cares what you think
PurplePillDebate,removed,couldnt have said it better she knows what you mean but she is purposefully pretending ignorance because it doesnt fit her narrative so typical
PurplePillDebate,removed,your reading comprehension sucks thats a fact not my fault
PurplePillDebate,removed,chad will have stretched her out i always love when jaded cynics know as much about womens anatomy as a pissed off grader his beautiful hard cock or get a glow while talking about chads anatomy how will she stay with the beta male if his cock is only or learn everything they know about normal human anatomy from porn or long term relationships for that matter they reminisce about how amazing chads body was httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvabsrtuoidsc
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you dont like millenials why are you on a website made for young people the retirement home is down the road
PurplePillDebate,removed,i suppose thats the way it looks to folks whod need to pay someone to put up with their personality for that long
PurplePillDebate,removed,says the guy who hates women because he cant fuck a new disney princess every night
PurplePillDebate,removed,all of the women i know are feminists oh god fate worse than death sounds like the premise to a dystopian horror novel
PurplePillDebate,removed,question was for women only bro
PurplePillDebate,removed,and then they wonder why they never interact with interesting women since this thread is basically a reheated version from two days before ill just keep this short no one from trp will state this nor did anybody what you think is interesting is really not interesting but quite probably a red flag for somebody from trp things that make a women interesting are being feminine soft submissive and nurturing being attractive dressing consistent with your sex being fit thinks that arent being badmouthed knowitall masculine bossy being a landwhale dressing like a dude and walking like a cowboy a really valuable man does not care about you finding yourself interesting the things you little narcissist find interesting in you like believing you are outstandingly smart and witty he does not care for a valuable man already leads an intersting and exciting life what he needs is silence peace and somebody who is willing to build a place he can call home
PurplePillDebate,removed,upvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont try and argue with this mod shes pretty outwardly bp biased and will remove any mild attack in order to try and sway the discourse in bps favour she revels in her absolute power and hides behind the rules in order to pander to her team rp or neutral mods never remove the bp personal attacks jokes at whim they have us beat in the power structure remember even on here were fighting an uphill battle
PurplePillDebate,removed,let me get this straight dress better work out keep up your hygiene be more social get a better job and dont take shit from women will get you laid more and you need us to change your view on this
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah groovyefs you sick rapist o you claim that you aint a rapist then fucking prove it something something burder of proof lies with me nah that cant be
PurplePillDebate,removed,umm i dont quite have an appropriate stock warning for this like i feel like this is edgelording but im just baffled at reading it
PurplePillDebate,removed,the data says they have less partners than people statistically less likely to have much in the way of selfdiscipline or able to marry into society you just decided theyre shut out of sex because it feeds your narrative and because you have the fucking hubris to tell us that sapiosexuals dont exist well fuck you im one of them and its bloody embarrassing at times
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know honey im sorry i hurt you by pointing out that youre not as triggering as you want to be are you going to be okay
PurplePillDebate,removed,its just a jumble of funny things and movies
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cannot on ine hand claim youre classy which doesnt even really mean anything in and on the other hand say your break up with someone because you dont like their dick which you never actually tried would it be equally classy for a man to claim he broke up with a woman he never got unclothed because he suspected her vagina lips were too meaty lol i strongly think not
PurplePillDebate,removed,complete moron if you think you can eliminate murder or violence or whatever lol at you
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont women make cents on the mans dollar or some bullshit i thought you are supposed to pay teenagers less
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sure those luminaries have it all figured out
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont hang out in your irc so i wouldnt know anything about the fight you had with your h and then it the next morning came up to you in a pleasant manner and was met with your response so you you finished menstruating yet im sure that would blow over well if a user posted they said that to their so when he was trying to make amends but whatever youre wingnut rp supremacy applies to everyone but you
PurplePillDebate,removed,people like you would make society shitty if someone is acting shitty it doesnt give you a right to act shitty so really youre just a child stooping to their level whatever makes you proud to be a human
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course youre stooping to their level thats exactly what youre doing youre just showing them youre just as shity as they are me i like being a good person maybe you dont
PurplePillDebate,removed,give me a scenario of someone acting shity also operant conditioning google it thats how you stop or increase behaviors so yelling at someone achieves nothing what youre doing is acting emotionally logically the person doing x has no effect on you so you ignore it unless its physical but then i just throw a fist thats how you get people off your back you are delusional
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre being too literal of course youre not allowed to take what twerps say at face value for what the words actually mean silly female busy alfalfa males dont have time to deal with petty things like accurate specific descriptions what they actually mean is that women are like teenagers even though they frequently take on loads of adult responsibilities and youre just supposed to accept that because we cry sometimes when were angry that obviously means were totally controlled by useless emotion and unable to make rational decisions
PurplePillDebate,removed,funny this is exactly how a teenager would act
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you act like a child so why do you care what they say about you logically their opinion is like an asshole everyone has one and they all full of shit emotional you feel attacked so you go on the offensive again showing youre more emotion vs logic in the same scenario i just make a witty one liner joke and walk away logically my time is more precious then wasting it throwing a temper tantrum yes ive seen adults act like children see youre emotional zero logic child mentality you throwing a temper tantrum makes you look worse then anything they said because now you also look like a raging emotional lunatic
PurplePillDebate,removed,ask any adult if you see adults yelling up a storm throwing dirt would you not view them both as equally bad also why does opinions of you matter if its personal life who cares youll lose half your friends over time if its career life well thats a great way to sacrifice your career and it does make you look worse in the eyes of people observing see you make society worse good jobl youre telling people acting how you act is ok and since more and more people are sensative you now get easily triggered sjws which you probably are one great job loser
PurplePillDebate,removed,disagree youre projecting your opinion of how others view things towards others you see a person who is insecure because they feel judged because they judge others is a catch people probably talk shit behind your back about how youre crazy and a bitch i know i would again you assume people listen to others when in reality people just nod and say yeah yeah and dont even pay attention when nut jobs talk you probably get lots of those conversations maybe the people will judge you based on their interactions with you and if they have been positive others words will not change that youre just a child who acts like a child
PurplePillDebate,removed,why hasnt this unmitigated garbage been taken down circle jerk strawman nonsense so much for your expanded rules
PurplePillDebate,removed,not everyone is the same ok some mms are blue and some are green who cares if they are all made of chocolate that doesnt matter the other day i also found a lumpy one thus this proves mms are not made of chocolate
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you must belive live what people tell you to think others do also what youre doing is great in high school but just wait
PurplePillDebate,removed,no we believe that and europe is a shining example of what happens when ya do
PurplePillDebate,removed,no thats highschool adults dont think that way thats how teenagers think which is why i think youre age range
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe you should read what you just wrote
PurplePillDebate,removed,its about what works if emotionally mature doesnt work why do it translation i throw tantrums and it gets me what i want yep sounds like a teenager emotional maturity doesnt work on the emotionally immature i stoop to others level and behave like the people i criticize or the people who want to use every excuse to make you look bad no one is persecuting you get over yourself a lot of people who yammer on and on about maturity are the same kinds of people who refuse to take responsibility for their actions and refuse to keep promises because of principle projecting hard here i see through a lot of peoples fake wisdom acts again this is something a teenager would say you are literally confirming what trp says keep going this is great
PurplePillDebate,removed,sad some people dont grow up
PurplePillDebate,removed,human mating strategy is a pseudo harem anima id not real life dude
PurplePillDebate,removed,biotrufs
PurplePillDebate,removed,starting to get the impression youre kindve nuts from your comments
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you agree that women cant be trusted thanks lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,everyone knows the guy in the a nine never actually gets to sleep with the girls in the harem
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a very retarded view but not quite as bad as that strawnan you just made that is not a strawman at best its a false dichotomy if you believe its wrong which its not i wouldnt mock a guy for having a small penis though id make small penis jokes aimed at no one in particular why this sounds retarded lol i do however think hurting someones feelings its good at best shaming bad behavior to rude at worst no one has the right to never be offended ok if i ever meet you ill stab you in the chest plate no one has the right to not be stabbed in the chest plate right see how easy that argument works its magical im not shaming men with the intents of changing anything im making a joke that isnt directed towards anyone you sound like you never mentally matured past old
PurplePillDebate,removed,atlas you are a gem you said youre part jew also so am i but i am ashamed at how our people are so liberal for people who pride themselves on being smart
PurplePillDebate,removed,that was the most graphic example of dodging the question i have ever seen i dont even know where to begin why are lower pitched voices more attractive than higher pitched voices
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are lower pitched voices more attractive than higher pitched voices
PurplePillDebate,removed,rot youre trying to soften red pill idiocy and everyone can see straight through it
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh so women get a free pass for murder when theyre feeling down poor diddums honestly men dont ever get these free passes never
PurplePillDebate,removed,because the patriarchy tricks women into preferring deep voices over higher pitched ones everybody knows that sexual preferences are a social construct as bluepillers and sjws succesfully proved s
PurplePillDebate,removed,please good sir answer the question posed to you in a civil and good faith manner why are lower pitched voices more attractive than higher pitched voices
PurplePillDebate,removed,one paradoxical effect of this overconcern about womens safety is that the supposedly strong and independent modern women are constantly worried about getting assaulted women who are perpetually scared of possible threats arent really strong independent and most importantly productive its a trade off for politicians and other elites between having a poweful tool of scaremongering propaganda as modern feminism is or having a female population whos really productive and enterprising if you read any major feminist discussion forum you can instantly sense how scared shitless they are about pretty much everything and in fact theyre gonna tell you that women currently dont have the right of walking down the streets feeling safe like men do
PurplePillDebate,removed,what do you mean he totally got us so clever s
PurplePillDebate,removed,thank you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes they do when it is convenient bookmarked this thread for future reference
PurplePillDebate,removed,this has nothing to do with being a man there is a difference between venting and entrenched pov for women too
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok so in a ten minute lockerroom convo people are coming up with extensive serious theories fam youre fulla shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck you whore
PurplePillDebate,removed,dick in vagina pleasure
PurplePillDebate,removed,great links one confirms that of women are cheating whores while the other are lying cheating whores
PurplePillDebate,removed,bout how much money a guy has about getting pregnant to keep a man or get his money about cheating on their men about not giving it up about dudes theyre actively friend zoning and dudes they rejected about dudes they are making wait and dudes they slept with on the first night uhhh yeah no one talks about this shit really sometimes we talk about whether a guys got and whether that impacts our attraction no ones ever like omg i met this guy and imma friendzone him yassss queens wtf is your mind try and get outside of it and into the sunshine that is reality itll do you good
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck you whore
PurplePillDebate,removed,i apologize for questioning your honor mlady i am sure you are not a disgusting filthy degenerate cheating whore like all other women
PurplePillDebate,removed,okay maybe all of your friends are super bitter losers i havent deleted any of my posts in response to you as far as i am aware it sounds like you think women dont think men are like gross fat chicks in private tho every single example youve raised is an example that every woman here has heard men say so you were going to differentiate between levels of bitterness but now youre saying theres no difference between trp and locker room talk entrenched bitter pov held as a result of perception of the world vs bitter venting or ribbing based on emotional response to particular situations thats the difference i havent changed my mind and i know that you dont get what im saying you never did i honestly dont think youre capable of understanding this distinction bc of the way your mind works thats okay youre not going to get it you do you most people do get this distinction tho
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao at some twerp trying to use amused mastery on me fucking candy ass bitch
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a nut bye
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont bother listening to shes got her head so far up her ass her very own post is an affirmation about the way average women feel she doesnt feel bad shes just virtue signaling to hamster away her own hypocritical standards women like this dont have height preferences they are requirements completely different and sexist by any feminist standard us short men have it much harder dont let her empty platitudes fool you its like telling a fat girl that shes not fat in order to comfort her body image issues and justify her gorging
PurplePillDebate,removed,the constant trashing of male height from women like you is what causes people to hurt themselves
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am currently raising a teen girl this might be the most depressing thing ive read in a while i really hope at some point your consider how your attitudes about women may affect her before its too late
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you fat
PurplePillDebate,removed,because hes not being left to his own devices also the idea of you raising a boy is depressing in and of itself god help him
PurplePillDebate,removed,apparently selfrespect and sanity makes one a relic if you want to be hip and cool get on your knees and apologize for what doesnt matter
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists revile gone with the wind most female authors suck most men will never read books written by women most female authors are niche guess this includes jane austen the bronte sisters virginia woolf j k rowling margaret atwood agatha christie isabel allende ayn rand mary shelley im sorry i need to go take a shower to wipe off all the brown that fell on me from the insurmountable amount of bullshit i have just read in your post
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes i know youre way too sophisticated for the two most beloved books of the century big intemallectual
PurplePillDebate,removed,but all that a feminist framework is can be summed up with everyone is equally human and everyones problems and experiences are equally valid fucking lol thats it everything follows logically from there and thats why i should get free contraceptives and stem tuition money
PurplePillDebate,removed,the guy is in a relationship with a woman less attractive than him and with a worse career they have sex to times a week hes had around sexual partners only one ons the rest were regular girlfriends
PurplePillDebate,removed,it should be obvious by now that antirp people dont care about unfortunate guys and their needs frankly they wouldnt care if struggling guys hung themselves as long as they shut up antirp people are mostly bullies who get a kick out of mocking and belittling virgins incels and omegas they see rp as a joke and the men who follow it as pathetic losers trying to act alpha
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre just a bitter commie
PurplePillDebate,removed,rp does not work at all just lol but what bp people say also does not work both of you guys are dumb as fuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes it must suck being such a loser cant say that i know the feeling i feel sorry for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre a heightist and a sizequeen you must be such a catch the best part of your hypocritical post is that you cant even live up to of what you are demanding from a guy personalitywise
PurplePillDebate,removed,why clean your room you can find everything in there already though you have a bunch of crap you have to throw out the useful things are right there off question is your hair blue by chance except for the inches at the roots of course
PurplePillDebate,removed,congrats your a shithead would you like a reward
PurplePillDebate,removed,it isnt really that cool of a story but i guess simple people are easily impressed
PurplePillDebate,removed,im surprised youre an incel back when i was single i used to fuck a passive snarky girl that sounded like you she was a lot of fun whats your cupsize i may have a plan to get you out of your cold streak
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure but why do women even need power fantasies anyway male power fantasies have always existed women should just do the logical rational thing and enjoy those fantasies instead s the tag really shouldnt be necessary but given where we are and what some people here actually believe
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont really give a shit what your twat finds creepy i used to when i was thats part of the attraction i guess not giving a damn
PurplePillDebate,removed,if pi was how would the world change can you give me specific examples i only know that it would be great

PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont know and i am not sure why it is relevant there are antifeminists at ppd but neither ppd or trp is a place where the idea is to discuss antifeminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,be more womanly woman good man bad
PurplePillDebate,removed,because ive never met a woman who was rejected over her height uglyaverage women get rejected attractive women of any height do not get rejected so it might not be the height that is holding you back
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why its good to get rid of the strawmen get rid of those that dont fit my view of feminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,obese coloured hair tumblr users who use taxpayer dollars to pay for birth control so they can give their bodies to chad ftfy
PurplePillDebate,removed,in fact i told her that her post is offtopic and she is taking it out of context yet being an obnoxious feminist she keeps repeating this point that education is empowering for women and is their greatest asset
PurplePillDebate,removed,its true bro i have seen girls with boyfriends whats keeping a tall woman from finding not only a boyfriend but also a boyfriend shes attracted to yeah
PurplePillDebate,removed,failure as in being attacked through sexist blatantly unconstitutional laws and then discovering that your side not only doesnt care but will ridicule you if you talk about it so we find the manosphere and join up the only group that actually cares about having sane laws your group is just a bunch of virtue signaling status seekers caught in a holiness spiral frankly its embarrassing that you cant even figure it out
PurplePillDebate,removed,women love being groped if they never got groped they wouldnt know they have a phat ass
PurplePillDebate,removed,httpswwwredditcomuservienluna that would just be silly
PurplePillDebate,removed,just grope them by the pussy i better use tic tacs just in case i start kissing them im automatically attracted to beautiful women i just start kissing them its like a magnet just kiss i dont even wait
PurplePillDebate,removed,you havent been groped properly
PurplePillDebate,removed,what are you smoking tonight please post links where rpers have ever said anything even remotely close to finding groping women acceptable cant tell if this is a shitpost or if youre just on something
PurplePillDebate,removed,why did i reply to you how about this you go look it up smart ass look up single motherhood rates compare them to single motherhood rates in look up divorce rates compare them to divorce rates in look up marriage rates compare them to marriage rates in look up how many kids grow up without a father in compare that to how many kids grew up without a father in then look up the correlation between single motherhood and crime rates then look up the correlation between sexual partners and the likelihood of divorce theres plenty of studies and data its all out there you sound like a moron though considering youd even argue against something thats painstakingly obvious in the first place you really do come across as an insufferable bitch so im not googling shit for you research it yourself then get back to me or dont get back to me actuallyplease dont get back to me im just going to ignore you at this point
PurplePillDebate,removed,interesting that rpwi is the odd one out on this with nothing left or saved for marriage the very definition deludes to an institution of nothing
PurplePillDebate,removed,because they are selfish pricks ofc because trp is amoral hur dur
PurplePillDebate,removed,insecurity degeneracy etc
PurplePillDebate,removed,werent you going to femsplain to me how i misunderstood that seems instead you just created a new op claiming everyone here was celebrating groping women thats a bit dishonest
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think op is being deliberately honest i called him out on the other thread by posting what feminists mean by teaching men to respect women spoiler its a bunch of rules for how men can be more subservient i asked for comparable examples of feminists telling women what to do to respect men the example he came up with was essentially rules for men but aimed at women dont let him think empowered women are bossy dont let him think feminism is anti male dont let him force you in to traditional gender roles etc i guess he got flustered because he immediately stopped commenting there
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes just making stuff up he got beaten up pretty badly in that respect women thread the other day and this is how hes compensating
PurplePillDebate,removed,op isnt great at providing sources
PurplePillDebate,removed,at this level of obtuseness i have to either assume youre trolling or retarded either way it doesnt make for a debate in good faith
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh sure he dropped the usual youre just too stupid to understand routine then ran
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats reserved for certain very steamy dance floors hahahahaha and here we go again enter the hamster now she admits that even she likes being groped at times even in public very steamy dance floors the hypocrisy of these women knows no bounds i rest my case
PurplePillDebate,removed,but the important thing is have you stopped beating your wife
PurplePillDebate,removed,men getting laid is an accomplishment women getting laid is easy as fuck they are being lazy and taking the easy way out sluts should just jump off a bridge
PurplePillDebate,removed,blue pill isnt a philosophy it is a satire sub aka cyber bullies and libtards mock other humans for their ideas and beliefs if reddit was serious about removing hate subs like fph coontown etc then tbp should be removed as well it serves no purpose other than to give shitty people some outrage porn to jerk off too while trying to justify their own shitty misandrist racist world view im say im purple because i am not prored but i am antiblue
PurplePillDebate,removed,you fuckers need to aspire to get a life in myself included xd some of yall should just go in a cage and lock yourself in there and never come back
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre just making up things as you go along the answer to all your questions is actually in your parent comment
PurplePillDebate,removed,sounds like you just read the situation wrong tbh she wasnt ready for the kiss more likely than a broader trend at play
PurplePillDebate,removed,jesus i hope a woman made that comment please if that was a guy he should just blow his brains out for being such a cuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,how am i a hypocrite the woman would bail people in relationships dont have to be with each other but its different when its a parent and child relationship i dont think you get that please dont have kids either if she was alive the situation might be a little different but not as much again he was her father i dont know how old the kid is but if she is like it might be a fucked up situation leaving the kid without the father shes known all her life i dont care about the feelings of either parent as much as i do the well being of the child again you might be a heartless monster but having a year long relationship with a child isnt something to sneeze at
PurplePillDebate,removed,does this hurt anyone elses head no because we arent retarded
PurplePillDebate,removed,ciswhitemaelstrom is actually steve bannon

PurplePillDebate,removed,when you make posts like this thats exactly what youll get
PurplePillDebate,removed,you act like a triggered girl so yeahthen you are a white knight
PurplePillDebate,removed,since hes an avid tbp poster he qualifies as a honorary female
PurplePillDebate,removed,remember guys how you feel is not important its how women feel so fuck yourself over so some girl can be happy and dont forget to witdraw bills from the atm machine and to randomly throw them at women because women deserves to be happy

PurplePillDebate,removed,i am just a man who wants to be loved just like women are if you kill yourself maybe youll reincarnate in that reality this isnt a snarky lol kill yourself comment im just commenting on the fact that this is a reality where that can never be achieved so maybe try the next one if you believe in such things
PurplePillDebate,removed,us nonchads have to accept our place in the world
PurplePillDebate,removed,cant wait until sex bots are a real thing so guys like you can shut the hell up my sister was going out with a douche for too long shes too nice and he took complete advantage she dumped his ass this week and i took her out for celebration drinks
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are a misogynist for wanting to hold women accountable for what for being sluts youre slutshaming for having careless sex and becoming single mothers youre misogynistic its not her fault the dad was a deadbeat also we need more abortion centers so we can slut around even more pay up please and dont you dare being a misogynist you already are really the only way to survive in a gynocentric society is to minimize all contact with women
PurplePillDebate,removed,if by hold women accountable you mean calling women out on their bullshit identifying the bad behavior of women stating real reasons for sexual failure restrain the sexual behavior of women then youre correct because no one wants to point out that women have any responsibility for the problems in the smp and no one wants to do what it would take to hold women accountable no one wants to judge women for slutty behavior because then theyre called sexist and misogynist but that might be changing since most men are called these things and denied sex no matter what they do so what have they got to lose
PurplePillDebate,removed,bp cares about feefees not reality
PurplePillDebate,removed,then get off my thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think you should be the one taking a medicine its not cool poking fun at male suicide rates not cool i mean i get that youre a manhating feminist and male suicide rates increasing is a wonderful thing to you but as such it is my obligation to make you feel as shitty as possible
PurplePillDebate,removed,you can find stupid studies that support your stupid point but that doesnt make your stupid point correct using okc as a source is fucking stupid because theyre wrong
PurplePillDebate,removed,you and usipssparklingwater are calling me autistic what in the actual fuck dipshit you were the one who said this to me dont get spergy about this not the other way around their data is wrong just like the data proving vaccines cause autism is wrong are you just not very bright dont understand how that point went completely over your head

PurplePillDebate,removed,cmon youve been through the ringer harsh judgement is a mans world its only the strong independant gender thats now aware what that entails hahahahahahahahahaha funniest thing i read all month
PurplePillDebate,removed,every sexual encounter involves some level of convincing the other person normal people dont just walk up and start groping each others genitals in an extremely huge portion of sexual encounters the womans not sure at first mentions that shes unsureunwilling but as the night goes on she warms up to the idea the man tries to initiate again and sex happens in the blue pill universe if a woman is ever unsureunwilling at all period in any way however slightly youre supposed to bail immediately and leave the state even your continued presence talking to her could make her uncomfortable and feel like coercion the mere fact that you didnt leave and put as many miles between yourself and the woman as possible was a threat she probably thought you were going to harm her if she didnt pretend to change her mind and let you rape her
PurplePillDebate,removed,me being wrong about an aspect doesnt mean rp is unclear about it i was wrong and unclear about it trp is crystal clear and unequivocal
PurplePillDebate,removed,civilisation includes non western civilisations are you going to tell me they are domesticating men in saudi arabia mali nigeria the congo pakistan russia the ukraine lebanon

PurplePillDebate,removed,stick your guesses up your ass bitch
PurplePillDebate,removed,not a universal truth and well studied use google before picking a fight
PurplePillDebate,removed,defensive i am covertly calling you slightly dim here is some discussion on the breast size tldr poor and hungry men prefer large breast rich men prefer small breasts dominant men prefer small breasts the results of study indicate that hungry men rated a significantly larger female breast size as physically attractive than did satiated men although the effect size of this difference was smalltomoderate it nevertheless suggests that there are significant differences in the attractiveness ratings based on breast size between hungry and satiated men in addition the results of this study corroborate previous work showing that hungry men rate a significantly heavier female body size as attractive – moreover these results are in line with the findings of study in both studies it appears to be the case that men who experience relative resource insecurity show a preference for a larger breast size than do men who experience resource security
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah because youre delusional i think we already estabilished that
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes please do not listen to him he is literally hitler wont someone please think of the children everyone should panic now if you are not panicking you are literally hitler too and you hate motherhood apple pie and the children think of the children why arent you panicking yet i am not a doctor of psychology or a licensed therapist but i work in psychology and id love to inflate that into a moment of high drama with me battling the forces of evil that would be much cooler than people spitballing ideas in a set of consequence free internet conversations i was born too late to explore the world and too soon to explore the solar system so i need my drama somehow can we please inflate purple pill debate into the apocalypse for me
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice straw man you got there buddy

PurplePillDebate,removed,your view cant be changed it is right and it is based on the correct premises should we try some sophistry high ncount men have a higher probability of cheating the effect of cheating on men and woman are different based on gender but theyll vary so wildly between individuals that generalizing on gender is pretty pointless
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean its your problem not theres if thats the case not making a woman cum is pretty blue pill of you

PurplePillDebate,removed,this thread is posted almost monthly by the same person i looked through a few months of their submission history and couldnt find much similar what are you referring to who admits theyre not even here to discuss at all but shit post just to get responses from people and look down on them thats a stretch considering how that comment was a response to a flippant who cares and how he had a reasonable point and a mod did tell him to make higherquality posts next time so it was addressed but uskratt is whats got you bothered unlike op whos written a couple of paragraphs in straightforward language to describe his ideas uskratt is shitposting oneliners with an intentionally grating tone that the former is a reasonable poster expressing ideas you might disagree with the latter is a troll adopting a character for the express purpose of trying to get under peoples skins
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats my baby get em girl
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not hyperbole isis nazis feminists have something in common theyre ideologies held by minorities that are still effective in changing the world negatively if youre imaging feminists wearing burkas and swaztikas at the same time thats youre fault for taking things too literally like a typical sperglord or more likely youre just being obtuse because you know that youre full of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre not even engaging with what i said i said godwins law is lame if hitler were resurrected youd say the same thing because youre brain dead and can only speak in memes lay off the acid you arent even close to hunter s or robert anton wilson
PurplePillDebate,removed,only low smv guys feel hypergamy pressure from women average and high smv guys dont feel that pressure raise your smv and the reality of female hypergamy goes away

PurplePillDebate,removed,historically speaking the only way a woman could improve her lot in life was to marry up say aitch use the correct fork and practice her company manners its multiple generations of convention and survival technique to get your head around its also nothing like what trp calls hypergamy
PurplePillDebate,removed,but the preferences of men are more diveeerse theyll be fine fucking either of their favourite pornstars while stacy will only settle for brad pitt s

PurplePillDebate,removed,women validate other women beta men validate women this is kind of backed up by some studies but if you ever get a bit of a brain you would have noticed that group dynamic already as a consequence stuff about women is over mediated while stuff about men arent or as pissed on by the majority of the population
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats life in the big city gee willikers aint racial diversity great
PurplePillDebate,removed,is your reading comprehension so poor that you cant realise that i was talking about the generalisations to mra mgtow and traditional conservatives how about you allow them to speak for themselves instead of butting into a conversation trying to stick up for them like some white knight
PurplePillDebate,removed,the dogma that often gets passed around that all women are like that is one of the reasons i take the red pill with a grain of salt it makes it a lot harder to believe other aspects of the sub when something so stupid continues to be said by so many
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am not whiteknighting yes yes you are trad coms do want sahm that is part of being trad com no it can be part of being a traditional conservative i notice you have left out mras which i specifically mentioned due to the fact you have no polar argument to use for that one in your little world of either black or white you must struggle understanding anything other than checkers

PurplePillDebate,removed,so go reprogram human females to like that in a lab not every woman lashes out at any hint of vulnerability the way you do
PurplePillDebate,removed,then again you only see emotional vulnerability as a form of manipulation and you admit any other use confuses you
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh you gave the least amount of shits by the rules of the manosphere thats an instant win for you im beginning to see why they wanted feminism to do all their work for them
PurplePillDebate,removed,altis life
PurplePillDebate,removed,cant really change your view rp may make the case about baby rabies or the wall or other stuff but its all kind of bullshit if youre just an average guy women tend to hold all the cards its only when the guy in question is so high value he has multiple options that things can change

PurplePillDebate,removed,i really dislike effeminite men taking my word faggot is mine and i aint giving it up to faggots like this
PurplePillDebate,removed,the ones that have that sort of problem generally suffer from gender myopia i remember a few trying to get me interested by talking up how great a job they had how much the made or in a couple of cases how nice their house was there are also a bunch of them on tinder posing in front a their new car or with the same travel pics as if that is going to make a guy interested the other part is expectations the higher a woman rises in the business world the higher her expectations rise but her attractiveness does not rise to match so that creates a dead zone
PurplePillDebate,removed,coward

PurplePillDebate,removed,roflmao are you upset hubby sends you to buy presents for his mom my wife does that with a smile she enjoys giving gifts and i hate it she does it for me gladly because she loves me and shes happy to do something she enjoys that also takes some stress off my shoulders and to be sure gift giving is entirely stressful for me at any rate if your man cant balance a checkbook follow a shopping list and use a cellphone to see what jr is up to maybe you didnt get a high quality man or maybe you dont inspire him to care enough to do it for you hard to say
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know a lot of attractive to women attractive for their age who are either divorced miserably unhappy in their marriages or have had to endure severe stress and dysfunction in their marriages assuming theyre still married a lot of them are on the way to divorce it doesnt work well for them they will never ever admit it publicly but what is going on with them is their seething disappointment anger and resentment at being unable to lock down one of the very attractive men they used to fuck if they could have done so they would have they couldnt so they married less attractive betas they were kinda sorta attracted to but not nearly as much as they were to the men they used to fuck there is some attraction there its just not enough to last years or more its just not enough to get them through the tough times so how is it going to make women happy to marry betas when theyre all secretly creaming their pants for men that they are actually attracted to or should i just attribute this thread and the previous comment to your generally bitter state
PurplePillDebate,removed,according to you all women want alphas those are your words not mine so how are future relationships with men who they dont want going to work out regardless of whether they ride the cc this thread completely contradicts what you said about hours ago also im not attacking you youre yearsold i believe and if you maintain your current mindset for the rest of your life then whatever years you have left will be unhappy that is guaranteed someone needs to spell this out to you although i have no doubt that you will pay absolutely no attention
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow you really hate casual sex women
PurplePillDebate,removed,how many replies before you bring up lesbians and gay men im asking because your replies are generally worthless and id like to skip the preamble for once and just get it over with
PurplePillDebate,removed,and youre red pillokay lets ask someone who isnt bitter basically youre upset you are an average dude and women want better than that if i was your gf and you were this lame id go fuck a better guy too wouldnt you
PurplePillDebate,removed,ah hes just like my dads age except even more bitter i can see why he had all this free time must be a lonely retiree
PurplePillDebate,removed,basically youre upset nobody wants you now that youre old and undesireable
PurplePillDebate,removed,i would suggest that your inability to form a lasting relationship has made you bitter and frustrated your claiming you arent bitter doesnt mean you arent bitter your inability to see facts for what they are instead of what youd like them to be leads to your ridiculous beliefs so again you really should come down off that high horse and dont hurt yourself while doing so youre no better than i am so stop acting as if you are being a brit impacts your experience because of the differences in the smps between the us and the uk i dont know why you cant see your own bitterness and frustration as for the rest of your post ive already addressed it elsewhere im out on this little subthread as youre not raising anything that hasnt already been addressed and this is now degenerating into ad hominems that add nothing to the discussion and illuminate none of the issues
PurplePillDebate,removed,its fine he is just bitter and old he can spout misogyny all he wants but since its trp thought its normal
PurplePillDebate,removed,triggered
PurplePillDebate,removed,the dude just comes here to troll you shouldnt take him too seriously

PurplePillDebate,removed,i gotta say uskinnysweaty your never ending passion for getting rage boners on ppd just adds to the subs popcorn value i can almost hear the sound of you furiously clacking away at your keyboard anytime i read your posts
PurplePillDebate,removed,from most mens perspective as hurtful as it might be to an old lady
PurplePillDebate,removed,these people are fucking retarded
PurplePillDebate,removed,that guy just comes here to brag about banging lots of girls and putting down every other man dont take him seriously lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,calling people out on bs and hypocrisy is lashing out righto cupcake ill remember that when and if the posting ban is up there will be hugs and reach arounds for all in trp i bring up the ban when im accused of being a terper the mod in your little hug box couldnt deal with being brought to bare has he recovered yet or still in therapy
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol if they did you wouldnt be whining every time you open your mouth xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,every post he makes is messy and passive aggressive xd he never has anything good to say
PurplePillDebate,removed,then why are you so negative you should be busy drowning in p xd youd think someone living that lifestyle would be less salty
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol im not about to go thru your history but youre always saying something nastyuntrue about women ill point it out next time you do it
PurplePillDebate,removed,new account for trolling yes trp is actually more balanced about criticizing men than mainstream is about criticizing women i see a lot of them criticizing both and everything in fact both bp and rp rip on unattractive men a lot which is a bit unfair how is that unfair its totally fair
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have reported your post for offensive content hopefully you will be able to learn your lesson and be a bit more civil in the future
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have reported your post for offensive content hopefully you will be able to learn your lesson and be a bit more civil in the future
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have reported your post for offensive content hopefully you will be able to learn your lesson and be a bit more civil in the future
PurplePillDebate,removed,they arent liberal they are socialist a lot of socialists are individualists tend to be the ones that dont know what the hell they are talking about like you
PurplePillDebate,removed,disgusting no wonder morals are going down the toilet
PurplePillDebate,removed,who the fuck are you to tell me what is trolling you fucking worthless cunt huh you fucking piece of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,scratch that you have no clue and no empathy feministlol
PurplePillDebate,removed,bbut im not a racist narpalt
PurplePillDebate,removed,someone that systematically categorizes everything and sees the sexes as a hierarchy with men representing everything good about humanity and women as those annoying sex things that you have to put up with is also more likely to place races in a hierarchy where they just randomly happen to be on top due to any arbitrary reasons they can come up with arent all humans just those annoying things that you have to put up with more seriously trp is not supposedly judging anything as good or bad only society does that
PurplePillDebate,removed,so as we all know trpers tend to be more racist than average people because someone that systematically categorizes everything and sees the sexes as a hierarchy with men representing everything good about humanity and women as those annoying sex things that you have to put up with is also more likely to place races in a hierarchy where they just randomly happen to be on top due to any arbitrary reasons they can come up with as usual your explanations for certain phenomena simultaneously betray your selfrighteousness as well as your shortcomings when it comes to analytical thinking doesnt reflect well on you
PurplePillDebate,removed,see how most comments focus on the racist thing it leads to a shit discussion no racially charged content allowed
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill tell who i like and i will report who i like especially an obvious red pill recruiting user such as herself
PurplePillDebate,removed,lololol 😂 im sorry this made me laugh so hard perfume you mean cologne sorry for laughing i cant wait to read the answers especially as i have seen so many guys out in bars and clubs and ive wondered what the hell is he wearing
PurplePillDebate,removed,white people are called racist anytime they discuss anything relating to black people triggered
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant emulate it because its mostly genetic also as stated in danger adventure excitement strength life isnt dangerous adventurous or exciting so you cant really recreate that in everyday life if women actually experienced the things that are depicted in movies they wouldnt be excited they would be scared thats why rpers constantly carp on about lifting but even your ability to appear strong is largely dependent on genetics and its also an illusion of the visual media even the people who play those parts arent like that in real life were all completely coddled by modern society
PurplePillDebate,removed,no silly all genes come from the man the woman is merely a vessel
PurplePillDebate,removed,i thought that only white people can be rp as trp is a hateful ideology and only white people being carrier of the original sin of privilege can be oppressive towards women but then again the op believes theres a moderate form of sharia somewhere that can promote respect for women so i guess that explains his unusual views
PurplePillDebate,removed,but im not a feministlol sorry i didnt consider the possibility that not every snarky smug cunt with a superiority complex is a feminist fuck you fucking bitch
PurplePillDebate,removed,muh rape tho muh raaaaaaape culture
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive been with my partner years would not dream of leaving him for someone else unless he drastically changed in which case hes not really the man i loved anymore the hamster in action you just showed how easy it is for women to rationalize being disloyal you also contradicted yourself in two sentences fun times
PurplePillDebate,removed,have we adopted mens expectation without the the biology to support it dude yes man i have so many thoughts on this will attempt not to splat them all here first of all i agree that theres a general cultural message of sex should be fucking awesome you should come every time at least once preferably multiple times i think i get where this comes from and i also think i get that it came at least at first from a good place from women who didnt want other women to just think that sex was just another choreduty like doing the dishes or washing his socks who wanted other women to experience how completely fucking awesome it can be but and ive sort of thought this for awhile now i think it masculinizes the female sex drive in some ways in my experience women talking to friends so nawalt and myself specifically i am much less linear about sex than the men ive known are men get a boner and that boner is pointed towards one thing orgasm mens sex drive feels aimed mine does not feel that way mine feels diffuse i can get as much out of sex if i dont have an orgasm as i do if i do not all the time but sometimes im old enough now that im perfectly ok with just enjoying it in my own way but when i was a teenager i totally bought all that shit it used to cause me a lot of stress to have sex and not an orgasm like something was wrong with me somehow even if i liked it there was still that but all the shitty magazines and websites say you should be getting off and that getting off should be the peak goalexperience and if youre not then something is wrong and you need to fix it in the back of my mind fuck that if i had a teenage daughter i think i would ban her from all womens media and all of this said as highsexdrivehightgaymaninawomansbody type sex is very very rarely a chore for me so im only speaking for myself and not for women who often find it tedious etc as for men would they have it easier if we didnt expect to be given multiple orgasms by a ons yeah probably but i dont know if i want to give men the idea that skill doesnt matter because it does for straight men anyway and simply because women are more difficult to satisfy than men in general
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why i dont generally post on reddit especially ppd unless its worthwhile or im being cheeky secondly in addition to having no life and being a neckbeard i am also hardcore mgtow mens rights and a manchild cant cuck someone whose already cucked
PurplePillDebate,removed,while anecdotal theyre common enough that ive had a friend accused of it purely because the woman didnt want her boyfriend to leave her
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists blocked it im shocked shocked i tell you
PurplePillDebate,removed,compare the falsely accused figures in the bottom right to the rapist ones on the top left theyre like half the size if you still want to claim thats a formatting error youre clearly just making excuses
PurplePillDebate,removed,i didnt discover good sex until i was on partner number seems like the common denominator for the first was you
PurplePillDebate,removed,so in other words you have no problem believing that only of all rape accusations are fabricated plus an dark figure thats ten times as high well as i said feminism the radical notion that women are better people
PurplePillDebate,removed,httpsiimgurcomqvitxhjpng i genuinely agree with you
PurplePillDebate,removed,dem goalposts wheeeee
PurplePillDebate,removed,trolling for the win again go get some life experience
PurplePillDebate,removed,all of them dear just be honest and admit you fucked up
PurplePillDebate,removed,shut up you dumb bitch what makes you think anybody cares about your memories from flyover state u
PurplePillDebate,removed,no personal attacks
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh my god you mad suffragettes you going against the patriarchy of trp i just cant even my day is made hell my year is made i cant believe you guys woke up squeezy hugs for all of you may you continue to grow and see the light
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah i know that slutshaming has a bad rep because of all the crazies out there the crazies are the most vocal you are a crazy
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is the boldest playing dumb ive seen on this subreddit well done
PurplePillDebate,removed,the man is to blame first becuase supposedly the judge is just following the law which is his purpose in life second because blackmailing the court with threats of suicide should in no way be taken into consideration if we started to alter court ruling because people threatened to commit suicide we might as well abolish the courts thirdly because committing suicide over such a thing is just plain stupid theres a host of options any man can take and if all else fails get the fuck out of there go to brazil or vietnam or whatever live on the beach and fuck cute brown girls
PurplePillDebate,removed,i suppose you should make sure youre being really careful about contraception then
PurplePillDebate,removed,id be less worried about the financial support than about the fact the poor tyke might have inherited from his sperm donor a bunch of genes for idiocy weakness and histrionic behavior i guess the woman is the one to blame for fucking a loser in the first place
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is bullshit the judge is not responsible for causing this man to commit suicide if the man didnt want to pay child support he should have went to the drug store and invested twelve bucks in some rubbers
PurplePillDebate,removed,and theres little societal pushback against women throwing men under the bus because men are disposable women can make the most serious of false accusations perjure themselves to make sure the guy goes to jail have him rot in a hole for years and then face no punishment when her lie gets discovered down the road see the brian banks case its a broken system if something or someone carried just a chance to ruin your life wouldnt you be cautious around that
PurplePillDebate,removed,humans are out to protect themselves which sometimes puts innocent people in the crossfire so youre an advocate of driveby shootings
PurplePillDebate,removed,its certainly not an excuse to avoid paying child support if it does in fact happen though after all reasonable foreseeability is absolutely irrelevant when it comes to child support
PurplePillDebate,removed,what child support insurance this isnt a thing that ive heard of what insurance company would ever offer that
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is blame
PurplePillDebate,removed,i get what you mean man honestly its unfair when the system takes you for a ride a woman can take your sperm impregnate herself then sue you for child support but heres the thing no one should be responsible for your actions ideally shed have to raise the kid on her own because she misled you but committing suicide is on no one elses head except yours really child support and child custody are hot topics in the manosphere because of the misery it causes men and of course few women care usually they only care when a portion of hubbys money is going to a kid he never wanted instead of to her or her kids its like when i read an article about a mom who stopped being a feminist only because her son was falsely accused of rape on campus and then expelled its only when theyre affected that theyre interested in equality so what do you do you fight you pay your child support but you fight thats what men do thats what we used to do anyway sure we all die one day but we try not to do so while giving up we know the world is unfair we know things are messed up there are many men who have survived having everything taken from them theres a reason they call it divorce rape there was one episode of married not the greatest show but whatevs where they were trying to convince a divorced guy to look for something real because he was struggling to get over his ex he was also taking drugs partying and hooking up with random women he responded with something like i had real real left me and took half my shit the world doesnt always get what a raw deal it gives men but heres the thing if men just give up then everybody loses they dont have to comply thats why theyre going their own way they dont have to work for anyone else but themselves but taking yourself out of the game helps no one not you not the kid not the other men whove been through it or are going through it the second you end it no one else is to blame but you
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe im just enough of an alpha that i can handle strong independent women shaming language if you disagree you must be insecure
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe im just enough of an alpha that i can handle strong independent women get smacked with a false assault accusation from a woman or get shit on by white knights when you defend yourself from a woman attacking you and we will see how much of an alpha you really are
PurplePillDebate,removed,qft if i had a gold to give you i would but i dont so take my upvote instead
PurplePillDebate,removed,please bloopies say this is a strawman that never happens and make my day

PurplePillDebate,removed,finally a reasonable statement in this thread from an rper
PurplePillDebate,removed,aw come on atlas dont stifle the boys conversation about penises just cause you dont have one and have nothing to contribute penis envy is so last century get with the times darling
PurplePillDebate,removed,opinion is not reality then do you have a source to back up uxorchids claim or are you just touting tautologies because you have nothing of substance to actually add to the conversation
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh yes add the womens prerogative to change her mind never mind the lead times required to get shit put in place i mean putting up with this shit madness covered that with my girls mad at me
PurplePillDebate,removed,just a personal opinion odd since opinions arent reality according to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,so like i said youre just touting tautologies because you have nothing of substance to add got it noted and tagged
PurplePillDebate,removed,its really not too difficult to figure out men or at least mens wants its usually along the lines of be hot offer lots of sex dont bitchnag all the time give him some alone time or time to hang out with his friends and dont cheat thank you that is exactly what i was thinking of be uncomplicated like that and you are fine dont be like that and you become complicated and annoying
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you make an articulate argument on whether youre agreeing or disagreeing with me instead of just being a smart ass like you do all the time in this forum
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you dont bother me enough to make me want to block you i get a kick out of interacting with the likes of you bullies who come here under the guise of having some pseudointellectual discussion when really all theyre doing is making fun of those who they feel are beneath them you hold such an animosity towards rp incels and the others who cluster around these discussions that you humor yourself by engaging with them for your own amusements that have nothing to do with real debatediscussion or trying to help some for these dudes better themselves in other words i know youre just a lame troll but it doesnt bother me enough to block you because i like calling you out on your bullshit for others to see so that they know that theyre dealing with someone who probably shouldnt be taken too seriously
PurplePillDebate,removed,omfg you talked to me rape oh someone please save me someone is talking to me this is literally assault ahhhh must retreat to my safe space
PurplePillDebate,removed,modern smp banging a pool boy or hot biker do trps ever go outside or do they just write field reports shes not yours its just your turn makes sense i guess but you could also say hes not yours its just your turn until he leaves you and bangs an year old starbucks barista thats not addressing the post with an argument of your own thats just you being a smartass trying to be clever with some bs response aka a troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,theres no way youre not autistic
PurplePillDebate,removed,idk start with carpet bombing from san fransisco to new york maybe these are symptomatic of much deeper issues surrounding human nature our culture other than some drastic action its probably only going to get worse
PurplePillDebate,removed,the preeminent manosphere guys roosh bill price paul elam all imploded the red pill subreddit has lots of internal bickering and drama who are they supposed to be looking up to exactly i think you should rephrase your question and see who it is these guys are supposed to be following in the first place seems like a inmates running the asylum kinda deal
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree but would add neither does feminism or the sjw movement getting role models from extremist ideologies probably isnt the best way to go about it
PurplePillDebate,removed,dunno if youve been around long but qw is our resident crazy she is not a good example of most or even the average woman spend any amount of time on ppd or go through her history and confirm but she doesnt get a lot of attention or agreement even from women because shes firmly established a reputation as batshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,people have smart phones out of necessity now especially if they cant afford computers or even a home phone or modem you want a job an active social circle stay in touch with your family keep up with the news do literally anything on the internet then if youre low income your only option is a smartphone i would question why you want low income people to have visibly less than you would that make you feel better about yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre beating a dead horse here dragoness already won
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are you so bitter
PurplePillDebate,removed,or they act like rquestioningwomen talks
PurplePillDebate,removed,idk why they dont understand this xd cant get laid get in the gym no excuses no sympathy unless youre disabled
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont be retarded prove why it matters in this respect or concede you have no leg to stand on no one said men and women are different is false just prove why and to what it extent it makes a difference for the argument you are making
PurplePillDebate,removed,most women willingly take hundreds of cocks every week we need to recognize that having just one of these cocks enter her without her so called consent isnt really that big a deal and it isnt even as traumatic as what a guy whos accused of rape has to go through legalizing rape is really the only fair and just course of action
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant relate to feminism because the ones screaming for it are asking for all the privileges without any of the responsibilities nobody is stopping women from going into stem fields andor becoming neurosurgeons the fact of the matter is they choose not to they choose to live an easy comfortable life unlike men their value isnt extremely tied to their profession most of the women around me live their lives just existing pointlessly wasting oxygen they spend half their life getting drunk at clubs and the rest swiping on tinder or looking up mermaids on pinterest but then we have people like emma watson why would i listen to a girl whose biggest accomplishment was to play a makebelieve witch on screen if bill gates said something i would be all ears i am not against equal rights or anything of that sort i am not advocating we remove voting rights or right to own property or shit like that but we are already living in a gynocentric society fuelled by the feminine imperative what more do they want
PurplePillDebate,removed,alpha males are rare and do not play well with others they are great to have in times of conflict but in times of extended peace women prize more beta traits in guys but mainly because there just arent that many true alphas around
PurplePillDebate,removed,women do not deserve these resources ms feminazi they should not receive them for free if they are so concerned about raising their kids they shouldnt whore themselves out to chad and hope for beta bill and the taxpayers to pick up the tab
PurplePillDebate,removed,how did mattress girl work out for you guys as a mascot lol didnt she make a shitty porn err i mean piece of artistic expression about taking it up the butt so inspirational
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminist woman socialist it all checks out
PurplePillDebate,removed,this concept that feminists claim men and women are the same is a myth the truth is most people do not understand what they mean when they say that the idea of men and women being different has been twisted and bent by men for centuries to enforce rigid gender roles and keep women down some examples men and women are different women lean more towards social intelligence men towards problem solving this is true how has the patriarchy twisted this by saying women are incapable of reason are over emotional chatty and should not be allowed within university premises men and women are different women have a maternal instinct true how has the patriarchy twisted this to an extreme by claiming women must not work because their role is to care for children and that they should not have abortions because it is traumatic for their delicate wee feelings because women have no ambition of course and only care about children what feminists mean when they say differences are not that big is that women are actual human beings with ambition and personal will just like men even if their outlook of the world is different it is a rejection of the caricaturish image of women men have created for centuries to hold them back and force them into a secondary role
PurplePillDebate,removed,thanks op great point yes there are average differences between men and women and feminism recognizes that what i would add is that where feminists tend to disagree is in the idea that psychological gender differences are due to socialization or genetics now heres the drill even if the differences are genetic psychological gender differences are on average small arround correlations and this is based on evolutionary psychology studies most trpers dont actually read evolutionary psychology studies let alone those who actually interpret them correctly so they tend to overstate gender differences because evolution hardwired females that way but thats not what evolutionary psychology says most gender differences the way trp put it is a complete fad women are not uncontrollably emotional and men are not much more rational than women dont believe me search for yourself and stop quoting evolutionary psychology wrongly
PurplePillDebate,removed,wrong try again i dont even think most women are satisfied but you think the sex with less power in the market is more satisfied yeah youre not that bright

PurplePillDebate,removed,if i dont have sex with a guy i can maintain intimacy seemingly indefinitely soa beta orbiter is my lizard brain telling me its time to find a new mate and im just tricking myself into thinking its something more like branch swinging rpw has given some advice on this but they seem to think that this only happens to naggy bitchy wives who stop having sex with their husband see your earlier feelings about stage and insert rpw adviceif you could be so introspective on how youve attributed to stage yet the intimacy is still gone boyfriend failed now will become a utility of comfort besides convenience right comfort unfortunately i have no better theories than rp offers the hamster is strong with this one as i said earlier rpw works for those women that can identify where theyve screwed up you arent doing that you are rationalizing an inevitable breakup in the near future ah there i go reading your mind which i cant
PurplePillDebate,removed,how do you not understand the difference between hair growing faster and hair kept longer by preference im trying to find a way to express my opinion of your comment without running afoul of the no personal attacks rule but i cant i just cant ill have to leave you to imagine the cruel invective i would hurl at you imagine the worst insults to your intelligence i could say and thats what im saying to you now maybe google whats the most emphatic way you can say someone is stupid and the top five results are what im trying to say hereof the five smartest people ive encountered today you are the sixth

PurplePillDebate,removed,fa −fb
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have not i also think its a rare combination i predict the girls are going to gloss over the elephant in the room them using this guy and the guy becoming upset at being used women know damn well if a guy is hanging around them a bunch the guy is trying to fuck and when i say they know i mean it they know but the women will say well not every guy is trying to get into my pants some guys are just cool to chill like that bullshit we all know it besides if there was any confusion the of guys that possibly maybe dont want to fuck she could always ask him or put the issue out there in stark terms leaving no uncertainty or ambiguity a woman wont do this however because then the jig would be up surprise turns out that iswhat the guy wanted now he knows hes not getting any so he bounces now she has to find a new guy to do her favors so women have become expert at ambiguity particularly in leading men on theyll pretend they dont know a guy wants to fuck them so they can extract time attention and other favors from that guy theyll do their best to avoid the conversation to keep the gravy train going when the guy realizes hes being used and she doesnt care to sleep with him he decides to not be friends any longer since he cant fuck her and she invokes the proverbial nice guy who
PurplePillDebate,removed,you heard it guys stop lifting weights stop making your purpose more important than your woman go back to being spineless wimps and put em all back on the pedestal

PurplePillDebate,removed,i always found it funny redpillers have hard ons for words such as truths rational reality etc etc you could always suck on those hard ons until they go away they dont seem to understand these words are so popular because they have emotional appeal to them that they feel like theyre on the right side or they do understand and thats why they use them lol its a very common and rather lazy tactic in political groups you can see it all the time on conspiracy boards or on political pundits ie the truth is immigrants are ruining america its nothing more than an emotional appeal illegal immigrants since the current administration released criminal aliens who committed crimes including rape murder thats just the ones that werent deported so yknow facts are facts the fact that you have some weird emotional need to defend mexican rapists doesnt magically mend the pussies of the women they raped lol saying things like red pill truths state all women are hypergamous children is an opinion that you and your like minded peers decided to share people use these words all the time to make their sweeping generalizations sound more legit the reality is that women are incapable of loving you kind of like how you just generalized me and my like minded peers lol and all these self proclaimed rational and truth seeking redpillers gobble this up because they agree with it and fits into their worldview at this very moment you can go to rforeverunwanted or on to read autistic virgins talk about the truth about women too its funny you rail against people gobbling up shit that appeals to their worldview and yet you take the anonymous often ironic exaggerated troll posts at as reality because you hate weak men so much you cant help taking the autistic virgin bait fyi im not here to debate rp ideas just the abuse of the word truth well you could start by not stating your own opinions as fact lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,no she presents her opinions about trp as opinions you are pretty ridiculous thats an opinion but you are free to take it as a fact if you like
PurplePillDebate,removed,pretty sure rp hates shit tests
PurplePillDebate,removed,envy
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminism is predicated on women especially white women being constantly oppressed in every way a victim needs an abuser so who is easiest to blame
PurplePillDebate,removed,opinions can be true such as the opinion that women are stupid

PurplePillDebate,removed,not rp but this preference boils down to family economics in cultures where women have historically been considered property wives leave their own families to become a part of their husbands families by having a son you are essentially gaining a son and a daughter whereas having a daughter is a net loss of course this got all messed up with the widespread availability of abortion since now there are quite a few asian cultures where boys vastly outnumber girls in india the ratio is girls for every boys a demographic to me on bed and many of those sons will never find the wives their families are anticipating

PurplePillDebate,removed,in my experience the main reason women get pumped and dumped is due to lack of personality i am guilty of having pumped and dumped a few girls but my intentions never started that way with every single one of them i was genuinely interested in them at the beginning and was trying for an ltr but then sooner or later i would realize this girl is kind of vapid and since i was already half way there i would see things through until i fucked her once or with one of them a few times before moving on
PurplePillDebate,removed,i just went to a generic school i think fairly or not of womens studies as being a luxury degree for the upper classes
PurplePillDebate,removed,i included how could this be accomplished with minimal mgtow complaining to prevent mindless preprogrammed circle jerking i guess asking for solutions is too hard when people are more concerned with perpetuating women are wonderful effect and putting other people down to feel better about their own insecurities
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont recommend red pill because red pill reveals the truth that all women who arent the monster of lock ness want chads and will cheat on their boyfriends if the opportunity to get a bigger better deal and because trp doesnt treat women like princesses and instead knows how women truly are colour me surprised
PurplePillDebate,removed,make up and twist it as you please i guess

PurplePillDebate,removed,to me every argument deemed valid rhetorically can be reduced to a veiled ad hominen consider the conflation of ugliness with immorality this is written off as a discarded medieval notion but seems applicable to contemporary times dont be a creep considered the ways this subreddit has changed meim puzzled by how this forum is generally composed only of text if posters were required to post images of themselves alongside their statements i wonder how that would alter the way that information was taken no longer completely detached from the body that composed it i would like to link to images of myself i wonder if my degree of unattractiveness forces the reader to lose interest in my writing httpmimgurcomaqdnbt it would be interesting if everyone posted images of themselves the beautiful bodies of the people on this forum i think many people read rp content and realize the limits of maintaining a cerebral morality because of this efforts lack of offering direct advantages in improving their sexual lives however i suspect we never really move on and engagedimmerse ourselves in the shallow physical world instead just perpetually mourning the death of our previous idealism
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont know shit about me nor my life i dont care how you justify your mistreatment of me and no youre a monster far as im concerned tell me wouldnt you murder an incel for fun not even me in particular just any incel tell me youd knock them to the ground and put a bullet in their heads just to watch them die because to you theyre lower than shit and how the fuck am i entitled youre the one thats fucking entitled just because i dont want to be alone doesnt make me entitled and narcissistic victim complex and the only time hahahahahahahahaha wanna know how i wound up messed up bitch all my life ive been put down and bullied and alienated by pieces of shit like you youve always pushed me into the dirt called me a freak a weirdo an oreo point and laugh at me even spit on me and for what wanna know how long my life has been like this since i was fucking the same time when my parents were consonantly fighting you think serving makes you entitled to my hero worship i tried to serve but was denied my only chance to be in the military is a third world war and the guy that killed all those cops was a vet bet youll ignore that though and since youre a woman i doubt you did any combat work im sorry your family was shitty but once you were an adult you could leave me ive been alienated and abandoned my entire life you think people are born fucked up and hating themselves and the world around them if you believe that then you are truly fucking stupid youre why i hate normies with a passion oh and as for considering harming yourself once i thought of killing myself almost every single day from the time i was until this year when i was put in a psyche ward and given meds and i consider it whenever i run out of meds youre not better than me youre just another bully youre why i hate normies with a passion

PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists are mostly people with various personality disorders and its hard to find anything rational in what they say and believe bluepillers might as well be in the same spectrum of mental disorders as they seem to be overly concerned with trp despite at the same time claiming redpillers are just a numerically insignificant fringe group
PurplePillDebate,removed,no way bpers at best would rather incels a quiet down and accept their fate or b quiet down and rebel against it either way they must quiet down bpers love to mock sneer insult and shame anyone who possess bad beliefs or ideologies because they believe that to be easily changeable they dont care much for the why behind it they dont care for blanket statements about groups of people you need to just get it and get along with everybody since not all incels possess a strong bitterness and resentment to the opposite sex bpers do not care for them remember bpers prize individualism and uniqueness above all sweeping generalizations and prejudicial assumptions they operate on a people are generally good and moral premise and they really dislike those who appear to be spreading hatred against hardcoded traits like race gender and genetics as opposed to softcoded ones like ideology beliefs and perspectives try going on rp and being an incel and when you get the unsolicited advice make excuses or cry more that tough love stance very quickly just becomes tough if not brutal if you want your nature analogy of being weeded from the herd you need to focus on those who actually believe in alphabetaomega hierarchical models and who regularly employ naturalistic metaphors bpers want hate to die not the hater rpers want losers to die not the winners youre looking in the wrong direction
PurplePillDebate,removed,newsflash everyone hates weak men
PurplePillDebate,removed,its obvious if you accept trp but of course we have to sustain the agenda
PurplePillDebate,removed,tom youre crazy
PurplePillDebate,removed,the freedom of a poor person getting food stamps hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha what the fuck lololol
PurplePillDebate,removed,that is one of the biggest fallacies that rp spews you want a participation trophy go back to kindergarten the rest of the world knows there is a big difference between real men and everyone else
PurplePillDebate,removed,so what if i say your playing really compliments how great your boobs look
PurplePillDebate,removed,i could say i let my own anecdotal evidence personally guide me that attractive chicks do in fact like more muscle but you guys would just dismiss that anyway instead ill do something just as productive and point out that you have on one end of the spectrum fucking jay cutler as an example and then some fucking skinny bitch as the other you literally left the entire spectrum of muscle development and size wide the fuck open there is literally a pound difference between those two shitpost so either you are some beta male who wants validation that his skinny arms are indeed what women want or you are an unattractive woman who is mad that cant get the dude with big biceps to look at her and wants to hear an echo chamber of ewww thats too big for me pick one
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre just a special little outlier arent you
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists dont even believe themselves most the shit they say thats why they are constantly contradicting themselves male sexuality is not something they want to understand its just something theyll make claims about to get what they want
PurplePillDebate,removed,no ones angry i just disagree
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont enjoy debate ppd isnt really about well reasoned debate eat shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,just ban me man it doesnt matter my life will be better without this forum i am curious though did you delete his reply to my eat shit comment or did he his reply was fucking amazing and i wish i could reply eat shit to it again the level of idiocy he put on display is breathtaking a decent person would have admitted that their contradiction was retarded and would either a take a position or b admit they troll for fun
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck no
PurplePillDebate,removed,buuuuuuuuuuuuulshiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a liar
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre probably a lesbian anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,radfems are not worth an argument
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not nothing this was actually discussed here on ppd and women themselves agreed that i understand that it hurts your feelings when someone says you are inferior in some way just because you are a female but thats the truth i wouldnt mind it being false but i didnt choose our genes as a consolation prize you can always say that women are able to give birth to children
PurplePillDebate,removed,you would bow to him like a slave and lovingly do any sexual favor he demands ill go with actions rather than words sloots
PurplePillDebate,removed,you quit posting because you downvote people and get downvoted in return
PurplePillDebate,removed,the boys were mean to me no wonder i like bad boys i moved miles for the tingles but his influence was so bad for me after the tingles were gone no doubt
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah but what if youre a normal person and sex isnt that big of a deal to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,considering that taped sexual intercourse is the only way men can prove their innocence in a false rape claim it should not be forbidden this is the point i was making in my comment that i think spacewhiskey missed having affirmative consent without the ability to prove that it happened is a big problem
PurplePillDebate,removed,this isnt what im talking about and you know it of course i do but why would i care what youre talking about fuck women and their incessant need to make everything about them no matter how much other party is damaged in the process why not talk about men sometimes a man can chose to be falsely accused of rape get raped in prison or smashed by a whiteknight on feminist behest and i should care about some womans random feeling on her privacy isnt damage done to a man falsely accused many times greater than infringement of her privacy yes because two wrongs dont make a right often they do the equivalent of this is he might be hitting you but you cant hit him back or even protect yourself two wrongs dont make a right this advice that mr blogs are giving men to record their partners to prevent false allegations is laughable its telling them to commit a crime to avoid being falsely accused of that crime its the best that they can come up and fyi false accusation of crime is a crime and theyre not commiting a crime to avoid being falsely accused of that same crime since taping sex and rapign are two different things mra are saying commit a lesser crime so you dont get fucked by a bigger kingpin they have no other option as this is anarchotyranny bull fucking shit this is exactly what im talking about i didnt get that impression i got the impression that you thought mens cheating is rationalized and justified its not ive even explicitly said so to illustrate it men cheating is like killing gorillion jews while women cheating is like killing gorrilion jews and clowns its worse but not by much but this notion that women are allowed to hit comes from the notion that women are physically weaker than men which is a patriarchal way of thinking i disagree completely patriarchal way of thinking doesnt say weaker than you should not hit by that logic womenweaker than you does not translate to womenshould not hit in fact its often the feminist who jeer for female on male violence and justify it duluth model of vawa is feminist made also of the few women who ive actually met who at one point in their lives hit men they told me it was because their fathers told them it was okay fancy that cause of few women whove hit men almost all of them were told by their mothers hyperbole much i have never once heard or read of someone encouraging women to be as violent as they want so are you questioning my experience ive more than one time heard notion of when a man hits a woman its cause hes scum when a woman hits a man its cause hes scum unironically said by women often feminists to not regard women the same way is a double standard no because women and men are not the same how about the following double standard women have vaginas but want penises wheres the outcry for this absurd and outdated and racist premise this is beyond disingenuous and nothing in what i wrote suggests id support something like that this is not beyond disingenuous and its not even disingenuous you literally said i do not however believe that behavior that hurts women is harmlesshealthy my example is of a behaviour that hurts women but cannot be possible called unhealthy when you make a grand statement like that be ready for someone to pick it apart and put it through the most absurd but possible scenario this is common suppose that you said you should never lie but then someone asks you but what if youre lying to nazi officer who just wants to genocide some juden and then you repeat lol that never happens same thing
PurplePillDebate,removed,its neither sexy nor a turn off stop trying to relate to me im joking but its so cringe how you talk next its gonna be kondomsrkoolkids or some shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,my opinion is who cares
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh really feminists never said that only yes means yes you can defend and rationalize all you want its just strawmans and shitty arguments herp all rp are rapist and thats why they tape sex xd tbp is filled with bunch of idiots pretentiously circlejerking on how evil rp is perhaps you should go there
PurplePillDebate,removed,literally every point you made addresses a straw man but im going to take you to task partially because im in a bit of a rush right now for what are the worst in the list laws against revenge porn in the past two days there have been two different threads in twox in which hidden cameras were discovered as usual before the mods moved in many of the initial comments supported the practice telling the ops that it wasnt a big deal so what were the events in question whats the context in which these cameras appeared how do you know these people were sincere how do you even know these people were male ie they were men acting on sexually driven impulses in other words im skeptical that the major subreddit targeted toward female users of the site was actively defending revenge porn the entire debacle that was the fappening the shutting down of various creepshot subs the argument is that voyeurism has been around since the dawn of time therefore its somehow worse to take away a peeping toms ability to peep than it is for an innocent person to be peeped on and have their privacy violated another straw man not to mention a nonsensical logical leap unsatisfied by the premise you acknowledging that voyeurism exists does not imply you defending it in the context of a persons privacy violated i do not consider this behavior to be healthy cut it with the snark affirmative consent this is probably your worst point since your characterization of the oppositions position as that it is impossible to gain enthusiastic consent without sacrificing the mood that it is natural for men to ravage women without their permission that sooner or later her desire will just kick in and he should go for it clearly indicates that you either do not having an understanding of the debate or that you are willfully misrepresenting their position to paint your opposition as defending predatory behavior affirmative consent shifts the burden of proof from the statecomplainant to the defendantrespondent in university title ix tribunals who now have to show that there was verbal consent at all points in time during and even after sex but what if there is no verbal consent routine sexual encounters occur with both people clearly consenting and acting on nonverbal cues without verbal enthusiastic consent which you erroneously or dishonestly describe as men ravaging women without their permission even acknowledges that they have no idea how an accused man can satisfy this burden until now these sanctions have been voluntarily adopted by colleges gives them the backing of a government mandate in addition to creating a vaguely and subjectively defined offense of nonconsensual sex the bill also explicitly places the burden of proof on the accused who must demonstrate that he or she took reasonable steps to ascertain whether the complainant affirmatively consented when the san gabriel valley tribune asked lowenthal how an innocent person could prove consent under such a standard her reply was your guess is as good as mine so ignoring the gender politics angle its shit legislation that violates due process establishing machinery for a state and federally sanctioned witchhunt betraying the core principles of western law i do not consider this behavior to be healthy cut it with the snark
PurplePillDebate,removed,have fun getting thrown out for being in contempt of court not going to word it that way of course but it is a sex crime and when you show your video in this ridiculous hypothetical scenario you will be registered as a sex criminal there is a difference between i rape women using violence and i made a sex tape i do not mean abstract metaphorical difference i mean difference in getting your ass pounded by a huge black guy named bubba and paying some fine and doing some work for public huge difference the fact that youre so worried about this at all is beyond me because youre not arguing in good faith you refuse to even consider an opposite scenario where a woman can lie and use it to her own advantage to fuck someone else people like you cannot be moved by reason because you cannot even fathom to use it in this case and im going to demonstrate it further in this post its manevil womangood in every possible case besides im not arguing with you for you do you know how rarely this even happens false rape charges theyre not that uncommon especially with rise of feminist culture do you want to do statistics with me i can do statistics with you you keep bringing up the swedish guy but if he was charged anyway despite showing his recording that doesnt exactly convince me that he wasnt guilty and example of your unhealthy gynocentrism and antimale hatred the guy was charged because a woman said he raped her he wasnt charged because he raped a woman then he was charged for sex tape he was charged for two different crimes that doesnt exactly convince me that he wasnt guilty he was guilty of taping without consent not of rape how was the recording even supposed to be prove his innocence if she was unaware she was being filmed please consider what you wrote and meditate a bit on it the recording was supposed to prove consent you can give consent unaware of being taped and the only reason why he would give the tape to the judge is because he had consent on it thats straight up scumbag behavior aye whose to say he didnt record himself raping her the judge you only seem to believe the sex was consensual because he said it was thats convenient lol no i believe the sex was consensual because he had videotape of it but let me give you a brief roundown of your rant a guy had a videotape he used to show the judge you still dont believe he didnt rape her its people like you who in normal and healthy civilizations are shunned and put far from positions of power that make taping sex a necessity because even with videoproof you still dont believe the guy didnt do it
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists dont understand this notion of blackstones of id rather guilty men walk free than to convict one innocent man for them its id rather men go to prison than to risk hurties one womans fee fees
PurplePillDebate,removed,nothing you said is applicable to us courts maybe somewhere else but not here if a judge rules that evidence proving a defendants innocence is inadmissible any conviction will be overturned on appeal youre talking out of your ass
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are not a lawyer are you im not either but i can tell youre just making shit up just because you want something to be true doesnt make it legally correct
PurplePillDebate,removed,can we ban the op from here too
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are a special kind of stupid the exclusionary rule is a legal principle in the united states under constitutional law which holds that evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendantsconstitutional rights is sometimesinadmissible for a criminal prosecution in acourt of law the man is the defendant you moron so this law doesnt apply
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are a special kind of person who talks out of her ass the exclusionary rule is a legal principle in the united states under constitutional law which holds that evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendants constitutional rights is sometimes inadmissible for a criminal prosecution in a court of law the man is the defendant and you are still talking out of your ass so this law doesnt apply better
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre still talking out of your ass if it proves he didnt commit the crime youd better believe its admissible ask one of those lawyers you work with
PurplePillDebate,removed,um no nice try its obvious what you think based on what you have written in this thread you have more compassion for women than men period
PurplePillDebate,removed,your reading comprehension is not improving note evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendants constitutional rights see how it does not say in violation of stephanies law the exclusionary rule exists to protect us from law enforcement not each other if the prosecution knew that evidence existed showing that she did not falsely accuse a man of rape she wouldnt be a defendant it wouldnt go to trial if the prosecutor hid the tape from the defense any conviction would get thrown out have you even watched law order this is really simple stuff
PurplePillDebate,removed,hawkings says of trump he is a demagogue who seems to appeal to the lowest common denominator myth my question is are more people than not of low intelligence this question doesnt seem to make any sense intelligence by what metric low relative to what arbitrary cutoff and is this of benefit to us as a society who is us as a society you just said that more people than not are of low intelligence how can the existence of the majority simultaneously be detrimental to the majority my suspicion is that you are falling into the typical elitist liberal trap of believing that only people who have similar beliefs as you are relevant are intelligent are even capable of intelligence a view of extreme arrogance that leads down the road to far left genocide purges and utopian experiments ending in mass starvation time and again feeling safe is the reason people support the rightwing according to studies lowintelligence adults tend to gravitate toward socially conservative ideologies the study found bro your paraphrase didnt even accurately reflect the content of the articles paraphrasing of the study let alone the contents of the study itself
PurplePillDebate,removed,change is happening in the us right now a major demographic shift and that scares the white folks combine that with the boogeyman under the bed terrorism and you have a fear stew of epic proportions then along comes trump getting the cracker vote all riled up it might be the last gasp for the neoconfederates before the large scale electoral shifts finally doom them to irrelevance
PurplePillDebate,removed,oooh baby youre fucking me sooo consentually
PurplePillDebate,removed,larry flynt is right
PurplePillDebate,removed,if hes ugly all of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,people who vote right stupid people who vote left smart this is how the left view the world hawkings is a big lefty
PurplePillDebate,removed,no there really isnt i cant use facts because you ignore them i cant use evidence because you dont even read the evidence you submit so why would you read mine so if not questioning your life decisions and who you are as a person what else do i have
PurplePillDebate,removed,alllriiiiiiiiight fine
PurplePillDebate,removed,not if you shoot it first
PurplePillDebate,removed,i love the barely concealed condescension of the privileged white elite who cant understand why the poor uneducated people they hate want to elect a man that doesnt treat them like cattle meant to carry out the will of a benign allknowing superstructure clearly theyre just idiots who dont know whats good for them
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why i stopped making any effort to find common ground with liberals years ago all i was met with was derision emotional appeals accusations of degeneracy and everything other than a logical refutation of ideas information is spread through memes not data what an idea means to you is more important than the facts behind it youre not supposed to be too critical of what stephen colbert or rush limbaugh says as their arguments arent designed to be indepth or factual it makes them invulnerable which in turn makes their ideas invulnerable
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah we know that already we dont need busybodies like yourself reminding us get a life
PurplePillDebate,removed,nobody who posts on the internet things like reddit mind you not instagram facebook etc is or ever was attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,take a look at anyone who went to college only to get a degree in gender studies and tell me again that conservatives are the ones with low intelligence
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes but lots of people do and yes it would be awesome if everyone had the sexual confidence to put themselves out there sober and deal with the rejections although ive noticed some very vocal feminists hate men chatting up women anywhere thats not a bar but theres a reason people drink and thats because its not exactly easy to put yourself out there again and again but both men and women like to get fucked up and fuck so if youre a feminist and accept the premise of female and male equality then you accept that men arent responsible for looking after women when drunk and that people are responsible for their own actions when drunk women are rarely called creepy like men are rarely called sluts in seriousness anyway this is why it can be considered gendered women and men mocking each other for undesirable physical characteristics is a different matter but for every feminist like yourself theres ten more delighting in mocking men about male tears also although i dont downvote opinions by identifying as a feminist youre signalling to me you believe in feminist concepts oppressed vs oppressor dichotomy unidirectional power dynamics sexism against men doesnt exist etc all these paradigms are inconsistent with empathy or understanding of a male perspective
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think it has more to do with hillary being full of shit women are primary victims of war my ass
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol someone has no idea how a court works yes and that person is you what you have written is idiotical driver bordering on one of the most stupid things ive ever seen written on ppd and the fact that you make up analogies without understanding how they work is laughable and the fact that you are calling out someone else for not understanding it while you yourself have zero understanding of law or morality behind it is hypocritical but probably not because hypocrisy requires a degree of intelligence let me give you several analogies in the same vein as your retarded one a cop can tape someone without their consent and have that same tape be held in a court of law this is basics with undercover cops and informants a copinformant doesnt just stop through a drug deal halfway through and say hey guise do i have ur consent to film need it for reasons suppose a group of five armed men break into your house and start raping and beating you a cop near your house can enter your house to save you and he does not have to have permission written in blood of ciswhitemales and approved by an army of eunuchs and bureaucrat to enter your house ever heard of a term httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprobablecauseunitedstates and i quote notable in this definition is a lack of requirement for public position or public authority of the individual making the recognition allowing for use of the term by citizens andor the general public if a man has reasonable suspicion that he will be charged of rape then it can be logically argued that he has a right to tape the encounter without consent of the other party just like if a cop has reasonable suspicion that this guy is a drug dealer he has a right to tape the encounter without the drug dealers consent then whats to prevent cops from just breaking and entering houses of people they think are guilty of a crime and if they find evidence no harm done whats to prevent them from tapping your phone and not telling you but if they catch evidence of a crime hey that was illegal but well admit it since you caught wrongdoing there is the state and there is the citizen and citizen requires protection from the state and not vice versa that protection is called due process and it makes sure that the king doesnt randomly kill innocents now i would let you ponder a bit why your analogy of a crime drama is absolutely retarded but i doubt youd come to a conclusion without hints hint there is a world of difference between a private citizen and a police officer a person empowered by the state a representative of state and de facto the state a private citizen doesnt have rights of a police officer but he also does not have as much obligations there is also thing called httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprecedent which states that if x was ruled in y by a judge sometime in history the x ruling in y has added legitimacy whenever y is around if false rape charge is thrown out because there was a recording it has precedent x being illegal for state and x being illegal in y case does not mean that x is necessarily illegal in z case violence is illegal so hitting someone is illegal but if someone hits you back you are allowed to defend yourself ditto for false rape charge attack and sexual tape defense
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you sure youre blue cause youre pretty hardcore and pretty sane for a bluepiller
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont think i called anyone stupid source please
PurplePillDebate,removed,your talking to the founder of tbp and on top of that given her posts and replies in this thread especially its pretty obvious that she doesnt care about girls hitting boys
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont be so dramatic thats just not the current subject her op pretty clearly outlines what she is discussing and why i realize that but the language and examples portray it as very one sided its biased and clearly a product of bias its pretty clear that op is only interested in the debate going exactly where she wants
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you not debate without calling someone stupid most people do not understand the nuances of law im betting youre one of them gets upset about someone calling someone else stupid proceeds to call them ignorant way to be a hypocrite mongrel
PurplePillDebate,removed,no it isnt thats ridiculous there are many intelligent and well educated people who believe in small government and conservative thinking some of the greatest minds of today and history are conservative this comment is the exact kind of near unbelievable stupidity that plagues that college campuses you are indoctrinated to believe that only smart people are liberals and dumb people are conservatives because that is reflected in the media you consume and the very near propaganda spewed by feminists and the left in classrooms there are historical reasons why liberals have taken over colleges and it has nothing to do with one side being inherently more right than the other
PurplePillDebate,removed,horrible and lazy conclusion correlation causation do you consider yourself educated because you should know this already
PurplePillDebate,removed,omg calm down
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont understand any of this you are dedicating your life to hatred you sound like a bad comic book villain of all the rp bios i have read this is the most bizarre
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice job answering the question oh wait
PurplePillDebate,removed,a woman runs game and its too tough for rp to take did you seriously just type that as a reply to a post which says all of that is fine there should be no protests she shouldnt have to hide shes free to do what she wants shes not hurting anyone shes not forcing these men to pay she is entitled to her opinions of these men reading comprehension

PurplePillDebate,removed,your modus operandi here screams im a troll you half ignore questions pose new ones move goalposts change your questions say things to bait people and then just move on to something new when called on it i mean you have yet to respond to the main question posed by ugornop i hope this sub recognizes your trolling and ignores you henceforth
PurplePillDebate,removed,you should reconsider how you go about your arguments you come off as intentionally obtuse deflecting providing only partial answers totally switching gears rather than continue what to you probably seems a bad path to go down for the sake of your arguments etc if these are nonintentional then do some reflecting please
PurplePillDebate,removed,i see apologies for not being a lawyer
PurplePillDebate,removed,women have to earn that shit now by doing things that please me this is what the feminists have wrought ladies enjoy omg thanks for the lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,yo man i heard you like upvotes so i put un upvote in your upboat so youll be steady if that shitstorm hits and tries to sink you with downboats also known as uboats because they are hide under waves of angry people who hate it when someone with common sense isnt drowned out because they didnt want to go with the flow
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh god i rememeber that crunk collective post it was amazing how so many feminists defended that blatant double standard it helped confirm what i thought for a while that there are a lot of feminists out there that are in it for female privilege there is not one thing in the idea that only women have the right to say now to sex free of judgement that says equality this is the kind of shit anti feminists are non feminists reference when they say feminism is poisoned
PurplePillDebate,removed,agree with this
PurplePillDebate,removed,great comment perhaps a post on this subject is in order

PurplePillDebate,removed,they say mrp is the worst because we have victims
PurplePillDebate,removed,theres plenty of hate for mgtow from both the trp and tbp camps since everyone suspects mgtow are mostly incels who just wont own up to being incel incels are easily mocked and seen as pathetic since we know their primary motivation for saying bad things about women in general is likely the fact that they cant get laid my favorite mgtow writersyoutubers are the ones who claim to have little problem getting laid but just find that they prefer to live their lives without women i have mixed feelings about incels who participate in mgtow forums since on one hand i think they have other issues with women they should probably get over before swearing off women on the other hand the idea behind mgtow is to think positively about living as a man without the need for validation from women and that could certainly do incels a lot of good if they are ready for it im sure someones going to read the above and want to respond to the effect of my problem with mgtow is all the misogyny for people who have sworn off women they sure do focus on women a lot my personal feeling on that is that online mgtow forums are like a support group they reinforce each others resolve not to get involved with women by reminding each other about why swore off women in the first place to me to complain about this is the same as complaining about alcoholics anonymous for talking about alcohol so much
PurplePillDebate,removed,women hate omegas

PurplePillDebate,removed,life in this society being at best an utter bore and no aspect of society being at all relevant to women there remains to civicminded responsible thrillseeking females only to overthrow the government eliminate the money system institute complete automation and destroy the male sex of course making sure not to destroy the male sex before theyve been able to develop full automation
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre talking about the most vocal faction of mgtows which are actually incels gone activist and incels who tried to improve but still cant get women then blues hate mgtow because they are incels complain about their inability to get laid or their unwillingness to do the work to get laid call out women on their bullshit accurately point out bad behavior in women and complain about the shitty state of the world mgtow hate is actually incel hate because when mgtows actually shut up and go their own way blues dont pay attention to them in fact blues dont even see mgtows who are actually going their own way because true mgtows really going their own way leave their basements get laid now and then hold jobs have hobbies and live masculine lives

PurplePillDebate,removed,when i am interviewing women for the position of first string cock wrap it is a very arduous process initially of course all candidates must submit to a series of general orifice measurements primarily to determine the amount of vaginal elasticity and lubrication as well as a lack of gag reflex preferred but not required from there the actual interview process begins and the candidate is bathed and brought before me the question what do you have to offer is one of the battery of questions she must answer as well as performance of an original artistic composition of her choice stripper pole provided upon prior request some of the criteria she is graded upon consists of but is not limited to enthusiasm for the position ability to cater to whims and general adoration of me those candidates with double jointed hips will be given a higher priority status based upon demonstrated flexibility after this battery of testing my team and i will confer to answer the question as to who is a good catch

PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont even think rtheredpill accurately reflects rp intriguing idea which i think is true and should be thought out more rtrp has always been for better or worse an internet reddit thing i think the core of red pill not trp is universally agreed upon
PurplePillDebate,removed,rp game is laid out so open and broken down it appears creepy strange weird or wrong but most things in life when laid out in the open and broken down can appear that way it ruins my whimsical magically view on things insightful
PurplePillDebate,removed,i definitely agree the idea of laying out in great detail actions that are meant to be subtle and reflexive is very counterintuitive this does tend to turn people off its comparable to reading the wikipedia page on humans
PurplePillDebate,removed,its different because men are the fucker and women are the fuckee wowyou must be boring in bed as long as shes not a complete starfish and she follows my lead shell be fine you have a lot to learn and it sounds like youre not interested in learning it

PurplePillDebate,removed,what does this have to do with red pill its about guys with lots of options who are lazy in relationships and avoid commitment the vast majority of red pill guys have very limited options so i dont see what this has to do with them
PurplePillDebate,removed,my observation is that theres roughly an equal amount of experienced women who like the idea of taking a mans virginity as there are experienced men who want to take a womans virginity either way there are very few of those people there are quite a lot of men who claim they want a virgin but really mean to say that they want a girl whos so attracted to them that she has to have them even though she has turned down every single guy that came before him when guys are actually dating a virgin most of them losevinterest quickly they realize theyre gonna have to wait for months or even a year before shes ready to have sex in general experienced high ncount people prefer others who are experienced whereas inexperienced low ncount people or virgins prefer an inexperienced or virgin partner

PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant even make it through a romcom unless its significantly more com than rom that said romcoms are meant to be feel good pickmeups not dating howto guides also something i hear a lot here sorry to commandeer atlas is that guys get the message from society that its ok to be kinda fat and dumpy looking and that you should be a doormat to women paraphrasing of course how is it that you were so attuned to the treat her like a princess message that romcoms are selling but somehow miss the six pack abs are total panty droppers message that i see peddled by literally every maleoriented publication and movie superhero movies action movies james fuckin bond shit even disney princes those guys are all fit and groomed as hell and they always get the girl in the end i dont mean this as a gotcha im genuinely curious

PurplePillDebate,removed,he like all terpers is mad he cannot blackmail a woman into being a sexually abused house slave for him because she no longer needs to depend on his money to live
PurplePillDebate,removed,let me tell you what hapened to me i had a girl coming over to me i told her explicitly to not come over if were not having sex because i dont have time for any games she comes over we start kissing get naked and then she says she doesnt want to have sex great i turn around and watch tv she then starts touching me and says she would like to cuddle i say no and tell her to go to sleep in another room she pick ups her clothes and goes to other room acting all insulted next day we go each separate way and we dont ever speak again a week later i get messages from our common friends her brother and family members what happened if im being crazy and how dare i lock a girl up in her room for not letting me have sex with her im like what the fuck she tried to destroy my reputation because all i wanted was to have sex with her i explicitly told her not to come if were not having sex i didnt push her once she said no but turned around i told her to go to sleep in another room once she wanted to cuddle everything was unlocked the room the appartment she had the phone with herself etc please tell me what kind of culture is that were leaving in she tried to destroy my reputation and life all of our common friends and her brothers are now looking at me funny i was lucky enough to prove some points and have some really close friends that believed me not everybody is that lucky there is no rape culture if i ask you to go to movies with me and you say no then i ask you again and you say yes the next time its a yes fuck you
PurplePillDebate,removed,so there are many guys here that think that we dont live in a rape culture guilty because world countries have actual rape cultures well actually its not that they have cultures they have weaponized rape for war but i guess were just mincing words here because the left just wants to call everything rape and no one it going to stop you from raping our ears with it this should be a clear cut case its not i see rape cases on a daily basis though i have seen evidence like you claim is open and shut seal a conviction it was one of my favorite interrogations that agent deserved a medal for how he flipped the guy he ignored her and got on top of her despite it conjecture she didnt want it to become horrible forcible rape so she went along with it only her testimony confirms this the ubiquity of information allows women to fabricate this lie easily to quote the commenters shame doesnt equal rape im sorry not only is that the law it should be illegal to initiate a legal process when shame is the motive as if her shame the next day means that he didnt just got on top of her and started kissing her without any consent still conjecture from another comment quote you did tell him no earlier but that doesnt make it rape this is true yet it is strong evidence investigators use its not proof its only evidence and its only evidence if its proven it sounds like its not and theres probably good reason for why there is not evidence if i crack my nuckles stand in an imposing way and tell a scrawny nerd that he should give me his lunch money he will agree to it as well but that doesnt mean that i didnt force him to do it by using an implied threat of violence and just because he didnt say no doesnt mean that it was a yes i stole his lunch money even though he handed it over to me youre suggesting she was intimidated yet she only described him being sexual with her not intimidating in nature what youre suggesting is that his mere presence and gumption was intended to cause fear you would lose this point in any civil court you made a false equivalence it looks like you called this reply downvoted but you have no link and your quote appears formatted like it was a double paste sounds like you were definitely pressured into it its not enough for a legal case but you absolutely should see a therapist hugs this is a sound reply what happened to her was just too bad but not saying no is just too bad as well the kid gloves can only protect people from so much she cant even self advocate her parents failed her her teachers failed her her friends clearly failed her she failed herself this is not a criminal matter its an educational matter she even stopped to say she enjoyed it the fuck shes too dumb to be raped rape is an active resistance to sexual advance and not only did she forget to resist shes saying meh wasnt that bad get the fuck over this shit stop seeking recreational outrage and let the professionals handle it if this is some form of advocacy your charity needs to be labeled let us be dumb and you should demonstrate with blinders noise cancelling headphones nose plugs and white canes get the fuck out of here with that sounds like you were definitely pressured into it its not enough for a legal case but you absolutely should see a therapist hugs were talking about the internet right this is reddit right you need to click random more sweetheart how are we not living in a rape culture when its totes okay for guys to just get on top of halfasleep women that already explicitly told them that there isnt going to be any sex and start having their way with them this is ripe for a facepalm reactiongif but i need you to understand that such a thing is only evidence not proof of rape in court not only that but the delivery of such a message can be sarcastic or playful you cant ignore that possibility to quote your commenter you withheld consent initially but then you implied consent by not refusing his advances later the statement is factually true if youre suggesting this is proof of rape culture then i cant help you understand the way the world works beyond your fantasy it opens the flood gates to false rape accusations not only is your definition and conjecture twisted as fuck you offer not solutions to the current system consent doesnt work like that consent doesnt work at all guess what happens when a sociopath gets consent and starts physically abusing hisher sexual partner theres a signed document saying i agree and then the sociopath tortures or maims the victim with consent shaking my damn head just because she didnt fight back and didnt say no yet again doesnt mean that she consents to it okay fair to say he knew that she wanted to sleep conjecture he knew that she didnt wanted to have sex this doesnt even rate as conjecture its hearsay she regrets that she didnt fight back only admissible in court as testimony and without evidence to support it he totally ignored her boundaries and just went for it despite her will smh why would he even listen to her now when she says stop if he didnt listen to her no earlier guess well never know because she was too dumb to selfadvocate if it even was rape if you cant lift a finger for yourself and you call this crime somewhat enjoyable what do you really expect not only was there no violence there was no history of violence no build up hardly any context i wouldnt be surprised if a cop listening to this fell asleep halfway in this is such a stretch for anyone to believe it has emo suicide girl written all over it she let him have his way and participated because she knew he wouldnt listen just like he didnt listen already according to her since when does she need to tell him no over and over again how about more than once and maybe during the rape get the fuck out of here with that shit she isnt ashamed for having fucked him shes ashamed for being a victim possibly but at this point not probably her regretting it doesnt mean that he didnt rape her this is the strongest statement you could have made and it took you like paragraphs to say it one we are not going to have sex tonight should be enough yet it doesnt absolve someone from selfadvocacy how hard was it really to say no once how hard was it to push him away once how hard was it to cross your legs this isnt kindergarten were not talking about children are we were talking about people who are supposed to be able to vote about war maybe womens suffrage was a waste of time if this is what we get s i thought i would cool off typing it all out but you really are wasting everyones time with this relenting to sex is not the same as consenting to sex okay but its also not rape you psycho
PurplePillDebate,removed,people like you are why women are getting raped en masse this isnt civil please edit
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow look at all the hamsters running oo
PurplePillDebate,removed,i would extend the question to ask what if any precautions do you take to protect yourself from danger
PurplePillDebate,removed,virtue signaling yes you are wrong
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh stop you cant spin this as him getting overly emotional and shaming you when you did nothing wrong nice attempt to try and change the narrative why dont you just own up to you own behavior that youve admitted to lots of people would consider what you did to be unacceptable youre being obtuse if you cant see that
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice attempt at shaming and virtue signaling youre still really emotional here
PurplePillDebate,removed,virtue signaling shaming
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive stopped listening youre virtue signaling and shaming
PurplePillDebate,removed,no it is not being discussed its now become virtue signaling and shaming
PurplePillDebate,removed,no youre the one who is shaming and virtue signaling and ive explained how and why
PurplePillDebate,removed,literally nothing in your feminist wackadoodle minds qualifies as consent she could sign a notarized letter saying the sex is consensual but if she changed her mind after she only signed because she was threatened youve redefined consent to be whatever the woman says it is thats why i laugh when you idiots talk about affirmative consent as if that would do anything at all if you really want to solve rape culture stop teaching young women that regret rape
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have sexual assault ptsd i refuse to initiate because of thoughts like that one its a good part of why sex is terrifying for me and why i freeze up explains you pretty well
PurplePillDebate,removed,i love to trigger
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think that everyone incapable of trust in relationships is damaged yes that apparently hurts your feelings which wasnt my intent presumably youre redpill and too damaged to trust the people you date my condolences if so civility aside though your hurt feelings dont change healthy norms for human beings or redpillers inabilities to meet those standards pity that that upsets you but recognizing that shortcoming will be the first step toward emotional maturity
PurplePillDebate,removed,elohel how would you just find out shes been hooking up what a ridiculous question
PurplePillDebate,removed,hahhahahaahahah yeah because kids tell their parents about their sexual experiences particularly large scale escapades that makes so much sense thanks for the laugh
PurplePillDebate,removed,purple pill woman here but im going to offer my view on this anyway women are judged by looks men are judged by charisma social standing and when they get older careermoney smv at least for men is based on many factors not just appearance
PurplePillDebate,removed,no matter how hard you wish for it to not be true it is drunk girls are easy the idiotic western rape laws are even based on it
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is a study posted below by one of your own go read it and dont challenge grown men
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think this sub has more reasonable moderate redpillers who have relationship experience
PurplePillDebate,removed,there are things ill never be able to talk to my parents about and a shit ton of things theyll never talk to me about its just common sense im in my this is a moot point just like if youre an atheist and your parents believe in god theyll never accept that youre actually an atheist and its not a phase
PurplePillDebate,removed,what if you lose attraction towards him like you did towards other guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,well are you gonna deny it i would expect you to deny it as i have become quite adept at identifying people who change the facts of what their story is online since others wont be able to verify it due to anonymity
PurplePillDebate,removed,you wish then you wouldnt need mrp to get respect and a fucking bj
PurplePillDebate,removed,i never said ptsd doesnt exist i said its not evidence of rape vaginal scarring would fall into physical evidence
PurplePillDebate,removed,where did the concept that stoic men have no emotions come from of course they have emotions all people have emotions the difference is in how they are expressed and stoic men tend to have rather tight reign on their emotional responses
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah in general what else am i suppose to say
PurplePillDebate,removed,why do you keep trying to talk in these general terms im not speaking to some vague amorphous everyman im speaking to you you are damaged if youre incapable of trustbased relationships and your feelings are apparently hurt enough by this judgment from a stranger that you have to try to pretend that judgment isnt directed at you i dont know why you care so much about a strangers opinion of your alfalfa relationships bro but at the very least take responsibility for those feelings youre not a good enough liar to effectively deny them anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you honestly expect people to take you seriously you are clearly an ignorant misandrist with a very low iq
PurplePillDebate,removed,pua is about getting womens validation they just wanna know the women will sleep with them and theyll do almost anything to get the validation its all about becoming casanova
PurplePillDebate,removed,how else can a man who is age have sex with a yearold that same middle age or senior man cant just get it for free first he would have to approach someone in his league and somewhat near his age group then do all the back and forth in the dating scene just to work his way up to finally having sex with her by that time he absolutely has spent as much money as that escort and triple the effort stress aggravation etc

PurplePillDebate,removed,they also caution against anime in other posts all that bluepill mindwiping is difficult to overcome if you think the most pandering and undemanding of inoffensive fantasy animation is a how to manual there is no such thing as an equality relationship in your head additionally it has nothing to do with getting things done in your head a relationship is not a process or task its a story that plays out in a womans head too bad theyre not all telling the same story but its not just about her story unless you dont have any personality at all basically all women are submissive or lean that way
PurplePillDebate,removed,save your fake apologies for someone whos willing to swallow the bs like yourself its easy to tell yourself you dont care what people online think but what you think about yourself matters you know i could forgive everything else except your sickening egotism your worst sin was letting yourself buy into the dumb hamster lies these bitches have been spinning to justify their own misdeeds oh its all hubbies fault oh hes so boring i know i could be a great wife if he was just more like you wub sure why wouldnt you believe that its flattering to your ego and it massages away that little kernel of guilt over shattering another mans life much easier to pull the trigger if you can make yourself believe he had it coming its all a bunch of horse shit though youre not clued in to feminine nature you have no stunning insights to offer the husbands of these whores youre the side dick a bit of entertainment and escape from it all before she goes back to the life and stability she knowingly chose you think she wanted a spontaneous husband thats the last thing one of these two faced degenerate harlots wants she wants hubby nice and docile and stable and predictable if he wasnt she wouldnt have married him shed have dumped him just like all the other spontaneous exciting men she forsook in pursuit of cash stability security a comfortable lifestyle
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh my apologies i wouldnt want to commit the crime of being uncivil while someone else is gloating about fucking other mens wives and how much those men deserved it my bad

PurplePillDebate,removed,your penis envy is blatant
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think u just envy male bodies in general penii included

PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah its unhealthy do these clowns look happy to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre disgusting sorry that other people can look in the mirror and love themselves and you cant i dont see how someone can spew something like that and not see how disgusting they are
PurplePillDebate,removed,the fact that you dont think they can be paints you as biased before you even take part in the discussion if you come to a debate thinking your opponent has absolutely no value to their arguments before they even make them then you are not there to debate at all youre just there to argue with people youre one of the worst and most dishonest debaters on this sub all you do is get angry because you cant seem to believe that anyone can disagree with your all knowing self
PurplePillDebate,removed,this person is not redpill they are just a concern troll or false flag look at their posts is there anything redpill about them
PurplePillDebate,removed,this person is not trp they are a concern troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,no redpill person would care so much about word or feelings and get so involved in that debate no true scotsman huh maybe you should keep learning
PurplePillDebate,removed,no i know my logical fallacies but this isnt one of them its like saying no true rper would have oneitis for a girldate a single motherhave really bad approach anxiety if you do these things it means you have not read the sub enough and employed rp concepts in order to overcome these problems in order to consider yourself rp you need to stop pining after girls or being scared to approach them if you do these things it shows a blatant misunderstanding of rp theory and that you havent learnt enough if you care so much about the way people talk and employing feminine methods of speech then it shows a blatant misunderstanding of rp theory and that you havent learnt enough its true that some terpers dont subscribe to all the tenets of the philosophy like awalt or whatever but some are non negotiable speaking like a feminised faggot is something that doesnt allow you to be rp
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre disgusting too hating someone for how they look you dont know how they got that way fucking disgusting

PurplePillDebate,removed,this should be good
PurplePillDebate,removed,when you reach around twelve or thirteen years old you begin to understand that people lie because its when a lot kids start to lie more for their own personal gain they dont understand it consciously as sugarcoating the realities of life but they have the sense to not take every word out of someones mouth as truth and middle school is when it becomes apparent to us nonautistics that the athletes and bad boys are getting girls and the kind nerds are not
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah i just assume people arent complete idiots if you havent figured out that every single thing about how to attract someone says look your best and actually talk to women your genes deserve to die with you

PurplePillDebate,removed,doesnt matter
PurplePillDebate,removed,right like is he serious with this
PurplePillDebate,removed,sorry i forgot that there are women on the internet theres this thing called the metric system that uses standardized prefixes and suffixes those are things that come before and after words to indicate the place value of numbers you remember the tens place and the hundreds place from grade school right the metric system makes measurement really easy by using these words to tell you what place numbers go in well one of the metric system prefixes is kilo which means for example a kilogram of cocaine that your drug dealer buys from his supplier is one thousand grams of cocaine because the prefix kilo comes before the word gram because kilo begins with the letter k people sometimes abbreviate the words one thousand with the letter k when theyre typing so would be an abbreviation for because k means kilo or one thousand
PurplePillDebate,removed,k
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol rando on the other side of the world worries about me bless their heart
PurplePillDebate,removed,proper research or running ones mouth like a chode which is preferred
PurplePillDebate,removed,whats so bad about women just staying with their husbands how about the fact that sometimes people just dont work out well together youre a hateful asshole my mother is completely independent and does just fine on a middle class income oh and my parents were never married
PurplePillDebate,removed,not on my planet theyre disgusting faggots id use as target practice
PurplePillDebate,removed,and why would we care what you like
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was hoping for an answer that had more substance and was less about you for example you could have said you dislike hipsters because they are the symptoms of a gentrifying neighborhood the neighborhoods lower income residents and rich culture are now disappearing but no it was just because you dont like effete men
PurplePillDebate,removed,the big point of the redpill is that things are deterministic most importantly including gender relations because there is no free will the whole game is now to use evopsych to explain experiences like my jealous hatred toward rich white art school college students caused by their disinterest cause by my ineptitude i used to be a moral idealist but now i view those notions with tragic bitterness ive admitted that morality has little effect on desire women desire power circulating themselves in formations around it despite them being progressives my anger towards blue pillers is based on their attempts to uphold the notion of morals that reddit should represent some sort of community rather than just user generated clickbait im so confused why people post on here as if there isnt something seriously deficient about them why dont they just hang out with their friends or actually have the sex they claim they have why torment me with their lies
PurplePillDebate,removed,its hard not to be a bitch to some people when youre misanthropic and they piss you off so much
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont be a ungrateful peasant
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wonder if it is because you dont like men that do feminine better than you
PurplePillDebate,removed,its all crap that single moms feed to their sons which is why single moms are the worst moms thankfully my dad was around so i didnt grow up delusional about how the world actually worked
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont forget their flaw in invariably siding with the third world with its dindus and mohammeds who are absolutely notorious for raping and beating women shame on us white males for not letting them take over our countries and rape all our feminists
PurplePillDebate,removed,as someone who grew up around these pussies youre do wrong
PurplePillDebate,removed,cuz africans just rape women anyway lol why use tinder the app when you can use a piece of tinder and smack a woman upside the head with it then drag her to ones mudhut
PurplePillDebate,removed,look no further than britain for an example of the terrible fate that will soon befall western civilization dindus and mohammeds beating and raping women and girls left and right while shitlibs wring their hands and ask what did we privileged whites do to cause this they couldve allied with hitler and all wouldve been well for the next several centuries at least but no churchill just had to throw a spanner in the works now look at europe overrun by moors and apemen not since the fall of rome has there been a civilizational collapse on this level thank god theres an ocean between me and you commie multicultural fucks
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you on something you claimed that incels make their whole identity about lack of sex i replied that its actually you who are choosing to reduce them to that to which you replied that yeah thats all they are to you but just because thats all they are to you doesnt mean thats all they are to themselves so yeah what you think of them doesnt matter what matters is reality
PurplePillDebate,removed,who gentrifies other than white people lolol now im imagining a poor white neighborhood getting run out by genteel black and mexican gangsters in bow ties sipping earl grey tea and wearing suspenders hahahahahahahaha
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you already knew these things then you shouldnt need red pill wives if youre at rpwi then you have had some issues that have caused you some relationshipsexual difficulties nope im fine actually managed to lock down the perfect man with no issues before ever finding rpw im just an introvert who likes hanging out on reddit and find rpw an interesting community of people i mostly agree with you need to stop hamstering up excuses to cover for your own youthful wishful thinking laziness and lack of intuition because thats really all it is if you literally couldnt figure out that attractive boys are gasp attractive thats pretty amazing
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you sure youre a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck off you cunt
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol because youre a pita and acting like a year old brat
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah ok

PurplePillDebate,removed,when you get with a boyfriend all that stops suddenly you have to make real conversation you get to talk a lot more with women who dont hype everything up youre no longer the heart of the party you cant go out randomly and have cool stories to tell the next day from the strangers you met men no longee laugh at your jokes and you no longer get free stuff so basically you didnt really have much of a personality and guys just tolerated you because they thought they could bone you either get to be more interesting and funny or find different friends

PurplePillDebate,removed,eh id say anyone who openly identifies as a redpiller falls in the second point why cause it makes it easier to mock and denigrate them that way and you can feel better about getting your outrage porn fix its easier to dismiss rp and feel selfsatisfied in your superiority when you classify all rpers as whiny bitter neckbeards so i get it but dont pretend you are actually understanding anything
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not trolling i just dont feel like getting into a fight with an evil red piller

PurplePillDebate,removed,you show yourself the immaturity of women your mother being a prime example for you as people grow up they gain more experiences and in many cases become more mature this is observable in both men and women and while its true that some people never mature that can happen in both genders gaining new experiences gives new knowledge which makes you less naive not less mature you will still resist taking responsibility for your actions when you can get away with not you will still live in a world that revolves around yourself you will still be driven by your emotions first not logic as years past were learning and in most cases this causes us to grow up i have seen it many times im now and while i dont think im mature at all i can swear im a very different person than i was at even my mother who is a total moron has changed and slightly improved over the years here is your biggest personal proof your mother who has been alive for decades more than you is still an idiot shes still immature does stupid shit i bet shes quite capable of learning yet cant help but be this way my mom isnt different degrees and career and being a fast learner dont matter at i took responsibility for my actions already i felt pretty mature already and was able to maintain a relationshipimmature men cannot big difference in men is by they tend to value their time and have more of a goal or purpose in life so they quit gaming and partying and wasting time as much women at are still as immature as they are when but now they are less naive and realize having a baby is a great way to lock down a man to better guarantee some financial support from him i dont get at all what trpillers mean when they say women stop mentally maturing at does their brain stop developing or something it still learns but it doesnt continue to change the way mens brains do men gain more logic more vision are you able to take a set of beliefs and a situation and viscerally experience as in feel smell hear see the situation as if you were someone actually living that experience through someone elses eyes and no it doesnt matter whether men mature slower than women because while trp says that men mature slower it also says they keep maturing for the rest of their lives not that their brains stop developing men take longer to hit maturity more is developed in their brain but at men are more mature than women are overall they act more like adults however women are done maturing then as they have no need for more maturity they are quite capable of child raising at that age being driven by emotions instead of cold logic never changes for women you cannot act like an adult if your emotions are in control also liking things that are childish doesnt necessarily mean youre immature i know guys in their who watch anime and avatar the legend of korraand good for them its a hobby and it doesnt necessarily show maturity childish literally means immature immature behavior is child like behavior mature behavior is adult like behavior children follow their emotions not their logic watching anime has little to do with maturity but that said many animes are meant for thinking men and are incredibly mature by the way i dont think that women mature faster than men is true in all cases either there are many teenage boys who are more mature than the average teenage girl right teenage boys that take responsibility for their actions and life and act more like adults i know i have made other posts about it in the past btu i insist because nobody managed to even explain to me what mental maturity means in their narrative its like they throw it around without explaining it sufficiently saying that women stop maturing at the age of is a serious accusation that can have many implications in todays society for example why hire women if they have the mentality of an years old when you wouldnt hire a real years old so trpillers should be able to prove it and explain what it means women are very good at straight forward tasks things that can be done mechanically the same mechanism over and over they are decent at managing peoples emotionssocial game especially more self aware women and handling accounts generally keeping accounts happy plenty of jobs exist that women can do well and typically women are not going for intellectual jobs
PurplePillDebate,removed,what lie bitch

PurplePillDebate,removed,unzip my pants
PurplePillDebate,removed,😂😂😂
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is with the genuine intent to educate women are prostitutes they exchange sex for commitment

PurplePillDebate,removed,which i dont personally think exists but thats beside the point are you one of those idiots who thinks racism and sexism only exist in terms of power dynamics
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok
PurplePillDebate,removed,there was backlash when it was first announced there has been backlash at every stage the concept was terrible the motivation for doing a remake was terrible and the trailer was so bad even one of the main cast admitted it was bad he and the cast were likely annoyed with it at the time but instead of dealing with it like responsible adults they decided to shame their target audience i might as well see it to upset some losers you sound extremely petty nobody is upset youre wasting your money on this
PurplePillDebate,removed,no
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound bitter dosent matter if you got cheated on and dumped dont extend your personal situation to the rest of men some women pick better men

PurplePillDebate,removed,gee getting women to ingest all kinds of mind and body altering hormones when they have no idea wtf this is going to do to women and clearly you women taking them dont even know the basic shit about what they do to you what could go wrong it is just too important that you can go get fucked bareback at any time damn the consequences like massive increase in breast cancer who cares cause youll be all old by the time the breast cancer kills you and we dont want to fuck you when you all old go take your pill
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh ive been thinking about getting that for my gf because im not ok with her taking crazy hormones that will fuck up who she is attracted to and fuck with her sex drive and hey that might cause her to gain weight fucking gross but then id have to pay to have it removed later when i start putting babies in her i can always just use her mouth during her fertile times
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh look another woman that needs her fainting couch i wonder who this damsel is that is scarred for life because some dude tried to have sex with her in a way she did not like

PurplePillDebate,removed,just stuff bpers have made up in their head like the rest of their reality
PurplePillDebate,removed,i find it funny though cause isnt porn geared to men why would hetero men want to see huge dicks if youve met continental europeans the culture difference regarding sex and male selfimage is very clear americananglo culture has a strong current of cuckold fetish along with a racemixing fetish in the early century chinamen were the object of anglo cuckold fantasies in literature and silent film today the focus of cuckold porn is black men now back to the conversation about penis size here is an example of and in vintage porn nsfw this transformation into bigdickfixation occured sometime in the it was likely a sideeffect of the invention of the goldilocks yellowwhiteblack race theory this was when the small asian penis stereotype was created before race scientists proved whites had the biggest brains highest iqs and were the most sexually restrained after several wars in asia japanese automakers asian economic miracles and china opening up new studies suddenly found asians had the biggest brains first we must admire the apparent cranial expansion of asians over the last halfcentury when researchers consistently reported their having smaller brains than whites obviously this implies the possibility of a comparable expansion in blacks more likely it implies the possibility of scientists ﬁnding just what they expect when the social and political stakes are high john phillipe rushton was the race scientist that found asians had the biggest brains but he reframed brain size as being inversely correlated with penis size rushton reorganized the racial ranking methodology to white men now being just right in the middle the first time the goldilocks theory of race and the asian penis stereotype appeared was in his study with bogaert this theory became mainstream after a debate on canadian television with david suzuki do you remember the days when asians were considered dumb and were included in affirmative action
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not hard for no baller to get a model xd these women are literally on their dick for a come up can you speak english thanks

PurplePillDebate,removed,yes its all correct hypergamy in action afbb is real it is just so common it seems normal
PurplePillDebate,removed,have you seen that intelligence distribution curve turns out women are more concentrated around average level intelligence there are fewer super dumb women than men and more importantly fewer super smart women than men so considering this to a smart guy an average woman would indeed seem less intelligent than his male peers also i guess it is safe assume that being emotional is inversely correlated with intelligence which is what rp anecdotes are based on

PurplePillDebate,removed,turners white yes wealthy sure male privilege bzzt wrong men are absolutely not privileged in this way i know you are factresistant but it is a well known fact that men get longer sentences than women for comparable crimes feminists even acknowledge this although they are ideologically bound to spin it as positive misogyny there is no male privilege in justice there is a very obvious female privilege which is probably why youre deflecting roof is unlikely to get death after he appeals where are you getting this do you think that they should have got lighter sentences you mean be sentenced as if they were women wouldnt that be a miscarriage of justice
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is such a cuck thread we should stone your ass op
PurplePillDebate,removed,xd pats you on the back and gives you a snowflake award

PurplePillDebate,removed,shhh dont point out their inconsistencies their brain may break when they realize that change who they are to win an online argument
PurplePillDebate,removed,what fat women have way more value than fat men i see overweight and obese women dating and marrying decently looking guys all the time ive never seen a fat guy with a decent looking girlfriend unless he is super rich i guess
PurplePillDebate,removed,women always go up in value because men will always be thirsty smv is more of a relevant measure for men because women are always valuable
PurplePillDebate,removed,no go cry about it femboy😭
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure im altright and agree with that so youre really barking up the wrong tree lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do fit into the alt right i am altright and i agree with that statement
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes i know that most rp men select against women like me i aint mad about it your point is
PurplePillDebate,removed,effective reproductive yield this is the most spergy thing ive read all week
PurplePillDebate,removed,bring marriage back basically just a reversal of feminism and giving men back absolute control over women
PurplePillDebate,removed,women in the good ol days werent marrying niceguy goodprovider men because they wanted to they were forced to due to financial dependency and social restrictions it was not their feminine nature to submit to these guys they just did what they needed to do to fit in socially and to survive marriage and sex were transactions everybody knew it and it was just how things were she didnt really burn with desire to fuck him but he gave her a good home and took good care of him so she fucked him and had his kids that was the deal this isnt entirely correct the primary social values have completely changed people married out of social obligation because they thought it was the right thing to do not out of financial necessity thats why my mum married my dad i even read an interview with shaun ryder of the happy mondays recently and he recounted how he got married really young even though he was in a really successful band because it was just what people did at that time society was much more communityfocused than today it was far less individualistic and atomised if you go back far enough it was like amish society today so people didnt see the satisfaction of their selfish personal desires as being a priority this was not the guiding principle of society the mass availability of contraception has also had a massive influence but social values have completely changed people didnt get together in the past in order solely to survive although it may also have served this purpose they did it because if you didnt do it then you would be a pariah
PurplePillDebate,removed,i genuinely genuinely wonder why on earth a woman would like to create laws that serve the male imperative and go against herselfher gender i will never understand the minds of conservative women
PurplePillDebate,removed,legalize polygamy and thus refine the transition of resources of top men to soft harems women will more openly get to choose a polygamous lifestyle with an extremely high value man or a monogamous lifestyle with a lesser man no more window dressing or romanticizing when this becomes more visible to men growing up they will try harder to not be at the bottom also make chemical castration for incel high risk men and sexual offenders a commonly prescribed treatment to prevent what typically happens in environments with many untethered males
PurplePillDebate,removed,so like a sperg to be fishing for in insults
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah im actually autistic true story
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah theres this one guy who follows me around calling me a troll on every post i write he even decided to make an entire post that devolved into witch hunting

PurplePillDebate,removed,i feel bad for that user still dont know who he is
PurplePillDebate,removed,ha ha good women you mean like you lololololol
PurplePillDebate,removed,just typical annoyance at those who have shitty reading comprehension
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop being obtuse its right there in the op and my entire post history improve your smv both rp and i agree on this sexism and misogyny are wrong rp and i disagree on this seriously pick up the pace this isnt college math to figure out
PurplePillDebate,removed,missus didnt get wet after he mopped the floor and did the dishes so no rumpy pumpy
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats not an argument use your words like an adult
PurplePillDebate,removed,regardless please explain the goal of this generational systemic attempt to conceal what women actually find attractive why would anyone want to do that who gains anything from this system dont worry discussing this with him he put his head in the sand and wont accept that this is only true for him and that everyone else never has made this experience he needs everything to be explicitly told so when chicks contestantly hook up with tall masculine and muscular guys on tv it simply doesnt count because they dont explicitly say that they sleep with them because of those traits and if they do it it doesnt matter because he always finds a way to hamster it away
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh it is incela get approached alot their suicide notes say otherwise
PurplePillDebate,removed,if a woman hits me she consents to sex too
PurplePillDebate,removed,no retard poor ugly musicians who arent locally famous get laid because they are tall
PurplePillDebate,removed,cuz teh womynz r out to get you and divorce rape you out of all ur lucrative stem treasures thats why not before dead bedroom and cucking you for chad though
PurplePillDebate,removed,men deal with sluts because we cant help our penises stiffening to visual stimulation we dont like them though this reads like rationalization watch what they do not what they sayif men disliked sluts as much as they claim to then their penises would shrivel up in disgust when a slut shows up not stand readily at attention p how do you not understand such basics of male sexuality ah right expecting understanding is unfair pressure from me to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,basically shes dumb acting like cant tell the difference
PurplePillDebate,removed,rofl libtards
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you want men to lower their standards so you are in their league sounds like that will go over well
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have to say the total lack of basic punctuation lack of capital letters and misspelling its whose and id for heavens sake not whos and id is such a strain on the eyes it muddles the content of the comment
PurplePillDebate,removed,also youre probably not as hot as you think
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah man the good parts of the red pill attract women who a can think for themselves b arent that insecure and c who arent caught up in all that feminism propaganda bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,narcissistic women are more prone to try and prove their worth to a guy who is acting noninterested no thats not how narcissism works at all narcissistic people assume their worth and look for people to continually reaffirm it something called narcissistic supply well i got over trp its not me i tried a new game plan it consists of looking good smiling and being nice yet forward my opener is hey name you seem cool nice to meet you im name i got over trp and tired a new game plan thats exactly like trps game plan something crazy has happened the crazy girls with daddy issues have been replaced by sweet conservative girls less drama less crazy less headaches so let me get this straight cold approaching magically made all of the crazy girls disappear that doesnt even pass the correlative sniff test let alone the causal one its anecdotal but i really feel the difference is night and day literally all of trp content can be replaced by look aboveaverage and talk to a lot of girls which is the entirety of your new got over trp game plan as well
PurplePillDebate,removed,must suck to have one big mouth ruin your reputation for the lot of you fine upstanding people too bad no one can empathize
PurplePillDebate,removed,sometimes i want to hear the hamster like as a woman i would never therefore all women would never solopcism at its finest its endlessly entertaining and predictable to see how often womens and feminized mens default response to anything they disagree with in regards to gender dynamics is met with a personalization to the contrary its always the notinmycase story about how their personal anecdotal exceptional experience categorically proves a universal opposite by order of degrees women have a natural tendency for solipsism – any dynamic is interpreted in terms of how it applies to themselves first and then the greater whole of humanity men tend to draw upon the larger rational more empirical metaobservations whether they agree or not but a woman will almost universally rely upon her isolated personal experience and cling to it as gospel if its true for her its true for everyone and experience and data that contradict her selfestimations those have no bearing because shes not like that
PurplePillDebate,removed,but peeeeeeeeemmmmm my feelerz hurt
PurplePillDebate,removed,haha this is so spot on yes there are some women that are superior to other women look at all the cunts getting angry and denying this calling this boring a cop out and backwards as if they can understand

PurplePillDebate,removed,well find solace in the fact that even though countless of mass murders are done by white menyou guys arent categorized as mass murderers just lone wolves
PurplePillDebate,removed,how being classed a loan wolf is better than being classed as a terrorist is just beyond me its good for the group of people you relate to a muslin does something all muslims bad a white person murders little children oh hes mentally illand a lone wolf
PurplePillDebate,removed,you got owned uplaytimeisover
PurplePillDebate,removed,society sees men as disposable whos problems dont matter of because of patriarchy no one cares about all the men who are homeless or all the men who blow their heads off so no one will care if men are also unsure if themselves insecure and going through their own body image issues society only cares about women
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not sure i can say its true that a lot of subconscious effort went into getting the best genes though you should be planning on spermjacking an alpha right now and working out how you can fool your beta provider into thinking the kid is his

PurplePillDebate,removed,youre an incel if you call yourself one
PurplePillDebate,removed,sexual attraction has nothing to with whether or not something is within ones control men tend to be less attracted to obese women women are not attracted to shorter than average men simple as that the fact that one can be changed while the other cant is irrelevant to all this you know what is relevant to all of this the fact that i am not a hypocrite for disliking fat as a short man which is what this thread is about so dont tell me that the basis of my argument is irrelevant to my thread also from a reproductive pov it makes sense for women to not be attracted to short men precisely because it is not something within the mans control and is highly determined by his genes while it makes less sense for a man to not be attracted to obese women because as you said it is something within her control and is less hereditary it only makes sense from this pov if you think that short men are inferior in which case you shouldnt be passing whatever genes made you so impressionable to certain cultures height fetish
PurplePillDebate,removed,if i were a man id go for watson especially because shes a feminist id enjoy dominating her in bed and telling her that no matter how much she blabs she knows shell always beg for some good cocking i will tease her and not allow her to cum until she admits that i am the man and that no matter how feminist she is still my little bitch and shell love it then ill slap her and tell her to make breakfast there is something appealing in the fantasy of making a woman my lady in the streets but whore in the sheets
PurplePillDebate,removed,emma watson all day every day shes hot british doesnt fuck black guys and shes hermione
PurplePillDebate,removed,attractiveness is not objective how fucking thick are you just because you personally find ripped men attractive doesnt mean everyone else must as well youre literally telling someone their brain is wrong because they have different preferences to you what a fucking idiot
PurplePillDebate,removed,the difference between a good girl and a trashy girl
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre literally telling someone their brain is wrong because they have different preferences to you what a fucking idiot if im wrong feel free to correct me i think youre starting to realise youre full of shit which is why youre screaming ad hominem
PurplePillDebate,removed,holy shit you genuinely just cant get your head around the idea that attraction is subjective you are incredibly thick and a lost cause
PurplePillDebate,removed,the way you talk and the arguments you make suggests that youre just an inexperienced kid going through the putting the world to rights phase of growing up
PurplePillDebate,removed,not as trashy as the white girls who fuck black guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,explicitly talking about stuff like this removes the thrill and and instead of an organic exciting situation you end up with nerds roleplaying
PurplePillDebate,removed,because just trying that shit out is how you and up as a rapist not accused falsely of rape but actually being a rapist once the beaten and chocked woman who was terrified the entire time gets to a phone and calls the cops this would only ever happen to an actually autist
PurplePillDebate,removed,haha this is literally just a back and forth of everyone accusing everyone of living in their own bubble sad
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a quick one

PurplePillDebate,removed,there are two responses to anxiety others than freezing read your own damn article i also find it cute how weve only just found this miraculous new third response to anxiety that now absolves women of any accountability when they freeze up because muh feewings

PurplePillDebate,removed,you really have all the feels today what happened penis guilt did you suddenly realize you are the same gender as donald trump at this point im just suprised you havent brought the nazis into this yet
PurplePillDebate,removed,this post is so stupid it must have been made by a woman or a very young guy if you are a man you must be a retarded shutin yes the schoolboy was fantasizing about his teacher and the girl next to him in class and his babysitter from last weekend and his best friends sisters so on and so forth its not about the status id overwhelmingly prefer to have sex with women i am attracted to there are women of lower status that i would much prefer to bang because theyre much more to my preference physically attractive than either emma watson or taylor swift you really wiffed on this point op consider madonna or oprah two of the higheststatus american women around do you think more men want to bang madonna and oprah or emma and tswift duh men compete for attractive women youre describing the history of everything ever oh is that why sugar daddysugar baby dating sites exist because old moneyed men want young women with status now youre confounding sexual partners with marriage they are not the same the qualifications and standards are different i think thats where a lot of your confusion lies
PurplePillDebate,removed,what im saying men do it too to paint a full unbiased picture unlike you ive always presented both sides to an argument both perspectives my highest rated comments on ppd are me showing both male and female woes youre always downvoted because youre a rage queen who seems to only enjoy showing one perspective
PurplePillDebate,removed,some day you might learn that abstract thinking is wrong and frightening i chose to remain in my concrete bunker where i only need to deal with what i can see with my two eyes and touch with my two hands it is a limited existence but it is my existence and sometimes just existing is all i really need
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont tell me what i cant do
PurplePillDebate,removed,malik i have idea for how to makeing money on youtube quick pretend to fuck car while i film on smartphone stopen from american tourist
PurplePillDebate,removed,you obviously cant read and btw trpers didnt invent the term alpha its been around for a while
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know this is trp in a nutshell but i dont think the terpers will understand it
PurplePillDebate,removed,probably she could probably divorce rape a rich beta and then go with your plan a too the skys the limit
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you
PurplePillDebate,removed,facebook is not real life once againare you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah uh let us know when you and ubuttlollipop are done circlejerking
PurplePillDebate,removed,nailed it
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre crazy is the wrong word hysterical histrionic is that it
PurplePillDebate,removed,thanks for the warning
PurplePillDebate,removed,absolutely you caught it she lacks selfawareness
PurplePillDebate,removed,excellent post
PurplePillDebate,removed,so in your opinion there is no possibility that women dress that way because they want to and why do they want to dress that way why does it make them feel good because their lizard brain rewards them when they look attractive and why does it do that so that they get fucked and breed i wont even comment on the rest of your post the sole fact that you equate male and female sexuality means youre not even qualified to post on this sub
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree you are the opposite of red pill that means you live in a delusion and you are brainwashed that is the essence of blue pill that is what red pill men mean whe we say blue pill it is out phrase not yours we get to define it
PurplePillDebate,removed,it was obtuse rhetorical sarcasm pointing out that you failed to prove your argument it wasnt an actual invitation
PurplePillDebate,removed,cute strawman you really dont have any idea what youre arguing against do you is it your past self
PurplePillDebate,removed,most redpill posts here are more about keeping frame and shout outs to each other rather than actually debating anyone coming from you thats priceless
PurplePillDebate,removed,what amuses me is that often times when i challenge red pill shits the argument spirals into cultural relativism the whole how dare you judge me on what basis can you say that is wrong shit as much as you guys complain about feminists and their irrationality i have never run into as much defense with cultural relativism than i have in this fucking sub from red pill shits idk maybe that defense might work against your run of the mill liberal ie framing as the op says but to those of us who actually have confidence in our notions you look like chickens without heads
PurplePillDebate,removed,the other day i had a blue piller telling me that the bad experiences a man has in relationships that set him on the path to trp are because they are not emotionally intelligent enough to engage in a relationship of mutual trust if that isnt victim blaming then it is just plain insulting
PurplePillDebate,removed,i made the analogy that trp was a defensive drivers course for relationships a blue pill response was that trpers slash other peoples tires what are you going to do so yes i certainly think there is a large element of trp members who are twice shy after being bitten or simply observing all the other bite victims the sexual strategy that developed out of that attracts incels players and wannabes because it is effective those types can take things far too literally while the guys who got burned badly can take an extreme position on various points exhibiting dark triad traits attracts women but trying to be dark triad is not something one should be aspiring towards
PurplePillDebate,removed,a lot are around really if i had a yo son right now i would be encouraging him to meet yo community college girls in middle class counties no strategy is infallible of course but being one of the few men who understand the playing field will help
PurplePillDebate,removed,add to the fact that theres like as many fit women thanks to mcdonalds and the fat acceptance movement and we have ourselves a serious shortage of attractive marriagable women
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive seen the study on high n count women didnt know it was the average woman slutting it up however i have heard guys complain that the average woman aims for men outside her league and only settles for an average guy when she gets oldercant get higher quality men interested in her anymore a comedian once said the reason wives treat their husbands poorly is because they were not her first choice women dont talk openly about it you will probably get a ton of denial from women blue pillers and feminists if high n count women are bad news for marriage and the average woman is indeed racking up a high n count then the average guy has few options indeed if he cannot secure an attractive low count woman or an average low n count one it is not worth the emotional and financial turmoil to marry the high n count woman if it means there is a greater chance of divorce divorce is in her favour by default anyone who says the number of partners doesnt matter either has a high n count is being narrowminded or blatantly doesnt care about the risks men take it is easy to shame men for not committing when women are not the ones facing the same risks lets not forget they start crying about where all the good men have gone the closer they are to and want to settle down but also when the high quality men are gone some women are smart they dont give into their impulses as easily they understand there is a limited time to attract the right man and getting a high quality man to commit takes work the rest somehow think the party will go on indefinitely then want to blame society men when they begin to suffer the consequences of their poor choices
PurplePillDebate,removed,it makes sense lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is the problem tottalizign ideolgies listen dude stop with your black and white aspie thinking i know that seperating the world i not alfalfa fux and beta cux make the world nice and simple but thats not how life works life is nuanced and that view of the world is not going to help you long term
PurplePillDebate,removed,be that as it may it still doesnt look like rape also she puked after they had finished plus you dont have to be particularly drunk to vomit from alcohol we dont even know if it was the alcohol that caused her to vomit are you a rapist too
PurplePillDebate,removed,so as shes enthiaslaitycc gigivng me a blowjob and i have to to say to babe do i have your continuous consent for me to blow my load all over your face clearly consent in implied by the fact that shes already sucking my dick dont be a fucking troll dude you gotta read more carefully before overreacting if shes already blowing you you dont have to keep asking for consent if shes blowing you starts gagging on your cock tries to pull her head away and says hey can we take a break or youre too forceful or stop youre making me gag then consent is gone and you have to stop these are clearly very different situations its like youre erasing her words and her opinion from the equation because the situations are completely different unless you ignore the fact she has free will the key part is not continually asking her but to fucking stop if she changes her mind and tells you to fucking stop is that so difficult to understand he doesnt need to be hearing yes im consenting through the whole deed he just needs to listen if she ever says stop changed my mind
PurplePillDebate,removed,you can however revoke consent while the deed is taking place have you ever bothered to think about what a stupid and meaningless statement you just made how is it even theoretically possible to prove in a court of law that one thrust was legal and another was not you people really need to have your heads examined
PurplePillDebate,removed,jesus youre actually retarded
PurplePillDebate,removed,some funny comments in that thread rejection is part of life it sucks but everyone women especially included go through it especially
PurplePillDebate,removed,most people tend to rationalize their life i hope most trpers dont actually believe in what you say if you live in real world you know that women are shallow cunts as much men are shallow pigs thats just something even here you shouldnt say in another thread some women urge men to stop deshumanize women and learn to know them more i am here more i see all of our discussion turning around the power play of dating women get away more easily being shallow because they have the sexual power and men get jealouse of it
PurplePillDebate,removed,women only want equality in things that favor men they dont seem to complain about the special treatment they get in society in a truly equal society women would actually have to face actual consequences for their outrageous behaviour if a woman yells at or hits a man hed be able to do the same back and not have to worry about being the only one going to jail despite all the tough talk done by feminists i really dont think most women would like the outcome of true equality between the genders
PurplePillDebate,removed,thx
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is a tale as old as time women want to believe that the mere fact that they are human and have a personality slightly different than that of other humans makes them interesting and special men have been pretending women are special and interesting to get laid since the beginning of time this isnt some red pill blue pill gender dynamics thing this is just talking to girls
PurplePillDebate,removed,welcome to gay sex prison america and canada uk etc
PurplePillDebate,removed,i guess the only way to argue this would be that is more of a feminist approach than women in general many women want equality or special treatment plus traditional obligations in conservative communities its really only feminists who invariably fight for equal rights and reduced obligationspenalties
PurplePillDebate,removed,dehumanizing destroys a mans confidence and sexuality suck it up buttercup women do nothing men do this to themselves
PurplePillDebate,removed,irrelevant to you but then youre just as irrelevant so it all evens out
PurplePillDebate,removed,what if he says stop and she keeps going is that rape youre a lunatic
PurplePillDebate,removed,in ulewiscross world scrooge kicks the shit out of tiny tim to show him how a real redpill alpha male™ rolls and then gets pumps and dumps his postwall mom
PurplePillDebate,removed,i thought i made it clear you decided to lecture me without the slightest clue what you were babbling on about now were going to examine what brought you down to that level normally a sense of shame would have protected you did you misplace yours
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre too lazy to read detail but still want to bitch about it
PurplePillDebate,removed,no its accurate you are bitching and you yourself are saying youre too lazy to read what you asked for
PurplePillDebate,removed,the question would be rephrased as what do you like about the fact that youre a woman as opposed to a man for pedants like you
PurplePillDebate,removed,pm the link to me too
PurplePillDebate,removed,for starters the scientific method is close to impossible to use when the measurement is self reporting human beings in this case they looked at correlation between divorce rates with partners prior to marriage so the measurement was an action and not claims by lying human beings second this theory is the subject of a peer reviewed paper by teachman that has been discussed to death on this sub thousands of times so take that lying cute act and
PurplePillDebate,removed,you can google as well as i maybe you should also google for statistical inference any other bromide you care to try might just stick as to cute i was just being nice to your bp self know all the tactics your ilk try not that different from the standard hamstering of a cornered female
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey tell that to the country theyre trying to save believe it or not some of us just get the urge to kill violent brown people
PurplePillDebate,removed,how does one find out what another persons n count is does it not occur to these guys that lots of people dont tell the truth about their sexual activites some of these guys are stuck in the high school mentality of keeping track of everyone elses scores as compared to their own they were lying back then too i lost my virginity not long after high school graduation when i told him that i was a virgin i had two prior boyfriends one rather st and one lt but didnt have sex with either he seemed shocked apprently according to the rumor mill not only did both exes claim to have had sex with me at least half a dozen other guys had claimed theyd fucked me too so if your prepared to make a lifelong decision based on something problem routinely lie about then good luck to you hope you find one of the honest ones
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh come on rebecca lawyer put on your thinking cap and review reasonable inference and your namesake in hebrew means to bind or trap or ensnare so maybe you want to think that you have no trouble pairbonding
PurplePillDebate,removed,because alpha cock is the opiate of the female masses duh
PurplePillDebate,removed,now your just going full retard
PurplePillDebate,removed,there are no cogent explanations to give because feminism is not a cogent thought system its happy with selfcontradiction and always will be
PurplePillDebate,removed,pm me please
PurplePillDebate,removed,yea im picturing someone with rabies at their keyboard
PurplePillDebate,removed,agreed when women have low n and the sex is bad we just assumed all sex was bad and that sex wasnt a fun thing we didnt need chad as a comparison
PurplePillDebate,removed,post your picture here we will tell you the truth
PurplePillDebate,removed,k firstly if you hang in circles where people are bragging about beating up pussy then you are trash and so are your friends secondly if youre so insecure that the thought of your woman having a dick that isnt yours freaks you out then you are a little boy not a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,confirmed only people who are red pill are red necks ignorant uneducated backwoods trash who dont deserve to breathe let alone breed
PurplePillDebate,removed,men are women are different is the most pointless response on this sub how about actually making a point
PurplePillDebate,removed,obvious shitpost is obvious
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is a very insightful write up i never studied feminism in depth beyond the required reading that made its way into college english and mosaic classes i always saw a lot of parallels between trp and what i assumed to be radical feminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,a match made in hell also some radfems are into political lesbianism and some terps are in closets
PurplePillDebate,removed,have you read the rules specifically rule
PurplePillDebate,removed,the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world happy wife happy life ladies first im oppressed by simple household chores that i perform for the family i supposedly love at my own pace in my own fashion my husband who works in a mine getting black lung hours a day is the oppressor
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are you gay
PurplePillDebate,removed,uatlasbshruggin do you have anything to say to this
PurplePillDebate,removed,you lucky bastard i would pay a million dollars if i could only make myself homosexual or a passable trans
PurplePillDebate,removed,beats the hell out of me feminists be like men should be free to express their emotions weakness and vulnerability then you have all them sipping from a male tears cup i guess its because they dont want to subvert the core principle of feminism womens issues should always be prioritized regardless of any other circumstances so men expousing their gender specific issues are seen as trying to rob women of their victimhood spotlight
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think its partially a shit test in real life the successful guys are the ones who havent foldedtried sucking up the male feminists are mostly single and the attached ones ive seen are all in poly relationships
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists dont really believe in that bs they give it plenty of lip service but once their man has that moment of weakness and vulnerability they lose all respect for him and wonder how they could have ever been attracted to such a loser in the first place
PurplePillDebate,removed,because no feminist believes its okay to be only weak
PurplePillDebate,removed,the thing with tbp is that they presuppose anything tagged with rp must be bad
PurplePillDebate,removed,simple actually get more masculine masculinity has many forms strength height confidence intelligence wealth status acquire those and you are good to go men do not choose women women choose the men you cant make someone love you just because you like them but you can change yourself to become something they like
PurplePillDebate,removed,see that part where it says notable exception it means for the most part women werent allowed in guilds the notable exception part was commenting on the fact that a woman was not just a member but the guildmaster you dolt in other trades the best legal loophole was if a womans husband died which ive been saying all along i like how you didnt even try to go with your first example that of the female blacksmith probably because that was total fucking bullshit somebody clearly didnt bother to read the link which mentioned armorer among female professions in the paris guild records which is exactly what i fucking said in the first place no i did note the part it was extremely common for women to learn their mans profession as the guild system in europe allowed a woman to take over her husbands business in order to provide for children upon his death i said that you on the other hand denied that women had ever worked in the middle ages
PurplePillDebate,removed,coz chinese girls have weird titties and sideways vaginas dont they
PurplePillDebate,removed,looks like you have successfully minmaxed your life you play a lot of video games dont you
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not that attracted to asian women most of the ones i come across have really thin bodies the facial appearance of a year old and believe it or notcome off as a little too submissive for my tastes
PurplePillDebate,removed,which i answered you answered wrong the scythians did not do what you said women did not traditionally go out and work and men traditionally did not stay home and take care of kids because youve changed the conditions an ancient or not you didnt specify modern regardless your answer is incorrect for both ancient or modern but before you said that jobs in the middle ages where nothing like jobs today so even if i do answer that youll reject it anyway and i never claimed that you said that women were educated and went out to find employment similar to how men and women today do maybe thats because youre full of shit and you cant fucking answer because you pulled this women had jobs in the middle ages shit out of your ass given my mentioning of it before i thought youd be smart enough for me to not have to say it the guild didnt educate women if you disagree feel free to find me some proof that guilds would routinely teach women how to read history to do math etc thats why i didint mention it because its fucking irrelevant the guild was not a school kindly find me a school or institution of learning that even admitted women in the middle ages or go the fuck home my mentioning of guilds etc was show that homemaker was not the only job available to women i have conclusively done that so lets close that part and shift back to the original contention prove to me with sources that women are discriminatedpressured against going into higher educationstem and lets use america as an example or the uk if youd prefer you said women went out to work and had to be educated in order to get said work similar to how they were today you did not say homemaker was not the only job available to women you are the one changing the goalposts now now please stop trying to delaying and tell me which university in the middle ages accepted women do this or get the fuck out
PurplePillDebate,removed,why the hell would guys not be looking here to actually be that successful there you have to be suitable for the culturestyle of living there to have a successful marriage there you have to be what women there want not what women here want but over there or whatever you want to be whatever you want to be sadly wont give you any success anywhere if it doesnt happen to be in line with what other people want you to be if everything lines up for you then more power to you have you married a thin asian woman under yet
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is this blog post
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a total bpd arent you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yep bpd confirmed
PurplePillDebate,removed,speaking of which have i sure met my share of extremely whitewashed middleaged asianamerican women with bitter and nasty dispositions to rival that of anything ive ever come across from the female half of the human race regardless of color i mean bitter bitter all you white guys need to stop with the pumping and dumping of this group segment of the wider population youre crushing a lot of souls who expected the dashing blueeyed devil to actually offer serious commitment up to and including matrimony
PurplePillDebate,removed,your problem is that you are listening to anything feminists say who cares what they say who cares what the low value bottom of the barrel masculine women that make up feminism have to say feminism is just a shit test none of it is based on logic or truth and this part of feminism is just women attempting to figure out which guys to fuck fail the shit test and they know youre unfuckable
PurplePillDebate,removed,because awalt no race or culture matters because female nature triumphs everything and theyll always find a way to be hypergamous
PurplePillDebate,removed,im also in asia there is something about a shared western culture i do miss with asian girl often time it can be hard to smalltalk because you have to explain everything from adam and eve an expression they wouldnt understand since they dont know who adam eve were theres just something relaxed backforth that western girls have that is hard to find with asians they have other things but it is a trade off
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists are all for that until a man starts crying about things that are out of the bounds of their narrative the second his genuine feelings are things they dont want to hear him say he gets labeled a nice guy a guy may genuinely feel like life isnt fair because the women he likes dont want to date him but hes not allowed to complain about it according to feminists and the majority of women in general
PurplePillDebate,removed,check my argument in my history he refuses to debate honestly constantly shifts goal posts and is either not readingimmediately forgetting my comments or is outright lying
PurplePillDebate,removed,am i doing it wrong very
PurplePillDebate,removed,but but true love the one the one who will love me for what i am
PurplePillDebate,removed,enjoy your autism
PurplePillDebate,removed,is it because i called mockery estrogenic or is because of the guy bypassing the no downvote system and calling people autistic
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have a friend of a friend of a friend who is the top cosmetic surgeon in china who deals with eyes it makes me think of that guy in blade runner i only do eyes anyways i turn this year and the fuck of it is this i generally pass for a dozen years younger if i really hit the gym as per trp that would cut another years off of my perceived age but if i could deal with the bags and crows feet about my eyes that would be another years or so maybe more is the new i cant say however i am trying to lock down a unicorn who is and if that doesnt play out i have some other on my table
PurplePillDebate,removed,i swear bluepillers are autistic either that or pedantic trolls or just plain lacking in common sense everyone tries to increase their smv is the logical endpoint for every one wanting to be attractive to get plastic surgery is the logical endpoint for anyone wanting to be good at sports to do drugs no most people decide they have a bit of common sense thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,preselection is sooooo real female solipsism will prevent them from being able to recognize it so take advantage of it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree with the op men these days bring absolutely nothing to the table
PurplePillDebate,removed,keep hamstering brah super beta of you

PurplePillDebate,removed,women arent investments women clap man im leaving you after years of dating women but what about all that time i invested you wasted my time
PurplePillDebate,removed,define decent sometimes means more than of the time but less than of the time no my op clearly states what the point of the cmv is the point of the cmv is to show how catcalling is not objectively immoral so feminists should stop imposing their morals on me by telling me to not do it the point of the cmv is to show how feminists are hypocrites for saying that im responsible for other men who catcall but that women arent responsible for other women that respond positively to catcalling the point of the cmv is that i am not responsible for the actions of other people and i am not to blame for choosing to stay out of it i disagree with your opinion that the only people who catcall are people who cant escalate in any other manner
PurplePillDebate,removed,what about things that arent legally achieved but socially achieved for example things like slut shaming women or expecting men to have to not show emotion

PurplePillDebate,removed,lol nope ive been in multiple relationships with women even loved or but i was never really physically attracted to any of them i always have to settle since im not chad and below average women can totally knock it out of the park in getting a much more attractive guy that guy isnt going to be her bf but its at least something and im talking suicide i would never rape anyone its deplorable suicide on the other hand seems like a great option to stop the suffering
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre just brainwashed by the cult thats why youre so quick to white knight and defend it
PurplePillDebate,removed,if a woman has had or has known people who have had bad experiences with alphas and the cc then she has every right to be shitty that does not mean though that her whole personality is shitty also it seems like this post was just an excuse for you to bitch about your bad college experiences leading yourself to a lifetime of resentment and petty jealousy
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you know him personally what does it matter to you i see a mixture of anger spewing irony and wishful thinking all i see is misogyny and sexism
PurplePillDebate,removed,the blue pill does not have an ideology the only thing they do is make fun of terpers right right
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre either a shit troll or mentally ill cant quite tell oh i get it because a woman is saying whats on her mind thats mental illness stop reading trp and go outside you asshole terp
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck you today i just found out my husband started reading trp and began spinning plates he calls his feeeemales a fucking plate how worse can it be
PurplePillDebate,removed,what a woman notices first is a mans looks and then her childlike female brain decides right then and there whether or not to build a life around him seeking to unbrainwash men that women are attracted to confidence a great personality game humour etc lord knows they wont improve your social status any but sure pair bonding is a myth and you have a wonderful inner beauty anyway any feedback or butthurt coping mechanisms are appreciated no youve got the latter handled just fine i think
PurplePillDebate,removed,i disagree i think there are states of beauty from ugly to super hot
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats bullshit its okay ive come to expect that from you
PurplePillDebate,removed,all fat
PurplePillDebate,removed,what a load of insane leftist crap that ignores reality completely what we are attracted to at a base level is entirely objective traits that signal high levels of fertility in your examples you are confusing high status with attractive perhaps because you are a girl so you are attracted to status but guys are not girls guys are attracted to youth and beauty and high fertility the obese person would not survive a famine the non obese strong people would kill her and eat her being fat is a sign of poor character it demonstrates shitty impulse control and literally shows a low iq when you see a fat person you know that they lack discipline and are going to be ineffective in their lives you know that they have a low iq and so will believe nonsense like you just posted or believe fat logic like they have no control over their fatness is all just magic genetics you know that they will suffer health problems they are also painful to look at there are sooooo many reasons that fat people are unattractive and no there is no amount of evil psychotic emotional abuse you can put little boys through that will change the world so you arent an ugly loser without having to do some work on yourself what a sick thing to even think of what kind of sick person would think oh hey guys arent attracted to my fatness so im going to try to emotionally abuse and brainwash little boys into finding girls like me attractive this is much better than just losing some god damn weight typical leftist thinking which also further demonstrates your poor character
PurplePillDebate,removed,this has been adorable to watch whatever you say bud
PurplePillDebate,removed,is simply stating your beliefs what constitutes an argument these days
PurplePillDebate,removed,you said religious people have weird morals and sexual hangups is simply stating your beliefs what constitutes an argument these days
PurplePillDebate,removed,you seem rather upset at there being no evidence to support your belief in the mythical split do you feel like if only you could confound the mean ol feminists pointing out reality that would in some way provide support for your beliefs
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats not how it works little buddy your needing to provide evidence to support your claims isnt contingent on my jumping through hoops to please you so my refusal to waste my time doing what you order me to doesnt absolve you of the responsibility to provide sources to support your claims
PurplePillDebate,removed,sorry that wasnt coherent enough to really parse i guess you dislike the scientific method because muh uncertainty
PurplePillDebate,removed,lols just being honest with you if you want people to accept your credibility youll have to express yourself in a credible way
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you so inane as to not realize youve contradicted your own question everyone is beautiful in their own way how the fuck would you expect some men to think women are beautiful this would require various interpretations of beauty ie beautiful in their own way there can be no disagreement on beauty unless people are considered beautiful in their own way oh my fucking god lol i feel like im analyzing an year olds ability to reason
PurplePillDebate,removed,ahh a sensitive effeminate male is that a personal attack or merely an observation youve contradicted your own question everyone is beautiful in their own way how the would you expect some men to think women are beautiful unless beauty is somehow relative to the observers preferences this would require various interpretations of beauty ie beautiful in their own way there can be no disagreement on beauty unless people are considered beautiful in their own way and then you went on to say its a binary yeah but this is not the case its just part of it there is a standard of beauty but it is relative to society culture the most beautiful depends on what is accepted widely as beauty and this changes throughout time and across cultures at the same time those who are not the most beautiful are not simply ugly theyre on a spectrum imagine this there is the one most beautiful person on the planet according to you everyone else is ugly unless they are equivalently beauty to this one most beautiful person ie people are either maximally beautiful or maximally ugly which is just dumb i dont think you understand what binary actually implies
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol gavinok is here to tell other people that theyve misunderstood and misrepresented things all hail gavinok the wise s lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant tell if i should laugh at you or pity you
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol reporting comments what does this demonstrate to you workout ahhh you must mean workout those elementary school hallguard privileges
PurplePillDebate,removed,mmhm
PurplePillDebate,removed,because i dont conform to the masculine norm of being tall i have failed as a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre using one now though poorly
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow thats a whole lot of writing just to say i dont like the social sciences because their findings hurt my feelings
PurplePillDebate,removed,it sounds like you have small titties but a face for on the radio all these women are attractive regardless of their breast size
PurplePillDebate,removed,but what if they are shorter than average then they might just as well cut their wrists and give up on life
PurplePillDebate,removed,stay mad phaggot
PurplePillDebate,removed,more niceguy hate stay on topic give me specifics on what he should do dont just spew more hate
PurplePillDebate,removed,plenty of your ilk oh fuck off with that haha ive never seen anyone feminist or not say that a man telling someone else that theyre hurting him when they are is sexist or misogynist get some new sources
PurplePillDebate,removed,hiiiii pemfagbaylis
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you antsocial you come across as a bit cold
PurplePillDebate,removed,how high up are you on the spectrum
PurplePillDebate,removed,the biggest thing stems from frustration over lack of success with women men with any back story can be unattractive coupled with a external locus of control compelling them to seek an outside explanation for their failure
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp is one extreme of the bell curve they are the lowest rung of the smp trying to figure out why nothing works for them
PurplePillDebate,removed,bang on the money with that analysis the sexually marginalized and outsiders turn to trp for advice average semisuccessful joes wont dig through trps bullshit for the nuggets of gold there
PurplePillDebate,removed,karl and adolf are sitting on opposite sides of that centre line
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes a trump supporter
PurplePillDebate,removed,red pillers cant fall in love they are too manly for that
PurplePillDebate,removed,yup my current lover of years is also my best friend i met him at my local hobby stores dd game and we started going to movies hanging out with mutual friends having dinners together yknow friend stuff two years later we began having sex in addition to being best friends we share everything seen each other cry know our flaws and good traits have excellent sex very good communicationi cherish him as both a sex partner and friend
PurplePillDebate,removed,and there you go again atlas cant argue your point without resorting to a strawman except this time you messed up and used a strawman for a point i didnt even make how very unintelligent of you
PurplePillDebate,removed,straw man noun a sham argument set up to be defeated your argument is a secret right there is your strawman i know what the word means you apparently dont and just want to personally harass me you keep proving me correct though
PurplePillDebate,removed,those are usually described as jokes after my points have been made jeeze there are some seriously autistic people on the internet 🙄
PurplePillDebate,removed,my comments never get deleted except for those days ago the least time you tried to pull this shit your lack of selfawareness is astounding but not unexpected
PurplePillDebate,removed,good stop blowing up my phone and go get hammered
PurplePillDebate,removed,every single relationship except one if youre lucky ends the same way someone has a bad track record
PurplePillDebate,removed,i thought you actually had to have some content in an op post or the mods deleted you i had one that was deleted because it only had lines oh and what was the question if im in a relationship and the guy hits me should i believe all men are like that and start hating men in general yours is a dumb beeinthebonnet question
PurplePillDebate,removed,lots of women dont want marriage its outdated and means little nowadays
PurplePillDebate,removed,damn good question
PurplePillDebate,removed,these bloops get hell cranky when they are called out lol did any even answer the question all i have read so far is this is stupid followed by a dummy spit too funny well done op
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah
PurplePillDebate,removed,as opposed to your normal ass surprise law student different people want different things in life despite that surface levelass jump to conclusions on biologically hardwired gender roles
PurplePillDebate,removed,good god your fucking dense because her living alone vs cohabiting is still less money
PurplePillDebate,removed,did your husband cheat on you
PurplePillDebate,removed,theres no more negotiation none this deferential deterrence bullshit no its time to start punishing people heads need to roll
PurplePillDebate,removed,you have to ask them but my understanding is that the divorce rate is high for a reason what do you call a high rate i think it is less than the usually touted there are a lot of various that could lead to miscalculation we do know that then previously and that if a couple can get past they are more likley to not divorce funny how trps philosophy could be based on a false statistic too many dead bedrooms so what is the stat of dead bedrooms to nondead bedrooms oh and the stat of dead bedrooms where the woman has lost desire vs the man and where loss of sexual desire and falling out of love for the spouse is the reason vs other reasons find those stats and then talk about too many dead bedrooms where there is a loss of sexual desire from the wife so everything that youve stated is base on bullshit statistics and assumptions that you pulled from your butt
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sorry you pulling bullshit on top of bullshit here you are going to pull the you cant know my personal experiences card but everything you say is so contradictory its entirely unplausable you think you are a special snowflake but really i think you just have a shockingly low level of introspection
PurplePillDebate,removed,woman wants top men more news at
PurplePillDebate,removed,congratulations you get charm wit andoh yeah sex terrifies you now thanks to all the cheery memories flight or fight theres other fun to be had in here but this really isnt a good place to share is it but tell me when you can close your eyes and you can just dream of anything anywhere all the while still awake why would you ever for anything in the world give that up sex is a poor substitute
PurplePillDebate,removed,misandry is the new equality
PurplePillDebate,removed,so brave
PurplePillDebate,removed,i see this a lot i understand that rp is about sexual strategy but a lot of the questionsposts in here are about relationships sex is a huge part of a relationship but its not the only piece of the puzzle some people want a brainy partner some want a person who shares their interests and yes some just want a hot piece of ass for a debatediscussion sub its a little disheartening how many people are so thoroughly convinced that the way they see relationships is the only way they can possibly work
PurplePillDebate,removed,they need feminism so they can abolish the red pill that was created as a response to feminism because feminism doesnt like the red pill feminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree this seems to feed a complete denial that there are alpha qualities outside of physical attractiveness that can elicit or sustain sexual interest for men in women alpha qualities are those that build or represent power when your partner is worthy of admiration for his capacity to influence the world according to his vision that itself can form the basis of sexual attraction a woman who finds nerdy guys sexually attractive isnt saying that she finds social awkwardness attractive shes saying that she finds intelligence and insight attractive she can see how those things create and sustain power and are worthy of admiration and she finds it exciting
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is the problem we havent been banned yet
PurplePillDebate,removed,stay blue baby
PurplePillDebate,removed,niceness turns off women they want to be dominated and treated like scum
PurplePillDebate,removed,were i this dude id just tell my wife straight up listen my dicks going in your holes tonight you can put up a fight and have it be rape or you can make your peace and try to enjoy it make a choice either she leaves you and you have your answer or she doesnt and you get sex every night win win
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is actually a golden comment on that post from her point of view the problem is not that she doesnt want to have sex but that you do thats the problem she would like to solve she has no interest in working on your problem
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes but it will be with a high beta a beta bucks these guys make the best providers and fathers she will probably cheat or leave but still has kids with mid level or high level betas i am talking about omegas gammas trilamdas haha an upvote for anyone who gets this reference women do not mate with the disabled the steve urkells the milhouses the bottom the only chance these poor guys have is to become uber beta bucks they need to be seriously rich not just a provider or they can go hardcore red pill bottom are invisible and repulsive to women bottom of women also have it rough but not quite as rough due to the hordes of thristy men out there
PurplePillDebate,removed,eh wrong im very much attracted to my partner we havent had sex in quite some time first it was id just had heart surgery now its i just feel decidedly unsexy with this giant red angry scar on my chest it has nothing to do with him and everything to do with me dont be so fucking narrow minded
PurplePillDebate,removed,women want to fuck dominant men not the pussywhipped cucks that our feminist society has created
PurplePillDebate,removed,insert red pill comic about this
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant construct a single coherent argument the only way your undergrad is in philosophy is if youve suffered massive head trauma
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes
PurplePillDebate,removed,no
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats not a real plight that deserves compassion you need to just grow up
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,complain complain complain yawwwwwn
PurplePillDebate,removed,get this through your thick skull we dont give a shit about relashionships fuck your commitment compatibility and diversions were interested in casual sex period a man getting casual sex is lightyears ahead of a punk that has to struggle like a dancing monkey to get a girlfriend and then hope to get rewarded by sex times more mediocre than what she used to do to her fuckbuddy for free if girls were fucking their boyfriend thinking theyre their best we wouldnt be having this discussion
PurplePillDebate,removed,its okay dude use this as just another example of awalt just another hypergamous bitch projecting plain and simple if you complain or show weakness in front of any woman they will be disgusted by you confide in your male friends when you have problems if you dont leave yourself vulnerable and open to women you wont be cut by them
PurplePillDebate,removed,try finding something worthwhile or at least accurate to say it seems scary but i promise it will be okay
PurplePillDebate,removed,its likely men in the future will still have testicles so the scourge of manspreading the greatest plight faced by modern women under the patriarchy will never truly disappear
PurplePillDebate,removed,but if it goes down like this the state will be stronger than engsoz interesting that you picked the german word for ingsoc ôó
PurplePillDebate,removed,any man who is so insecure he must control what professionals i hire has major major issues id never marry such a man when i was young and stupid i dated a guy who tried to control who i associated with if he thought i might be attracted to them a less nice way of describing this was control freak it never occurred to me to cheat on him in time tensions built up and his controlling turned into anger which turned into tantrums when the tantrums turned into violence a friend of mine saw it and called security removing him from me for a few days my girl friends concern was the wake up call i needed i truly believe the next step would be him turning violent on me
PurplePillDebate,removed,so universal relativism aka specialsnowflakeism
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol concerning
PurplePillDebate,removed,i would get arrested for public indecency and endangerment of animals i would be the one dialing
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is times more relevant in this particular sub but it just goes to show you the type of people that would make a thread like this are those who looove to make themselves the victim ironic that in attempting to inject nuance into a discussion about feminism they instead merely trotted out one of the most common tropes associated with the movement
PurplePillDebate,removed,theres a girl that literally fucked dudes in hours three of her male housematesme excluded she offered but the idea of her being stuffed glued shut within minutes of talking to me made me ill she was entering a masters program at berkeley for psychology she wasnt extremely intelligent considering whenever her teachers brought philosophers of mind shed always ask me as a consultation she was outgoing academically successful but not someone id peg as having good judgment she was drunkly raped by a dude she trusted a while i was reading voltaire came to me with tears in her eyes with regret i didnt hangout with her really hence didnt give a fuck about her
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre pretty thick if thats your first conclusion shatter that ego abit
PurplePillDebate,removed,whats the point of this post you feel bad because someone called you out on your support of feminism youre whining and complaining pleading with people to be a little more nuanced sometimes this is a shitpost rant theres nothing to debate here other than your hurt feelings and your complaints that people arent sufficiently nuanced
PurplePillDebate,removed,its hard to restrain that conceited arrogance when youre peers are so fucking stupid dysfunctional
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont work with single men or meet lone men at properties wow that is pathetic you are actually compromising your own future possible income just because you are worried about your husbands fee fees he must be a big baby then who cant handle his jealousy maybe he threatens you or yells at you or did at one point and now you are scared just to be alone with another man of face his jealousy maybe he tells you its your fault he gets jealous because you should know better then to stand in a house with a client its impossible to live and avoid all intersex interaction sounds like your husband wishes that were true
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck balance

PurplePillDebate,removed,the analogy to pluto is nonsensical pluto exists its actually been seen and its existence and behavior are scientifically proven facts fail but thanks for playing
PurplePillDebate,removed,fail
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre useless too
PurplePillDebate,removed,women worship rapists and murderers so this will probably help them even more
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree thats the purpose of the third wave feminism the point the blue pill is simply to harass and shame any man that dares question it
PurplePillDebate,removed,not bp not gonna cmv but youre spot on with the hypocrisies and double standards feminismbluepill presents us with good post cheers

PurplePillDebate,removed,save their money and hire quality hookers
PurplePillDebate,removed,get the fuck outta here psychotic ass fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have to agree this is just too risky the prospects of a rape charge are fairly high at the end of it and you cant even argue consent if you were to record the encounter only someone not at all concerned about the safety of men would push such a concept even if it is actually real for many women utterly irresponsible maybe that is just practical beta tradcon in me talking
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes i think its fucking disgusting enthusiastic consent or nothing stop letting your dick compel you to be an animal
PurplePillDebate,removed,holy shit dude you are a human dumpster fire
PurplePillDebate,removed,hell there are probably more men who believe the earth is flat than agree with your view on women and sex yes most men arent emotionally damaged and dont get off on the idea that women are getting raped
PurplePillDebate,removed,pm me too
PurplePillDebate,removed,they want to buy a nb miata with a lot of miles and dents for cheap because they cant afford a nd miata then they want to justify that the nb miata is every bit as good as a nd by lowering the standards threshold despite the nd is better in every single way besides cost
PurplePillDebate,removed,by todays standards anything is considered rape not to worry though i have never come close and probably never will come close a simple no has me walking in mere seconds trp men should not be needy for sex they should have the fortitude to walk away from a sexual offer if they are not comfortable or interested lack of interest from a woman in any way not even a no just lack of interest should have a trp man walking away he doesnt need sex and certainly less from a woman who doesnt like or want you the mere feeling of needing sex is a weakness it should be fought insistently ive been laid more times by ignoring or flat out refusing sex than i care to count trp is not meant to be lived by it is meant to allow those who have not had an example of what it means to be a man learn the ropes of how relationships work there is no rule saying you must follow it just the knowledge nuclear physicists learn how to make a bomb it doesnt mean every one of them has one in their glove compartment ignoring a womans no is a sign of a weak man if a woman says no to sex after any kind of foreplay she gets a ride home in a cab totally ignored and no sex ever again those are very dangerous games to be played now days as like i said before the definition of rape today is so broad you could look at a woman and be accused of raping her another tactic is that at least with me the woman has to clearly show interest in advancing towards sex before i make any kind of move towards sex i would very much rather have missed an opportunity for sex than to run the risk of overstepping an invisible boundary that is hard to guess at especially nowadays but thinking back i have been this way forever i have never tried to push harder than playful jousting that cannot ever be considered anywhere near rape trp doesnt need sex sex comes with being trp it should not be a goal it should be a perk of being trp
PurplePillDebate,removed,cos its both where they possess an advantage promiscuity and women have a hard time admitting they enjoy sex and its their favourite enjoyable narcissistic vehicle you add to that that men dont like it and theres going to be period pain
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck you i even said that a middle class accountant who isnt sexually experienced probably should marry a women he could never please in bed im just making the point that the woman isnt objectively bad or unworthy of love
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean most people would benefit from coke and hookers every once in a while
PurplePillDebate,removed,because feminists are gynocentric woman is the godempress she is attractive no matter what fat acceptance she is smart and capable no matter what affirmative action she is infallible and perfect
PurplePillDebate,removed,im surprised nobody is really delving into this concept but here it goes women are looking for reasons to disqualify you especially when they dont know you if you say or do the wrong thing you are pretty much disqualified and you will be hard pressed to prove her otherwise my personal thoughts are this if you look strong and confident and then say something fucking weird that turns her off in the middle of a conversation you are essentially making her creep radar go off and all that confidence you had earlier now just looks like false bravado nobody likes a faker and you might be one its the same concept as online dating just in person in online dating they have big fat checklist you have to meet and if you dont they wont even talk to you in regards to an in person connection its the same thing she has an arbitrary checklist in her head of fuckups that shes subconsciously looking for youre just another dude theres gotta be a catch and when she finds it she can hop onto a date with another dude pretty easily especially if youre both higher smv a high smv woman will vet you harder than a low smv woman if youre a high smv man in looks say an shes going to be turned off when youre acting like someone whos never done this before with a woman like her youre acting like a
PurplePillDebate,removed,dude get out of the internet
PurplePillDebate,removed,your alt accoun seems to be used regularly
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a canary its an easy way to get the point across but as many women in here point out most girls have had a few dozen cocks in them by the time they get around to you it helps a guy internalize keeping his eyes open for shitty behavior from a woman if shes hiding her phone from you constantly texting shit or had pig roasts for ten years then avoids bjs because shes not like that anymore theres so many issues that can arise from temporary dickstorage units but the number itself says nothing in isolation
PurplePillDebate,removed,hah
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wouldnt marry a woman that has fucked more than absolute max guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,no offense and i really really mean no offense cause i dont want to insult you but i know what im about to say will be very insulting but in all honestly and seriousness id rather be fucking dead than i seriously hope i die before that
PurplePillDebate,removed,well im hoping to kill myself some time in the next year as soon as i get the balls to do it hopefully will avoid all that shit that comes with very old age
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats a lame criteria we are not in the age of conan stop fantasizing about macho men worship of masculinity is no way to build a society even if it does turn your crank
PurplePillDebate,removed,well i can safely say that you are an awful person no one deserves to be harassed to the point of suicide he no longer being in this world does not make it better yes she cheated on her boyfirend but think of her family her friends and people who relied on her no long getting to see her everyday you see i clearly would not like you if we met you have deplorable ideas about women and sexuality but i would never tell you to kill yourself or celebrate your death i would not think the world would be better if you died i think it would be better if you got the help you needed i honestly wish you the best
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is the second post ive ever made on ppd you dunce
PurplePillDebate,removed,most people arent aware that incels even exist if anything yall should be pulling more ers right now chads and women are content to simply ignore your existence and let you suffer whenever they do notice you they heap even more torment and mockery onto you what solution do you have other than to share your suffering with others so they finally understand
PurplePillDebate,removed,sarcasm is the lowest form of whit disphit nice rebuttal
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah and go pick on the other commenters too if you care so much about minor insults im willing to bet you dont even know what dunce means but ill let it slide this time for the sake of avoiding having to continue this miserable conversation just remember when youre trusted by the community to mod a large community youre expected to be fair remember that
PurplePillDebate,removed,i actually do have a solution and know what i need to do to fix my problem but im not allowed to mention it here i mentioned it once before and the mod chucked a hissy fit and got her knickers in a knot so ill be quiet this time i know the red pill wont work in cases like mine
PurplePillDebate,removed,like i said you might want to sit this one out since youre really not answering the question and derailing the thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey you grew a penis
PurplePillDebate,removed,omg why is sex so important to you gawd why cant men just be happy pampering and catering to womens incessant demands constantly changing your wifes emotional diaper is totally worth having to swallow your libido and hide your boners so she doesnt feel pressured why do you hate rjustlegbeardthings
PurplePillDebate,removed,genderfluid means they are just the specialist little snowflake and no one gender truly defines them
PurplePillDebate,removed,its like being otherkin its something autistic androgynous morons with a hardon for feminismsocial justice do to be special and get attention
PurplePillDebate,removed,me twerks to the truth amen
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you have to follow someone elses rules when it comes to dating youll never be alpha
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure
PurplePillDebate,removed,mhm
PurplePillDebate,removed,where does redpill advocate kowtowing to every little thing a woman asks of you where does redpill advocate for marrying single mothers to be a real stand up guy you have your terms confused intentionally i suspect but youre a bloop so youre only going to be posting satire and humor not substantive arguments
PurplePillDebate,removed,watch the rpers come in with the rule saying most women have big dicked chads as partners
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh please sir may i touch you you are so awesome with all your humblebrag
PurplePillDebate,removed,all this might accurately reflect the research but the idea of alpha and beta is valid in terms of male hierarchies and sexual attraction groups of men automatically arrange themselves into hierarchies with one or two alphas at the top and the rest in a descending hierarchy based on skills and abilities some men are more sexually attractive than others and those sexually attractive men have the run of and first pick of the available women leaving leftovers if any to the rest of the men some men are more capable than other men some men are more sexually attractive than other men some men are more socially adept than other men those more capable more sexually attractive men are alphas while less capable less sexually attractive less socially adept men are betas or omegas
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats nice we just discussed this trp alpha is not based on alpha wolves so what
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow the womenz seem to have it so hard with marriage maybe they should go on a marriage strike and show those ungrateful men right ladies
PurplePillDebate,removed,yet it seems these poor abused women are the ones who are pushing men into marriage dont get it surely they should have learned from the feminists that marriage is a raw deal where they are literally slaves of men while bringing in most of the damn income women should go on a marriage strike damnit
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont get it there a lot you dont get about women you should probably just leave them alone better for everyone that way
PurplePillDebate,removed,the very idea of divorce rape is comically ironic it is the same kind of hyperbolic language we see trp posters criticise when it comes from uber liberals it is merely applied to a concept they wish to demonise instead consequently it is inherently inaccurate functioning not as a useful descriptor but as a label that can stigmatise behaviour
PurplePillDebate,removed,its largely due to them not being particularly successful and men arent impressed by them too much cost without enough benefit for the men to marry
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you take dailymail serious you got bigger problems
PurplePillDebate,removed,your hypocrisy should make you very proud
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really need someone else to point out the hypocrisy in your statement i have never asked for help from the police for anything ever and i dont help the police do their jobs either i mind my own buisness and deal with my own problems whichever way i can if youre a victim of violent crime cops will try to force information out of you even if you dont wish to press charges when that happens i just say i dont remember anything im not protecting the people that hurt me when i refuse to snitch what im doing is keeping the cops out of my buisness and out of my life
PurplePillDebate,removed,i had his recently as my submissions describe it was a tinder one night stand and she for some reason i dunno she wanted my genetics is all i could think of was dead set on having it despite being a nice intelligent girl i told her not too but she said she had made up her mind and all i could do was sit back and watch god helped me out though as the baby stopped growing at weeks and it was a miscarriage wrap up gents
PurplePillDebate,removed,men shouldnt give a damn about social opinions
PurplePillDebate,removed,female incels wat where
PurplePillDebate,removed,you value the life of a stranger less than a dog lmfao chill out mr bateman
PurplePillDebate,removed,i get that empathy is hard for some people i really do but if you cant even try to spare any sympathy for the pain of others please dont bother asking for any youre every bit as bad as the what about the menz thread derails
PurplePillDebate,removed,its perpetuating toxic masculinity and its further proof that this concept was once again just made to benefit women or to shame men for yet a other thing create problem shame victims dont care about the root of the problem well at least they got another way to shame men why do they think its ok to tell us what its like being a man without even having a penis in what world do they get to decide that i think they are just femsplaining there
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh makes sense nearly all women would rape you thats just normal and this incident points to a larger trend
PurplePillDebate,removed,not just women all people are essentially prostitutes men included definition of prostitution prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations in exchange for payment or some other benefit you cant honestly say that most men wouldnt have sex with someone they found unattractive whether male or female for an amount of money if no one would find out the only question is how much money yes this includes your husband for the right amount of money he would fuck the ugliest woman hes ever seen right in front of you for another amount of money he would allow a big burly man to bend him over and stick his dick up his ass again right in front of you
PurplePillDebate,removed,this was part of the underlying basis of my prediction blue pill posters generally equal nice normal middle class pussies who dont really need their network for anything other like light entertainment
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont let your solipsism make you assume that what applies to you applies to every other woman just as much
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont look for trouble but sometimes the trouble finds you what can you do what can i do what can i do it makes my stomach turn but living here you gotta learn you gotta fight back when someone tries to take your life from you madball

PurplePillDebate,removed,as a feminism just check the following box that most accurately reflects how you see me enslaver rapist murderer salivating boobloving neanderthal
PurplePillDebate,removed,lel
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop just stop youre a woman what the fuck do you know im a man ive talked to thousands of men ive been around thousands of men ive heard the things men say to other men in private that they dont say to women in public do i tell you about what women think no i dont so do me a favor and save it bearing extreme circumstances most guys dont want a chick with a lengthy sexual past the only guys okay with it are desperate dudes happy to have a girlfriend bloopers nuff said and maybe guys whove had sex with so many girls say north of or so girls that they feel like hypocrites for dissing a girl who did the same thing in my years i can say a large majority of men dont want a slut bag for wifey nowive said my peace you can go back to telling us men what men want again
PurplePillDebate,removed,ustatsfodder read this upaperstreetvilla gave me a permaban six months ago for posting haha this guy is pretty much the single reason why the trp sub looks empty now the only one who likes to swing his edick around is him right about now he will probably get really butthurt and try to say that i did something else which i didnt i never trolled or did any stupid shit hes just a random cunt who thinks getting back at women can be achieved by banning every man in sight with thesaurus in hand oh and as a bonus remember on prorevenge yeah that was the bluepilled whiny shirtlifting slimy motherfucker himself somehow that story got him moderator status on trp and well the userbase is now history
PurplePillDebate,removed,landwhales
PurplePillDebate,removed,how is this op not banned oh hes trp got it
PurplePillDebate,removed,okay play stupid then if you still cannot grasp the fact that men can separate sex from datingrelationshipsmarriage after knowing that fucking midget porn is a thing then nothing will get through your dense head who cares what the average age of marriage is most men settle when asked what age of women they are attracted to men were highly inelastic about their preferences highly inelastic
PurplePillDebate,removed,show me what super rich men are doing and almost all of them go for younger women almost implies that not all rich men do it there are exceptions reading comprehension please the overarching trend is that a wide majority of successful men stick to younger women and even the super rich men that dont the older women they marry are still insanely hot inhumanely beautiful i care about what these men do because it shows what men would really choose if they had all the options in the world the fact that men are marrying women that are older but saying they are only attracted to girls in their implies that men are settling the fact that most models movie actresses porn stars are women in their imply that men find these women the most appealing as well if men preferred women in their and they would be plastered all across the media from film to modeling to porn etc theyd be the ones modeling lingerie and doing sexy advertisements theyd be the hot chick in the movies with the action hero get real stop hamstering
PurplePillDebate,removed,gross
PurplePillDebate,removed,pm me
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah autistic people have a hard time understand sarcasm and irony
PurplePillDebate,removed,except for a select lucky few this is not the case women still have to work to support themselves especially since in general people are waiting longer to get married its not common anymore for a woman to get married right out of the home she grew up in to a man who will take care of her for life to the degree that she never has to work why do you choose this fantasy when you know how unrealistic it is yo i just gotta point out it sounds like youre mad at what feminism has undone lmao
PurplePillDebate,removed,well it is true that high dom women want to be dommed by high dom men because ultimately women want to submit to men even the dominant and hysterical man hater want it its also true that many high dom women are uggo as hell
PurplePillDebate,removed,ugh that post was creepy as hell lad no wonder youre having trouble getting laid i think my vagina just retreated further into my body cheers
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey i agree with you oncejulian might have something to say about this but i think youre dead on everything goes back to the metaphysical duality of male and female but since this place isnt really that elevated in terms of casual discussion ill just share a supporting anecdote i find that women really really dont mind ncount with men because a high n count man signals a high value male i also tend to see women naturally forming quasiharems around studs i know of a couple of cases in particular of girls in my hometown that dated a deadbeat dad stud loser who was hypermasculine at first the first girl he had kids with will be very jealous of the new girl he has knocked up but when he gotgets with the girl and impregnates her the other two girls will become sisters who shame him for not taking care of the kids he already has with us this guy becomes the father of multiple children from multiple women my so is a photographer and she recently did a family christmas photoshoot with one of these guys and two of the three women he had kids with and theyre totally cool best friends with eachother by being a complete dick this guy has a harem and a huge family line in order if they dont all become crackheads no guy i know would go for this in a woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre insecure over a woman youre interested ever being with any mangood luck in life
PurplePillDebate,removed,the fuck i used the persons own language lol bloops
PurplePillDebate,removed,i understand the concepts doesnt mean they are intelligent or reasonable cause any philosophy exists that tries to be not intelligent or not reasonable or perhaps you dont understand what theyre saying or theres just a few hundred thousand men circlejerking about idiocy promoting not one but at least two reactionary subreddits to exist and fight this stupid unreasonable philosophy that clearly no one can possibly take seriously if they really knew the concepts being pushed
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre wrong youve always been wrong and always will be
PurplePillDebate,removed,post pics
PurplePillDebate,removed,when men follow women around and do chores for them like little dogs and then complain when those women dont respond by fucking them
PurplePillDebate,removed,friend them really hard lel nice analogy
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol i hate having that feeling theyre like bugs
PurplePillDebate,removed,i fail to see how this passive aggressive question challenges my view
PurplePillDebate,removed,from what ive seen from others and even some personal experience it seems to be fairly common for men to do this especially when they believe the girl is better looking than them like i had a guy that tried to date me neg me even though i was clearly a bit above him and would only date him if i was and lost my looks this man was a fat virgin in his and i was
PurplePillDebate,removed,bad looking men are actually more likely to be abusive
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not just occasional a lot of ugly men will target pretty women and neg them ive had it happen to me plenty times by men uglier than me so have some of my pretty friends literal losers come up to them and say shit to them its strange my friend even had beer poured on her by some loser who she softly rejected
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok men are complete losers so theyre xed the that arent losers one of them just got out a long term relationship and isnt ready to date he likes you but just needs time to get over his ex the other one is nice but youre just not completely vibing there you go
PurplePillDebate,removed,well i do easily find men that are plenty decent and nice looking but still good looking women have to deal with a lot of losers when they go out that say rude shit as some type of pick up game
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre a guy then why would you hear about it i only know about it because of girl talk
PurplePillDebate,removed,well if you think of loser in terms of bmi i have a normal bmi and im pretty to boot so i guess to answer your original dumb q no im not projecting
PurplePillDebate,removed,except its not just one incident its repeated incidents of harassment that make someone feel crappy over time
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah cause theyre not gonna do it when another dude is there they only do it to groups of women or one woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes you can argue its why many marriages end in divorce women end up with low self esteem then they marry men below their league because they think they dont deserve better and then the marriage is shit because shes not happy with a man worse than her so she ends up divorces him
PurplePillDebate,removed,why is it so controversial to say that if a man is fat or ugly and he wants a pretty woman that he has to be hilarious or rich its the truth he needs to make up for his look with other charming qualities
PurplePillDebate,removed,ha i cleaned tar poop out my first babys ass when he was in the nicu followed by tanks of air until he could get enough oxygen on his own dont get me started on my second boy i did far more than my fair share sweetie
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats not what op means xd but your head is backwards so you wouldnt understand
PurplePillDebate,removed,where is my parade of beta orbiters i need money
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok now you sound like a rambling crazy man calm down go wash your face and come back
PurplePillDebate,removed,im bi so i may not understand it correctly stopped reading here everything after thats irrelevant
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are asking where the idea came from i introduced you to the creaters of the idea and showed you why they have it stop being a chode
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop looking for a rage boner youre deliberately trying to reframe the scenario to suggest a ridiculous premise whats wrong with just taking the exact same situation and just swapping the genders anytime one of you retards tries to get cute with these little hypotheticals you just show you assburgerz instead you know damn well there are too many dynamics at play to pretend this sort of thing can be understood in a vacuum tsk tsk i expect more from you uatlasbshruggin
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmfao i feel you have a lot of gay friends and i live in a pride city ive always said being a decent looking straight guy in a gay environment must be a taste of what women live with every day
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont even see a downvote button in this sub is that not true for everyone
PurplePillDebate,removed,fucking awesome this thread badly needed to happen
PurplePillDebate,removed,shes a lawyer she doesnt argue in good faith but rather to win
PurplePillDebate,removed,then apparently youre not an attractive woman or even an average woman because even average women get male attention not nearly as much as hot women but they get some attention
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre not smart enough for this you literally dont understand what even you are saying you are saying as an rp man who therefor emust have read sexual utopia in power and knows what hypergamy is that it would behoove or benefit women or men in any way to settle for men they arent really attracted to or that worse they should approach men who are either too fucked up in th emasculinity department to approach them or are out of their league you are writing the recipe for disaster and for soem reason you dont even see it you are also makign a false distinction between having men who are not options approach you as a woman and having men who are not options approach you as a man a man who is not an option fo ra women is not different than anythign else that is not an option like a dog another woman or a cantaloupe if you ever think im wrong or trolling check your premises dude because im right
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp confirmed
PurplePillDebate,removed,women are property
PurplePillDebate,removed,all the jealousy from angry and lonely men in rp what they fail to recognize is that there are plenty of invisible women out there too and staceys that get followed around everywhere and lots of women in between
PurplePillDebate,removed,what the fuck are you rambling about words are agreed upon concepts to describe a thing present in our environment people can disagree on what specifically constitutes misogyny but hatred of women is a thing and you wanting to earn suck up cool girl points with the alt right neckbeards here doesnt change that
PurplePillDebate,removed,jokes on you ive used all my gfs as nothing more than human fleshlights aswell as house slaves and didnt even have to spend much of my own money to do so 🙄 i guess feminism did help me personally a lil
PurplePillDebate,removed,tall made up for it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was at least you had the chance
PurplePillDebate,removed,it works for me now but being that skinny and that much taller than everybody else at years old worked against me a lot duh who cares about having sex that young anyhow you literally cant go wrong if youre
PurplePillDebate,removed,the world would indeed be better off without redpillers and mgtows who dont really shut up and disappear like they promise to do
PurplePillDebate,removed,im pretty sure shes talking about the kind of man you find on redpillmgtowincel subs that man is toxic filth all right
PurplePillDebate,removed,spin all you want its passive aggressive manipulation then youll extol your rp bullshit in the same breath about how all women are devious manipulators who shouldnt be trusted just say do you mind if we split the bill her response will tell you the same thing youre after which is whether shes ok with spilling the bill and whether she thinks you as the man should pay but youd rather wimp out and play a mental game with her because you cant be upfront about your desires sounds kinda beta maybe you should read the sidebar
PurplePillDebate,removed,get a room you and mr cross
PurplePillDebate,removed,when did i say you were op you fucking nimwit
PurplePillDebate,removed,im slightly frustrated with your autism
PurplePillDebate,removed,god i hate reading your posts all inflammatory for no reason to piss people off
PurplePillDebate,removed,no its not it bothers me that youre acting tough over the internet when we both know youre a timid autistic beta fag in real life
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbp front page tomorrow trp advocates murder of women
PurplePillDebate,removed,you wont
PurplePillDebate,removed,because i know
PurplePillDebate,removed,whatever you sayyyyy
PurplePillDebate,removed,sounds more like sociopathy
PurplePillDebate,removed,i like to go with what works needledick
PurplePillDebate,removed,correct nothing to change here face it we are living in modern jungle we humans are sort of animals ourselves we live to reproduce that is our meaning of life its about looks of course it is always was and always will be now you either wanna live in a fucking fairy tales so you wont get hurt or you accept the truth and move on
PurplePillDebate,removed,the wimpy dude you labeled cutie is what ive always imagined you looking like
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont buy it you know what the word means you just like to be a snowflake
PurplePillDebate,removed,literally nobody grows up misunderstanding the definition of shallow yes maybe atlas was raised by wolves i doubt it
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol calling me out why do you sound like a girl when you post
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes just a white knighting cuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh we both know i wouldnt have to use blackmail on you besides if i aimed the device at you it might get overloaded and explode
PurplePillDebate,removed,no women are given the right to say they do not want to be pregnant it just happens that in most heterosexual partnerships it is the female partner who is pregnant in the case where the couple uses a third party surrogate to carry the child neither individual in the partnership will have the right to ask for an abortion of any kind once the child has been conceived bodily autonomy bullshit i guess it sucks to be a man its interesting how youve turned this whole situation into one that victimized you tho male socialization is a hell of a drug
PurplePillDebate,removed,wouldcouldshould of does not exist what youre thinking of is wouldcouldshouldve a contraction of the word and have please do not use would of could of or should of
PurplePillDebate,removed,dude she said shes discussed sex with women learn to read
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh dont be silly only read the post title
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol killallwomen
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dunno but i do know that your comment like most of trp was so edgy that i cut myself on it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i linked my reasoning for why you have every right to judge it answers your question how does that not fucking relate
PurplePillDebate,removed,be civil remove the last line you can debate with arguments instead of personal attacks
PurplePillDebate,removed,how dumb does she think people are that she promotes this stupid study expecting nobody to notice how the results are fixed
PurplePillDebate,removed,what kind of fucking retard wrote this post lol you guys have probably not seen that case in the uk where a case of sexual harrassment was going on against a guy who shoulder bumped a woman the case went on for one year lol blue pillers pretending that sex is necessary for sexual assault cases
PurplePillDebate,removed,girls need to stop appropriating guy terminology a girl getting plowed by two guys is getting gang banged a guy fucking around with two girls is called a threesome this is very simple stop muddling up our language
PurplePillDebate,removed,one girl getting banged by two guys is a gang bang because a gang of guys is banging her one guy having two girls fawning over him is a threesome in a threesome all three people end up kissing each other for example while in a gang bang one girl ends up getting used by multiple guys as a penis and cum receptacle though for someone who somehow cant understand that men and women are different im sure this is all very confusing i hope my explanation has been able to help you out a bit
PurplePillDebate,removed,yup that is how bpers argue
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh fuck off i dont patronize my clients at all most of them are great people and i interact with them like an equal get it published in a reputable forum and come back to me alsoi have written a book ive taught creative writing at a tertiary level im doing an mfa in it next year im more likely to trust my opinion than that of internet randoms its a touch more qualified
PurplePillDebate,removed,really a woman is a whore if she had a threesome thats ridiculous even if it was with her ex husbandboyfriend thats shitty logic come on now all women are whores they exchange their body for variousness from a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive been in a conversation with pembayliss thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,rekt
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol shots fired
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,someone is having a bad day
PurplePillDebate,removed,how does metareview weaken the data in the original studies
PurplePillDebate,removed,ahahaha youre a plagiarist and youre so thoroughly clueless you dont even aware the reproducibility sneer comes from meta analysis u dumb
PurplePillDebate,removed,look you greedy little goblin and its in this thread and as a different comment considering youve probably not read the abstract or looked into the authors clear bias check his website dont be mad you arent spoonfed granted i only read abstract and a few pages of data but if you saw the paper and you wouldnt either at least his one based on chilean and croatian men was a bit more readable flawed but readable i guarantee this doesnt pass the replication problem in science right now
PurplePillDebate,removed,since almost all of the bullshit rape hysteria false accusations are actually college campus nonsense tribunal cases and not criminal cases how would this help anyone
PurplePillDebate,removed,im a registered nurse why would i care about that own my own home by my own pay why would that make you attractive i went from obese to fit so you are low smv you have shitty genes i went from obese to fit and now take care of my body no kids diseases or health problems and ive been told im hot as fuck i once had a girl tell me some dudes told her they thought she looked so much like angelina jolie this girl was skinny af had no tits and a saggy ass hmm because being this awful towards half the planet because you cant get laid i can get laid but i want to get laid an hour or so after i meet a girl for the first time really focus on why you have such problems and see someone preferably a male therapist you can respect as for the next while you wont be able to respect a womans opinion because im not a model that is my problem as for the next while you wont be able to respect a womans opinion why would i respect you i can knock your teeth out just by slapping you lol i only respect men
PurplePillDebate,removed,repeat buzz words youve heard over and over virtue signaling complete oh goldpilot youre such a good person
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is illegal to file a false report the problem is nobody charges people unless its a seriously malicious incident it would create a bad precedent and keep actual victims from coming forward i do think if it can be proven beyond a doubt that a person filed a false accusation with great malice and premeditation it should be strongly punished all these feminists who now call everything including regret sex rape are really just shooting their own movement in the foot
PurplePillDebate,removed,for crying out loud quit whining
PurplePillDebate,removed,fight me vs snipers only and i will prove to you that alphas are real
PurplePillDebate,removed,who is this tbp person ive never met him
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah atlas is such a low effort troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,well rape is kind of a downside the pickier a girl is the less men shes attracted to and the higher chance she doesnt consent
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont have rape fantasies i just want to cockblock anitapks its so good being a woman girlpower circlejerk i did the same thing to pinkpill misticx
PurplePillDebate,removed,nuh uh theres all sorts of positive masculinity that feminists talk about constantly such as andum not my job to educate you shitlord
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not an attack on blacks its an attack on acting black the progressive lynch mob
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol male tears
PurplePillDebate,removed,youll just get a bunch of replies about how all those men are sex symbols to someone
PurplePillDebate,removed,i used small words just for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,took you a while to reply this time did you have to venture outsidele gasp
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol occasionally i always underestimate how delusional trp is
PurplePillDebate,removed,no i made fun of your point because its delusional
PurplePillDebate,removed,hows mom doing sips
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill debate you later not feeling aggressive now besides ive already figured the female attraction out for myself with the help of others
PurplePillDebate,removed,i also think a lot of boys are taught growing up that their sexuality is inherently threatening girls are shamed for our sexuality too of course but in different ways theres plenty of shame to go around therefore they see any confident assertive display of sexual interest as not being nice and they assume guys displaying those characteristics are assholes very good points thank you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i did contrary to what i expected you didnt post rubbish for once this still doesnt change my assertion niceness comes with behaviors that are adverse go getting laid or produces them also youre treating confidence as something totally disconnected from niceness and assholishness and thats simply wrong people who lack confidence tend to be more agreeable and less assertive people who get laid on the regular who are see my line of reasoning more likely to be jerks tend to be more confident
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre right i agree with you
PurplePillDebate,removed,no of course not less women die from giving birth than men who go to jail or die in the workplace
PurplePillDebate,removed,that your fan fiction requires better character development i can be your beta if you want upvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminism is special treatment of women i understand that you dont have to give a shit about anyones kids so if someones little shits do not benefit me or anyone else why do you think having children is work
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol so the existence of one male pioneer in computing totally negates the existence of all female pioneers in computing right bro charles babbage is not singlehandedly responsible for the entire field tool he kinda is though
PurplePillDebate,removed,i want to do everything in my power to discourage this line of thinking chances are if you read this subreddit are an mgtow style incel are the type to become fixated on dubious dating statistics etc you will not become the type of criminal who gets laid those guys have enormous levels of confidence no fear and run in social circles where casual sex is common with women who are probably troubled themselves are you prepared to start living that way and will that really make you happy
PurplePillDebate,removed,motherhood is commonly described as a career and a job what is your product and who is your buyer or what is your service and who is the client perhaps feminists will start thinking of brushing their teeth as a career and a job next
PurplePillDebate,removed,post pics of your gf and we will judge whether you know what youre talking about or not
PurplePillDebate,removed,women not unlike men enjoy receiving raw sexual attention from their partners and you call em dumb that just doesnt make sense something bothering you buddy cause you seem grumpy
PurplePillDebate,removed,work what work have you shown you write a long rambling internally contradictory post and want me to prove you come in and make a statement with absolutely nothing to back it up show your work or its just your opinion which means jack shit a mans definition of normal is a participative home life where he can relax a womans definition of normal is a train station on a long train journey to the destination of personal wealth and boytoys on which each of her marriages is a relief stop damn i really feel sorry for you what a shitty way to look at life
PurplePillDebate,removed,they all get laid a lot at the local judy garland park mall bathroom or grindr because just like always when men try to post attractive men the all look like buttfucking queers
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol are you mad one thing i think well never be able to drill into a bloopers head is just how hard it is to get laid as a guy who isnt a theyre all majority women and have had to go through the process of start to finish meeting a girl and getting her into your bed eventually if you were a male for a day and i gave you the opportunities to go or and pull heck even if you were an attractive male i guarantee you you would flounder hard then come back to reddit and ask us all why the women treated you so badly you getting laid is a simple task that you can achieve whenever sex is inherent to your body you rarely have to seek it out youre entitled to it we have to earn it
PurplePillDebate,removed,human beings are as diverse as life on this planet for every type there is a countertype there is someone out there for just about everyone damn this is pathetic
PurplePillDebate,removed,no harm no foul
PurplePillDebate,removed,if i was a feminist id say that we should give it some more time and we are still living in a patriarchy and men are still sexist pigs that prefer men
PurplePillDebate,removed,giving neckbeards false hope is pathetic feeding people sweet utopia lies is pathetic telling the truth however harsh it may be i respect
PurplePillDebate,removed,vice is a propaganda machine
PurplePillDebate,removed,obviously first one is a gym addict third one is a beta with oneitis fourth one is a doctor and thus the only one with enough time and nothing else to do but bang chicks is the tattoo guy
PurplePillDebate,removed,the difference between mediocrity and legacy right here folks
PurplePillDebate,removed,so many people are fuckin stupid
PurplePillDebate,removed,no people are attracted to same things and most people compromise the only real purpose of sexual relationships is reproduction saying that different people are attracted to different things sounds nice and inclusive and comfy but its a blatant contradiction with reality we are all animals underneath and we have animal instincts men want feminine features women want masculine features and thats it there are sexual deviations but its not worth talking about
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think feminists are women that could never get a good alpha male to fuck them hard they are butthurt at all men and especially despise weak men despite what they say about equaliteh basically the feminization of men and decreasing testosterone levels along with no major wars and prolonged peace has led to this feminists say they want to be equal and respected but what they really want and crave deep down is a patriarch to oppress them
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao oh come on everybody knows your story is total bullshit after the last thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,just beeeeeeee urself
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre a man you bang fatties if youre a woman it only confirms rp
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont be butthurt you dont have to compete with men you are not a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,fun fact i think the same about you i get a strong tumblrina we live in teh patrearchee vibe from you
PurplePillDebate,removed,well people who are adherents to a philosophy will tend to believe it helped them could we find a whole lot of feminists who claim feminism really worked for them does feminism therefore work you could certainly argue that the low popularity of the red pill is good evidence that it doesnt work also there are quite a few accounts of reformed red pillers who tried it and said it didnt work or it kind of worked but ultimately made them unhappy
PurplePillDebate,removed,going for the same or different jobs does not mean you compete with men sure you compete with some men but not every man is a genius innovator most people are average only some men are extremely smart and some men are extremely retarded its all because we are men we have only one x chromosome so we are prone to mutations and diversity it is just the way things are its not a good thing or a bad thing some men are innovators yet some are rapists some are ceos and some are felons i dont understand why do you think its unfair that men are what they are its almost like you hate the fact that you were born a woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,looks too feminine to me though i am not a woman so theres that
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont know he just doesnt look badass enough to me maybe its because of the work context that i associate with being a beta
PurplePillDebate,removed,reading my comment history eh
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats right most men do not compete with specific men it would be ridiculously retarded if an uneducated drunkard with no trade or profession said these ceos are being classist to me earning so much money because when you really completely disregard gender you no longer care about who is a woman and who is not its just a group of people and some turn out to be smarter than others it is when feminists come and say women are equal to men and declare that all men are sexist because there are more smart and successful men that you get a cognitive dissonance feminists the sexist fucks are the reason why you start taking gender into account they are why you expect there to be as many smart women as men if you really truly didnt care about gender at all it would not matter to you because there would be no distinction between men and women for you the inventors and geniuses would just be people for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,if she is a woman feminism exposed he is a woman is a valid sentence i thought women were only satisfied and enriched by locking down an alpha at a young age and any other lifestyle turns them into malicious whoreish robots or something ill disregard your bait but ill elaborate on my point rp says women ride the cc and slut around she if she is a woman then confirm it by saying how promiscuous she is
PurplePillDebate,removed,i laugh when bloopers tell me im completely wrong and following a fucked up doctrine i laugh because i know they are wrong i know that because my own success story is real i would not be where i am now had it now been for the redpill i would not be healthy physically or emotionally if it werent for the redpill i would not have a great relationship or the soundness of mind to pursue my goals of it werent for the redpill well what the heck did you do man what advice did you take on board and apply to your life
PurplePillDebate,removed,who stores money in a cookie jar
PurplePillDebate,removed,i should give him a cookie youre the mvp of team woman lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,but did you tell him altlas did you communicate the issue
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah looks like he got triggered for lack of a better word hes probably one of the dudes who jackhammered for years only to find out his partner had been faking orgasms the whole time i do honestly find it sad that people and young ladies especially have problems communicating in the sack its put strain on my own relationship but thats not at all what this whole talk is about
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a function key i am the prize shes not yours its just your turn its tomassais iron rule watch what they do not what they say
PurplePillDebate,removed,you need to switch up your use of obvious and absurd in this and a glimmer of understanding may blossom and take flight
PurplePillDebate,removed,cmon man by now you should already know that all piv is rape
PurplePillDebate,removed,read the sidebar duh
PurplePillDebate,removed,he loves arguing a straw man instead of what the actual user wrote user i think men deserve custody rights to their child him but all of you think only women should have custody user i literally just said the opposite of that him silence or switches topic moves goal posts
PurplePillDebate,removed,ooooookaayyyyy thats enough reddit for one lifetime
PurplePillDebate,removed,rolling my eyes at your first world problems
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeh theyre stupid did you get my pm
PurplePillDebate,removed,you literally just went on to romanticize the past show me where i said all the women were perfectly satisfied because thats what you mistakenly think i think women didnt even give their husbands blow jobs back in the day why would they lol there you go again pulling stuff out your ass how would you have a clue what women did back then your debate tactics are absurd youre basically making up ridiculous claims with nothing to back them up and then you sit back cross your arms and stare as if youve made a cogent point gtfo with that lol at sources look it up yourself and this whats contradictory is expecting lots of sex from a woman who has no apparent sex drive whos assuming she has no apparent sex drive oh right you are no lets just pretend for a minute that a woman can have a sex drive and gasp simultaneously abstain from having sex you know excercise a little agency maybe at one point in time women could engage in responsible costbenefit analysis fto calculations etc nahhh bollocks women are slaves to their emotions right wtf was i thinking feminism tells women theres nothing wrong with pursing carnal pleasures even when guys will tell you women sleeping around is a bad look you women get mad ignore it chastise the men for thinking it etc anything other than heeding the advice why because men are saying it and fuck men amirite who needs em you got feminism and girl power tm yay go independent woman i for one am enjoying the decline the death of men like me makes it all the more easy for me to get what i want out of women yall are so easy and predictable you special snowflakes you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree with you op while its true that people shouldnt rape its also just as true that people shouldnt steal or murder there are rules of common sense that most of us know by young adulthood things like dont park an expensive car on this street after or dont leave your windows open and front door unlocked if you live innear a bad neighborhood or if you flash a wad of cash in your wallet at random shady bar itll probably be stolen by the end of the night we take normal everyday precautions with our money cars homes the safety of our children etc i dont think its any different than taking care of yourself as an individual
PurplePillDebate,removed,nobody wants to see how the sausage is made nobody wants to hear how hard you work at the gym or how closely you watch your diet or how you practiced your movements and conversations in front of a mirror thats not magical they respect a guy who just seems like he was born a badass like it just naturally comes to him like its nothing just an inherent part of him like he lives a charmed life like hes a superstar that guys times more respected than some guy who cant shut up about how hard hes working or spelling out how hes doing it reading the red pill on the internet is like listening to a scrawny guy talking on and on about his diet and workout regimen
PurplePillDebate,removed,im a guy and i dont like getting shit faced without one sober guy wtf you women doing b
PurplePillDebate,removed,this used to be called common sense before feminists started calling it victim blaming and started the whole tell your sons to not rape nonsense
PurplePillDebate,removed,what an excellent proposition lets get the word out
PurplePillDebate,removed,not trying to insult you but do you have an active sex life because that sounds very virgin like or like really boring sex
PurplePillDebate,removed,the reason women are unfeminine is because of jews marching through western institutions and pushing degeneracy and feminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,capitilising on drunk woman is not normal human sexual behaviour you fucking creep
PurplePillDebate,removed,how do you know about my moderation style atlas b shrugging
PurplePillDebate,removed,how do you know about my moderation style
PurplePillDebate,removed,the more sensible bloops almost always become more red over time when they hang around ppd long enough because a lot of the core rp ideas arent actually too bad the subreddit is just full of idiots
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes you get a lot of bloops here saying you cannot change who you are in response to arguments such as this which theyre predictably doing itt but this is bullshit you change all the time you changed from who you are years ago and you will change again in another years if you can put yourself on a more positive path by learning better social skills working out more etc why wouldnt you your true self is not some sacred cow you must bow to its whatever the fuck you want it to be mate if you can learn better social skills and lift some weights its not rocket science
PurplePillDebate,removed,inhale exhale inhale exhale and so on right now read on yeah still you cant place that on the same level
PurplePillDebate,removed,there are certain particular skills ive picked up on and gotten really good at they like this skills but some have shared that they sort of dislike how i got this skills
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think it legitimately might be an attempt to get you to kill yourself to just ramp up the frustration that much more so that you finally off yourself the hatred bp has for incels is enormous and trp is just a step or two behind
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol notice how she posts in the same manner that a high value man would she says what a high value man would say i think shes a cryptotranny who somehow thinks that male dhv is the same as female dhv hilarious display of solipsism here
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was comparing womens struggles to mens struggles because thats what we are talking about mens perceived struggles im not trying to take it back now im just pointing out that youre dumb haha you made some crazy assumptions that i wanted women to have more rights than men its pretty entertaining to watch you flounder though lol yes it is suicide is a direct consequence of divorce i agree so why dont these mgtow guys do something about it reach out to guys going through divorce advocate going to the doctor advocate talking about their feelings etc instead they just bitch about women who they blame for their suicidal thoughts comparing unicorns to marriage is a stretch oh okay so you are an idiot i was comparing unicorns to divorce rape neither exists marriage exists well what good is a wife is she is not willing to support you in your endeavors ex wife i mean the fact that you see the problem here is telling you expect husbands to bend over backwards for wives and are so entitled you think anyone not agreeing is against you this is called projecting how am i expecting the husband to do anything what did i ask him to do literally nothing lol you really dont think through arguments do you question how old are you have you ever dated someone
PurplePillDebate,removed,its hard to have a problem with all women its a lot easier to have a problem with say all black people or all muslims they arent a part of every subgroup women on the other hand are everywhere in everyones life theres no degree of separation
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are using the wrong definition of the words horribly oppressed past successful and revolutionary youre view would change right up if you could just accept the redefinitions
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont want to entertain opponents who are consistently failing to understand my arguments ill not be a monkey in this monkey circus shes such a fucking idiot its disappointing
PurplePillDebate,removed,i didnt know that feminism only exists as outrage porn on rtumblrinaction im sure you dont know a lot of things
PurplePillDebate,removed,strength toughness protectiveness aggression
PurplePillDebate,removed,great if its a cold hard fact you can provide me a source lol really fuck off you and i both know its true you took the same history classes i did they do their best to cover up the fact that white men completely dominated scientific advancement and began what we know as the modern era by looking for exceptions but its too apparent to cover up you know there were allll sorts of races living in the us at this time right the us was like white and it was generally understood to be a white country white people have done terrible things all other races have done amazing things is that what your jewish sociology teacher told you all races did terrible things whites just did them better and more successfully so we get resented for it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i doubt real feminists by real i mean female even like you dude going the male feminist route wont help you lose your virginity
PurplePillDebate,removed,the chinese invented gunpowder and the white man actually put it to use the babylonians indians invented the without which there would have been no complex arithmetic they didnt invent the concept of zero they invented the word and symbol for zero some people think the irish arent white my so serbianeastern european insists that he is not white some people think arabs are white other people do not etc etc no one does this to any other race you wouldnt be saying what is considered black blah blah blah all this is is a jewish strategy to deconstruct white identity so white people can be subverted against their acting in their own interests white means of indigenous european ancestry
PurplePillDebate,removed,every masculine man defines his own idea of masculinity yes it is a circular definition
PurplePillDebate,removed,womankind can only exist when mankind allows it to thats not a declaration of war thats a child acting spoiled so much so its ridiculous im leaning more and more towards wanting to utilize fear to control women theyre too stupid without it
PurplePillDebate,removed,strength getting shit done not taking shit not being a doormat being stoic being an anchor for your woman during the inevitable emotional storms she will have not apologizing being selfassured being secure in your selfimage a man who is lacking in these will have a difficult time attracting a decent woman the only women will put up with her man being less of a man are fat ugly or otherwise lowvalue woman eg she has mental health issues is a single mom still talks with her ex etc
PurplePillDebate,removed,society greatly disrespects women who are housewives or sahms and calls them gold diggers and lazy both men and women consider domestic tasks degrading and lesser work im ever so sorry that your fragile little self cant take criticism of your life choices
PurplePillDebate,removed,why is it that a mans sex life is seen as being more important than respecting the autonomy of the population because you think that your sex life is more important which in my opinion is absolutely disgusting i love mind readers theres no point in saying anything to you you already know it it saves us both time dont bother responding i saw the future and you replied with more drivel
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont respect a girls space around her body unless unless unless shes owned by a man who will attend to her space thats the only time and guess what lol this attitude is the best cause girls are still property and nothing you or anyone does will change that
PurplePillDebate,removed,ah its becoming clear that when you call people insecure that is just your projection lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,🙄
PurplePillDebate,removed,there are plenty of reasons men dont want to date women slutty fat and crazy are all reasons you need to get over that and work on yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,the usual solution is to lower the standards such that an accusation is sufficient and the accuser must prove his lets be honest women arent convicted of this innocence
PurplePillDebate,removed,true minorities get them to then flunk out and waste them
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe you are autisitic or dyslexic go check a fucking doctor d
PurplePillDebate,removed,evopsych is science after all i though trolling and shitposting was banned on this sub
PurplePillDebate,removed,this isnt true people are products of their environment womyn get massive validation and become entitled why men dont its dabrowskis theories playing out if we had elected bernie hedve put the rich and entitled in their place and restored this country and gender dynamics better than shillary or babybump trump bc no abort
PurplePillDebate,removed,i thought she was innocent but i was wrong i have never heard this even if this was true i dont see how this leads to revenge porn or awalt this post sounds like what happens when a bper who doesnt know what they are talking about tries to theorize
PurplePillDebate,removed,did you see op made a retarded theory and then you tried to out do her because you did
PurplePillDebate,removed,yesyou do im shy and attractive according to everyone around me and i only get hit on sometimes you should shut up about someones life if you arent living it
PurplePillDebate,removed,and i literally own one pair of pants skirts dresses and shorts every day the translation of this is i like to make sure the muscular dudes im attracted to check out my legs and ass its funny how women attempt to rationalize promiscuous behavior
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont play stupid with me the bottom is invisible do not play the stupid game with me
PurplePillDebate,removed,no woman no matter how old fat or ugly will escape the creepy gaze of dirty old men and brown foreigners

PurplePillDebate,removed,your flair said year old virgin you aint slick you got rid of it like last month
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao youre saying this while fingering yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,not a woman but its funny if you have hips and some tits and wear relatively feminine clothes women jeans and tight t shirt is all you exude femininity to me this is why i empathize with fat women and those with bad bodies ie no hips no ass no tits as a slim short man perhaps i ascribe too much of our identity to our build and genetics since i feel most women never really see me as a manly man due to my slight stature
PurplePillDebate,removed,the blue pillers are probably closer to cosplaying women than actually being women
PurplePillDebate,removed,nope
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop overlooking what else we have to offer because you get all hot and bothered when we flash a shoulder you flash that shoulder precisely because you want us to be hot and bothered whether you consciously realize this or notthe famous i only dress up to feel good nonsense so maybe stop overlooking that of you being successful is just because you are female and people appreciate you for that not for any particular talent or intelligence or ambition because chances are very high you dont have either and only got so far riding on your pussy privilege in either case commenting nice boobs on a music video will not get me the girl but it also does not devalue the girl in any way if the comment was shit song but nice rack then yes but just pointing out the nice boobs means simply that nice boobs you would have to be chronically insecure to think this devalues or reduces you in any way
PurplePillDebate,removed,it actually does have the same negative connotations reducing her to just her appearance i swear to god this place is literally indistinguishable from tumblr sometimes in its absurdity i can only hope your flair comes true
PurplePillDebate,removed,in studies of social animals the highest ranking individual is sometimes designated as the alpha males females or both can be alphas depending on the species where one male and one female fulfill this role together they are sometimes referred to as the alpha pair other animals in the same social group may exhibit deference or other speciesspecific subordinate behaviours towards the alpha or alphas alpha animals usually gain preferential access to food and other desirable items or activities though the extent of this varies widely between species male or female alphas may gain preferential access to sex or mates in some species only alphas or an alpha pair reproduce alphas may achieve their status by superior physical strength and aggression or through social efforts and building alliances within the group eyeroll inducing pc style aside pretty accurate and selfexplanatory and of course perfectly applicable to humans who are after all social animals
PurplePillDebate,removed,obviously absurd and impossible to enforce no less impossible than affirmative consent and its not like absurdity ever stopped femnists
PurplePillDebate,removed,was debating with a certain white knight about this in the not filming this thread just yesterday the answer is of course this isnt rape for fuck sake if this actually does spread into actual law the world will truly be going mad
PurplePillDebate,removed,one deception i that i would make punishable by law is paternity fraud
PurplePillDebate,removed,ha silly little girl so sure youll win the fight without ever being a part of one
PurplePillDebate,removed,not wanting to want to mix our genes with reproductively unfit sexually undesirable males wishing mass genocide on ugly men i guess you learn something every day heh also youre projecting waaaaaay too much no one cares if youre not having sex no women is thinking of you in any sexual senseperiod most likely never has you might be thinking youre the center of the world and from your pov it might be true but women most likely stop noticing or thinking about your existence the moment you leave their field of vision smell if you smell bad in addition of looking bad i think you give yourself way too much credit
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sorry for you and your partners for your shitty sex life i assure you for some people it is lots of fun
PurplePillDebate,removed,and you just went full retard
PurplePillDebate,removed,from my extensive research i have yet to find such a creature called a low libido man a few have medical problems but most are just tired of your shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,define occasionally i know for a woman to get turned down once a year is a soul crushing event
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok cool
PurplePillDebate,removed,no now you have some examples of women who are with men that are tired of their shit but dont realize it yet
PurplePillDebate,removed,there was a story the other day about someone who married her organ donor she was pretty hot as well
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre not rp youre bp but anywho enough with semantics do you admit friend zoning guys is shitty for the guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant cyv since i totally agree on both points and the comparison great post i wish i could upvote this more the idea that just being pump n dumped by a high value man adds value to me or my life is sad and a little insulting it is simply n yay how many people would be even aware of if i slept with this man his buddies a few of my girlfriends likely not enough people to mean much why the frick would most people know or care when have women ever been fawned over and praised for sleeping with the guy who didnt call back that is not a good thing regardless of who he is it is not flattering would not make me more valuable and would not really positively change my life youre more likely to be seen as easy and unable to get a high value man to gf you and thats not cute
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you dont agree show me where otherwise go bother someone else in this response our logician confesses to an inability to see the mirror he recently divined
PurplePillDebate,removed,great post women find it validating is a theory that sounds like garbage she doesnt mention validation as a pleasure
PurplePillDebate,removed,where did this neckbeard thing come from and who the fuck grows a neckbeard anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,no transcript and dont know how to make one direct from soundcloud tldr is the first paragraph of my op as to quotes theres too many to pick from
PurplePillDebate,removed,imagine two women one is continually attracting orbiters maybe she is a good person and she discourages the orbiters maybe she is bad and takes advantage of their resources now the woman with no ability to attract orbiters maybe she would like the option the fact is there is a correlation between how generally attractive a woman is and the number of men who tend to try to orbit her a woman with unwanted suitors will probably also attract wanted suitors orbiters are a drawback for an otherwise desirable situation for most human beings like having money now you have to deal with possible robbery
PurplePillDebate,removed,internet white knight to the rescue
PurplePillDebate,removed,i predict that the comment section will have very few examples and many comments trying to rationalize why its not problematic that such feminist voices are distinctly lacking
PurplePillDebate,removed,im an attack helicopter what do i know all i have is my hellfire airtoground guided missile
PurplePillDebate,removed,triggering intensifies trans is mental illness gender is defined at birth femininity masculinity is defined by a hormonal mixture testosterone creates a man read some fucking schoollevel biology books ffs

PurplePillDebate,removed,the very existence of the red pill is indicative of a rape culture id say tbh all of you seem like you are or would be rapists if you could get away with it
PurplePillDebate,removed,the freeze response is the same as saying you feared for your life when you kill someone it is an actual response in some cases but it is being abused because there is no way to disprove it the tragedy is that false accusers are using the freeze response as part of their lie and it belittles actual rape survivors that experience this
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you thick im suggesting its ok if the man goes for it when its the case that the woman was only shittesting
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must be a guy giving such wonderful examples of clear and impossibletomiss signals now be a good girl and read my post again
PurplePillDebate,removed,but dont you see that those women are triggered and freezing up with fear theyre afraid that if they say no theyll get raped because you would totally go home alone with a guy and climb naked into his bed if you thought he was going to rape you
PurplePillDebate,removed,the fact that you think negging rape victims is okay is disgusting and just a nasty display of character
PurplePillDebate,removed,well then i have some news for you regardless of what you see it as its still a commodity men are literally resource fountains women dont marry down men literally are judged on what they are worth what they have built what they can accomplish you are bitching about inherent value get the fuck out of here we all are human but nature doesnt give a shit about your individuality nature knows you exist to make babies that is why females exist are protected and why rape only happens in people there is no rape in animals because nature doesnt care about rape yes i see women as commodities i can also see them as people i see men as commodities and as people the two things are not mutually exclusive its the ability for me to recognize when to see what in which perspective in this case yes commodity look around you you are surrounded by garbage human beings you are one of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,yea i think most of these rapes happen among young people and most girls who have falsely accuse someone of rape also appear to be young perhaps thats against trp notion that women stop maturing at
PurplePillDebate,removed,its only been a problem in college campuses for now in a couple of more years the majority of these women will be released from these institutions into the real world and they will take their bad habits with them as well as their activism
PurplePillDebate,removed,boy are you triggered you cant keep emotions out of rational discussion its way less of a big deal when to lose a job or dont work as opposed to men ive met plenty of women i love most of them i love that feminine nature i love that different energy that i just dont have women are great they cook food i enjoy give me company of course sex and even sometimes they are a nice thing to lean on but what you are is not who you are who they are is great what they are is what i recognize all guns are loaded but like i said i can switch perspectives where you cant or wont i cant tell im sorry you cant see things in a non emotional way shit must be hard but i dont feel for you just like you dont feel for me
PurplePillDebate,removed,right
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you hot serious question we only care how hot girls behave and attractive women overwhelmingly behave like this
PurplePillDebate,removed,so
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh youre doing this now if youre just going to play stupid im done seriously what are you talking about you sound off your hinges and when i say men need to take risks its because they do asking women out or making sexual advances and risking rejection
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wouldnt know my education has largely consisted of being intellectual and metaphorically castrated time and again lest my brutish male impulses kick in and cause me to oppress and exterminate the unfortunate minorities and women around me what little ive picked up of the english language was through self tutoring and absorbing the words of old and ancient authors from a time before society was hamstrung by feminism and political correctness so sorry to have offended you with my amateurish attempts at allocution bad white male bad i am now hitting myself in real life in hopes that it will absolve me of my sins to at least some extent in the eyes of you redditors please please forgive me i promise to never again misuse these precious words that you clearly have sole ownership and discretion over
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh please ye of the thinnest skin get your emotions under control its an observation if you dont agree explain why thats called debate
PurplePillDebate,removed,id ask him point blank what stupid shit did you do to end up in a situation where you got jumped followed by did you deserve the ass whooping because depending on what went down he may have gotten exactly what he deserved or he may have just been stupidly in the wrong place at the wrong time wow what a great friend
PurplePillDebate,removed,found the rapist
PurplePillDebate,removed,bye felicia
PurplePillDebate,removed,you want other men to be asexual not you okay new dumbest thing you have ever said youre on a roll today this literally makes no sense none at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,i basically have two plans one of them involving suicide the other involving sacrificing myself for the greater good by reproducing and marrying and then committing suicide because i would be unhappy
PurplePillDebate,removed,okay the last two but the first one meets your criteria no criminal charges or police report dingus
PurplePillDebate,removed,first of all ill do what the fuck i want second of all aint no fuckin fallacy in what i said you made the dumbass assumption that all women claim to be strong and independent and because of that getting coercedmade uncomfortable during sex makes them weak thats disrespectful to women that have been put in this situation and its disrespectful to feminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,where is the lie
PurplePillDebate,removed,i guess im just used to most people not being antisocial pricks and at least making an effort to reciprocate someones approach including myself if approached maybe its also a culture thing
PurplePillDebate,removed,so what should they compliment instead your bitchy standoffishness
PurplePillDebate,removed,truth
PurplePillDebate,removed,struth

PurplePillDebate,removed,incel dear god guy can you not see what your problem is when we do adopt an incel im definitely not picking you i think ill go with uonclejulien that guy at least has a sense of humor and some good potential
PurplePillDebate,removed,its now motherfuckers its the current year goyim
PurplePillDebate,removed,only date waifus problem solved
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop reading rp pretty obvious you just outlined how it is poisoning your outlook on life and you continue to be involved in it that is not a healthy or smart thing to do
PurplePillDebate,removed,well theres a lot of rp guys in this thread who agreed with the op so youre wrong in this response our intrepid logician conflates popularity with logic itself
PurplePillDebate,removed,that being said red pillers many of whom are prolife would all cheer if i got raped youre an idiot
PurplePillDebate,removed,this response is hilarious have an upvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre saying your just scum and we should deal with it as the sun burns you and the winter chills you we should just come to expect scum
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is no smoke without fire if feminists didnt abuse perfectly normal healthy boys into trans faggot queer whateverthefucks no one would care

PurplePillDebate,removed,so basically you want men to have no sexual outlet if they are nonchads and not fat fetishists duly noted fuck men anyway if they are loser nonchads women are special princesses® though their sexuality matters can we talk about women and their special hopes dreams desires and whims some more tldr check your privilege

PurplePillDebate,removed,since they have decided that incels arent worth mating with what is the difference they just want you guys to leave them alone as they seek the attention of dark triad alphas and if close to the wall wealthy stupid betas whether you kill yourself or not is not really their concern like many betas you folks are genetically finished anyways

PurplePillDebate,removed,its a fine line that separates genius from insanity most of those dudes could have been successful artists leaders businessmen etc if they had been born in a slightly different place or taken a road a bit different they had immense potential but lost it along the way or were just plain unlucky or were off by a little bit of course they are more attractive than a bunch of weak boys who feel sorry for themselves and will never accomplish anything in life
PurplePillDebate,removed,it all comes down to being masculine alpha determined good at what you do however u wanna phrase it and doing what you you want to do no hesitation no caution no excuses nothing shuts up shop downstairs vagina for a woman like depression or being beta does women are programmed in this way and they cant help it
PurplePillDebate,removed,im way over people acting less intelligent than they are to derail threads and mods are like yeah totally fine with that
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not my opinion of another persons intelligence im over people using intellectual dishonesty here and the mods think its fine wtf
PurplePillDebate,removed,they deserve the right to make a fully informed decision why do you feel they do that women need to have their decisions made for them as in they should be raped because men know who their partners should be so how am i to understand this part women get to vote because they are citizens over so they meet all the requirements to vote in america thats not an answer you imbecile thats like me making a law that everybody called steve should be killed and you defending its because its a law obviously it was a disastrous decision that should and will be reversed with all feminists murdered or enslaved
PurplePillDebate,removed,if someone is willing to literally destroy them self why not just approach a tonne of women carelessly or hire an escort
PurplePillDebate,removed,fair enough woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists operate as a collective femalegendered unit being female is the criteria feminists dont want incels like yourself to swallow a pill that actually kills you read does something because a lot of weeping mothers will really target and lash out at women generally causing a lot of disturbances in the female sphere and the glory of chads wouldnt be blossoming without juxtapositional incels
PurplePillDebate,removed,no
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol lol lol oh my goodness sorry but im gonna need to see an official sciencetm peer reviewed study to back up your question before i can respond

PurplePillDebate,removed,youve already failed at securing a high status man you cant win just lose less youre a sociopath too what a surprise fortunately youll never have the ambition to do much so tell yourself what you will to feed your ego and solipsism no surprise business as usual
PurplePillDebate,removed,and if you feel attacked its not my fault problem in many ways it takes one man to build other people and he can repeat several times a day one woman means new people at a time in reality i can argue either side of this but you sound triggered ya should focused on the other words i used
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah well guess what all those stemnerds who you rejected now have the best lives ever being alpha and having threesomes with models on their private jets should have thought about that now youll die alone

PurplePillDebate,removed,you really look bad in this thread i hope more people see this stuff so they can see what a terrible person you are and finally accept that your girl opinion should be completely ignored

PurplePillDebate,removed,youve made some great arguments in this thread the utter lack of empathy on these womens part is very enlightening and clearly the solution is to just not care at all what they think
PurplePillDebate,removed,why do you hate men raised by a single mom amirite
PurplePillDebate,removed,went over your head eh
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,however women care about sex and enjoy sex much less than men youre doing it wrong if thats your reality so if youre a man being hot is what you should focus on becoming not being sexually skillful im going to start calling you captain disappointment this is some of the worst advice a guy can receive ever

PurplePillDebate,removed,yes he literally believes that because hes a straight up sperglord
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean you sound like a dried up feminist from the way you type so i wouldnt doubt it and while i think itd be a bad idea to open a conversation with the word fertility if a woman is attracted to you shes probably going to like that youre a man who talks about things related to having children i know plenty of beautiful women that honestly wouldnt give a shit if i said the stupid fucking word fertility around them only weirdo liberal bpers find this offensive
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree most women love good hot sex ive argued more with mgtow men over this than anybody else so i dont even bother any more i just skip the postcomment if you dont have the drive or capacity to be smooth and sexy then you wont be able to relate or understand a man telling you otherwise
PurplePillDebate,removed,let me ask you a simple question what is your current argument let me guess youre full of shit pretty pathetic if you ask me

PurplePillDebate,removed,the point is in real life you find tomboys you also find girls who are interested in politics and power say danaerys game of thrones is great because it does not conform to your limited subhuman ideas of what a female is or ought to be and instead shows women as people as different people with different personalities

PurplePillDebate,removed,the majority of something collegeeducated women are sluts i think that what most men on here are reffering too i can definitely believe that some small town girls have lower counts on average but only because of social pressure all women are sluts i have fucked at least women and im not some special case women are sluts end of story
PurplePillDebate,removed,facts are not your friends httpwwwmarilynmonroepagescomfacts
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you retarded women are the reason why a lot of men dont wait longer than dates im not waiting months for you to put out when i know that youve had one night stands if women stop being sluts maybe well treat you like we use too cant have your cake and eat it too
PurplePillDebate,removed,because we feminists dont give a shit about the pleasure of men the patriarchy itself was instituted for the pleasure of men flat empty female fictional characters who are in the story only as a male love interest exist for the pleasure of men when we put the pleasure of men first women get treated like shit feminism exists to benefit women not men it is about womens rights
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course they are feminists want sub males to be starved frustrated and under the necessity of getting dopamin from harmful habits instead of sex so that their lives will be even more miserable its a but ironic considering feminists themselves are often sub too although they think they are above average because they can get above average looking men to fuck them
PurplePillDebate,removed,the benefit that poor working man got was that he had sex with his wife perhaps she had only married him because ahem the patriarchy made sure she was denied an education and could not support herself so every night she had to sleep with a man she was repulsed by is your red pill autism too severe to let you see how she was given to him for his pleasure and barred from making a life of her own because he would be more productive at work that way this was the basis upon which the patriarchy was built during the agricultural revolution giving women to men for sexual release so they would work and women had to endure a lifetime of traumatic disgusting sex with a man they were probably repulsed by and only married for economic survival oh and there were no laws against marital rape or domestic abuse either so yeah the patriarchy is based upon men getting their sexual release through the systematic enslavement of women

PurplePillDebate,removed,lol stuff like this is why blue pillers are stupid essentially blue pillers want women to have sexual choice but not men thats why they shame us at every chance men and women like different traits in their partners is it insecure for a shy woman to like aggressive men for a short woman to like tall men and many women are disgusted by short men or timid men the same way many men are disgusted by sluts
PurplePillDebate,removed,not all women are like that but at least one is one is enough to fuck up your life backed by the biased criminal justice system you need to shut your whore mouth

PurplePillDebate,removed,if youve found your way to that gym cherish it its truly a gift from the gods what you most likely did is project why you dont like the gym onto this rare ideal instead of walking into one of the hundreds in your town and see average people walking around fumblefucking through the equipment with one or two fit people in front of the free weights

PurplePillDebate,removed,im not sure if you intended to prove the thread correct in its assumption or if youre trolling either way great job see ya
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do not believe for one fucking minute that a man who has only sense of humor kind and nice is sexually attractive your sense of humor just isnt that sexy what do you do dad puns and bitter selfdepreciation rehearsed stories that arent at all relevant to the moment cmon cough up the details

PurplePillDebate,removed,i know many of you have been pondering a thousand times how you would save the school in case of an terrorist attack and thus would get the hot cheerleader to fall in love with you but the truth is that you would cowardly hide yourself and shit your pants you wouldnt save the day you would be terrified shivering and crying are you serious i stopped reading after this point your posts are just becoming more and more masturbatory i doubt many high school kids even go to this subreddit i doubt many people here have the patience to wade through paragraphs of you making baseless assumptions and belittling your audience plus a sprinkling of white knighting towards women who are so much more wonderful than men and so tragically oppressed ive been wrong before tho
PurplePillDebate,removed,im glad you finally responded to my post but the truth is that you would cowardly hide yourself and shit your pants you wouldnt save the day you would be terrified shivering and crying hi someone tried to rob me at a grocery store parking lot last christmas but i was fine because i quickly drew my glock from the holster in my car door compartment and he took off running when he saw it just because youre helpless doesnt mean everyone is your fight and flight response kicks in but if your fear circuitry perceives escape as impossible and resistance as futile then not fight or flight but extreme survival reflexes will take over you can become paralyzed by fear just like a deer in the headlights thats unable to move or you can collapse due to fear like animals that play dead depending on the situation your brain might also enter a dissociative state everything becomes blurry your mind spaces out everything feels unreal and you are disconnected from the horrible emotions and sensations is this how you bloopies deal with adversity or danger do you freeze up while driving and some moron nearly hits you how can someone like this function
PurplePillDebate,removed,not according to my definition

PurplePillDebate,removed,not gonna change your view awalt rules still apply for pokemon go as they would other dating apps be attractive dont be unnatractive all shes really accomplishing with this article is angering low smv guys and pushing them towards trp good for her
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not sure why you seem so offended that i only work in luxury settings i can explain this to you because you are not going to get a direct answer from op its because the idea of a woman having or enjoying nice things is distressing to because he is a misogynist i recognize that the stock line around here is to go yeah im a misogynist so well ill tell you so the fact that he is a misogynist means he hates women and the idea of them suffering provides him with an enjoyable sensation of justice being served in the same way watching the bond villain die at the end of the movie is satisfying for most peopleconversely the idea of a woman having pleasant experiences like making money on her own terms while enjoying luxury settings is upsetting to him because it means someone he hates is not sufferingbeing punished as he feels they should its watching the bond villain get away free and clear it has nothing to do with you or the setting you work in and everything to do with upsetting his sense of justice and order its about who he thinks deserves what and unfortunately its colored by his misogyny his feelings on this issue are not something you can have a logical debate about as they have little to do with you or where you work
PurplePillDebate,removed,man youre getting your ass kicked here does your mom know that you talk like this to women
PurplePillDebate,removed,and benzene apparently
PurplePillDebate,removed,this isnt news if a sexually attractive guy does behavior x a woman is inviting if an unattractive guy does the exact same behavior x under the exact same circumstances the woman is creeped out and posts on the internet about how she was horribly uncomfortable and verily feared she was about to be raped said another way women dont trust unattractive guys if youre unattractive and you chat up a girl about some video game on her cell phone the woman immediately assumes you have unsavory intentions youre not a nice fellow making polite conversation about a common interest youre a creep trying to leverage the fact that shes into this game into some kind of awkward bid for sex she knows this because youre unattractive you dont have options with women the very fact that youre talking with her about some video game is probably the most interaction youve had with any woman all month she knows that due to your lack of options this conversation is a big deal to you and youre going to try to use it to get somewhere with her shes on to you if youre attractive and you chat up a girl about some video game on her cell phone the woman knows its no big deal youre just a nice fellow making polite conversation about a common interest you could have your pick of women so as a man with options she knows some random conversation with a girl about a video game is no big deal to you but hey since the two of you are both into the same thing maybe she should fuck you and see where things go since its such a great coincidence that the two of you met like this
PurplePillDebate,removed,hopefully this sheds some light for bpersbut as we can already see with these comments it wont people just dont want to confront and admit that we live in a female dominated smp and guys are inherently judged on their smv and sexual worth to women
PurplePillDebate,removed,why else do you think female sexuality used to be considered rare and a mental disease at one point ah looks like you did read my reply to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont see any irony here its like you think the highclass setting is just for the prostitutes its hilarious well no its not its sad but hes really triggered by it he doesnt realize how transparent he is to adults he thinks its about what she thinks she deserves and hes trying to red pill her pussy right off that silk covered pedestal for dear life because pussies dont deserve silk covered pedestals according to some things he read on the internet hell grow up thankfully he actually is a kid
PurplePillDebate,removed,the fact that this cunt is allowed to shit her toxic misandrist views into a printed newspaper is sickening imagine a man enters a femaledominated hobby and then rants about ugly women talking to him do you think he would be allowed to publish a newspaper article about that
PurplePillDebate,removed,either that or youre wrong ill go with the latter

PurplePillDebate,removed,female privilege mostly manual labor is supposed to be reserved for men it would be like a white guy picking cotton in the while a perfectly good negro sits on the porch it challenges the whole social order of who exists to serve whom
PurplePillDebate,removed,bringing stupid and irrelevant points to the discussion like always
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one in bp says that your point is idiotic
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao
PurplePillDebate,removed,wait are you saying that both sexs are as shitty as each other no way really or should i be pointing out that women rape men as well cause pretty sure that but they do it isnt a good argument well everytime i have brought up a point with the but they do it line bloops downvote and say it is a crap argument
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive never actually heard the complaints myself its all indirect can you read the interwebs is littered with op eds of this nature

PurplePillDebate,removed,and what else would they have to talk about lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,love that summary
PurplePillDebate,removed,its disrespectful to feminism ah troll a little harder my friend
PurplePillDebate,removed,so yeah probably just that stupid ill write a reply anyway in case anyone intelligent got this far and because its a useful ecercise in formulating my thoughts the twin correlations i would set up are between the female body to the male desire and the female bodily display and the male expression of desire the female desire for male bodies does not play such a vital role in reproduction therefore it cannot be correlated with male desire the idea that women do not choose to put their bodies on display as an expression of their sexuality is obviously absurd to anyone with eyes i really dont have anything to say to women who refuse to acknowledge obvious though inconvenient truths about their own behavior
PurplePillDebate,removed,pfft youre the living example of using the word creepy to describe anyone who does anything involving me i dont like is hurting me i guess homeless people are creepy simply by merit of being in your sight
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow youre legitimately unfuckable and undatable im impressed
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you saying women should do drills so that they know how to react when theyre getting raped fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,you change period less painful much more effective listen to this jamie scott unbreakable girls love it switch the roles and theyd puke the majority of girls simply loathe shy guys so in order to actually increase your chance of ever meeting anyone you should consider working on becoming more extroverted and if not confident at the very least able to fake confidence

PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,uh yeah he said without choking and you said start choking pretty big difference between choking and not choking putting your hands around someones throat is choking what part of that dont you understand they even agreed with it being choking if you read their reply to me which i highly doubt given your poor reading skills youre backpedaling uh nope you just selectively reading things and that twisting them as you pleased the discussion earlier was never about me getting consent it was about getting consent in general helps to actually follow the conversation you know and that not read the parts you want to read while ignoring the parts you dont want to read
PurplePillDebate,removed,best answer thread is over
PurplePillDebate,removed,that as a parent crap is the biggest copout ive ever heared being a parent doesnt enshrine you in some secret knowledge go and wipe some shitty arses

PurplePillDebate,removed,transexual
PurplePillDebate,removed,the guy from american horror story season but less good looking and more mommy issues
PurplePillDebate,removed,the one thing this culture of critique we have in the west fails to account for is the fact were animals with natural instincts and whilst in a very logical sense there is no reason why certain things are wrong most people who engage in them are damaging themselves in the long term an example is transgenderism there is no reason why you should not have hormones surgery dress differently because in doing so you are not hurting another person but if you look at the suicide rates even post operation its astonishingly high
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a coward and a phoney tell your mum that youre not going to vote for him if youre not going to youre a grown woman you can vote for who you like
PurplePillDebate,removed,definition of hypocrisy hypocrisy n c ipocrisie the sin of pretending to virtue or goodness from old french ypocrisie from late latin hypocrisis hypocrisy also an imitation of a persons speech and gestures from attic greek hypokrisis acting on the stage pretense metaphorically hypocrisy from hypokrinesthai play a part pretend also answer from hypo under see hypo middle voice of krinein to sift decide see crisis the sense evolution in attic greek is from separate gradually to answer to answer a fellow actor on stage to play a part the h was restored in english hypocrisy is the art of affecting qualities for the purpose of pretending to an undeserved virtue because individuals and institutions and societies most often live down to the suspicions about them hypocrisy and its accompanying equivocations underpin the conduct of life imagine how frightful truth unvarnished would be i put this here because most people dont seem to understand what hypocrisy is lying about your ncount certainly looks like the sin of pretending to virtue or goodness so yes they are hypocrites
PurplePillDebate,removed,the hate of promiscuous women i feel has always stemmed from a power differential the people who are really butthurt about women sleeping around are men who have never had the same availability and power in the smp men with similar levels of power and attractiveness feel much more for hoes since they themselves actually know how it feels to be able to bang people pretty much whenever attractive men understand the power high and as such attribute it much less to personality than to circumstances
PurplePillDebate,removed,whatever you need to tell yourself to get through the night
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah this is exactly correct in fact from everything ive seen and experienced high value men are more likely to dump a woman for not putting out fast enough they prioritize sex and expect their partners will too its nonnegotiable especially this part we dont do the romance thing until we are sure there is strong sexual chemistry and tangible personality connections and even then
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh of course not dont you know men can sleep with a million different women and then settle down to a committed relationship no problem they can totes separate their feelings from sex s
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have had this argument in here a hundred times i have listed an endless number of high partner count men who went on to marry and have children with high partner count women who were ex pornstars and ex lesbians the idea that kid rock cried at night worrying that pam anderson was comparing his weiner to tommy lees is ludicrous alpha males always think they are the best thing a woman has ever had they dont sit around crying over what else has been in there there is nothing wrong with prp worrying about this at all its probably a good guideline for them since they are all just regular guys with jobs but to ascribe this attitude to alphas is the part where it becomes stupid
PurplePillDebate,removed,worth more than what than a girl with no impulse control selectivity or sense of self worth who not you ms pussy non profit im not paying for whats already free
PurplePillDebate,removed,red pill guys fantasize about wielding power almost as much as they fantasize about chads big cock lol did this make you feel good
PurplePillDebate,removed,snark the cornerstone of uskinnysweatys dominance d
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol at op editing that last bit out
PurplePillDebate,removed,you did not start this thread in good faith i started it in good humor sorry should have put a trigger warning in for you guys why dont you head back to your safe space over at rp
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive heard more and more women are watching porn but just wondering how it addictive do guys feel a human connection when they watch it like theyre lonely or something or os it just pleasure probably just pleasure
PurplePillDebate,removed,and putting your head in the sand and screaming lalalala doesnt prove that it does exist just that youre good at ignoring the reality do you think i seriously went into every relationship with an opportunistic transactional mindset or do you think i slowly arrived at my viewpoint after multiple experiences and observation of others take your time
PurplePillDebate,removed,such rule following o
PurplePillDebate,removed,its when you say aw come on responsive to a rejection and the woman says okay and does what you want because as we all know sex is a pretty trivia recreational act women would rather have sex that they really really dont want then have an awkward verbal conversation and as we all know theres no point in rejecting a guy hes just going to hurt you really badly then rape you anyway percent of guys do this so really once a guy says aw come on hes pretty much manipulated you into it and theres nothing you can do
PurplePillDebate,removed,some power that men have over women a womans mind is apparently weak enough to be mind controlled by a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats an autistic and conspiratorial interpretation of why there words for the same thing reminds me of a youtube vid where a guy took issue with girls cup featuring a glass instead of an actual cup
PurplePillDebate,removed,agreed all information has to be useful in the marketplace of ideas or else the idea dies instead of censoring or trying to dissuade people from learning about trp if bp was truly convinced trp didnt work they would want as many men as possible to try it fail and come back to the correct way of thinking i encourage all men to adopt trp for themselves and see whether it works or not
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think what you see going on is actually a backwards rationalization they first perceive the offencive content as sexist racist whatever and then when confronted with but does it work is it true it causes cognitive dissonance wellits sexistif its sexist it cant be truetherefore it doesnt work and its not true
PurplePillDebate,removed,is trp doing that or are women doing that men wouldnt turn to trp if it offered absolutely no answers and absolutely no solutions and had a success rate and of course there are successful trp men therefore if women are sexually selecting for trpesque men and these men are returning to rp to tell all the other men hey this shit works how is it mens fault trp makes the world a worse place sex is selling yourself trp is training salesmen with sales tactics how is it mens fault women are buying the cars i mean suggesting its trp thats making the world a worse place is an odd claim for a poster most prolific for her overinflated ego who selfidentifies as an in her
PurplePillDebate,removed,absolutely not you think so because you live in a social environment permeated by feminist rapeculture propaganda rape isnt undesired sex its unconsensual sex feminists started this confusion by assuming that women consent to sex when they desire it and dont when they dont they then treated these two things as the same but women frequently consent to sex they dont desire and desire sex they dont consent to the same way that you might go to work on monday morning even though you dont want to and really want that piece of cheesecake which youre not going to eat because youre too fat already women are often quite okay with not being given a choice about sex so long as they like the man and the sex and some women want to not be given a choice this is what rape fetish is about and go read some romance novels if you dont think there are a lot of women turned on by that no woman wants sex she doesnt want that is an oxymoron but plenty of women want sex they have no control over
PurplePillDebate,removed,rape apologist detected take kants model of philosophy would you like to live in a world where everyone follows rtheredpills advice
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes women do like to be raped by dominant men large muscular dominant men over and over and over very roughly sorry about no punctuation typing with one hand the thought of being raped by a dominant man over and over roughly arouses you so much that you have to masturbate while typing it and only use one hand interesting explains a lot about the red pill mentality and focus on dominant men and muscles and the pedestal you all put chad on
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre not approaching women then something that makes you approach women can give you a greater than chance of success two issues here firstly youre talking about the odds of man against an entire city full of women even if he had a chance of scoring that means only every tenth woman he meets would want him thats not very good odds that the woman he approaches would be the woman in that would be willing to date him secondly it is female solipsism that action necessarily success because as a woman action has an exponentiation effect on success if you are an undesirable man you could be in the percentile of action yet the percentile of failure this also doesnt address the point whatsoever you claimed trp makes the world a worse place by its existence i said women are making the world a worse place by selecting for these kinds of men voluntarily then you replied with if you approach women your success cant be how is this relevantand why havent you addressed the point and ive never said that i said i was an when i was young and ive aged gracefully much more so than most guys my age so i dont think ive lost position among my age cohort lol an out of is still an extremely bold and generous rating to self access you better have nipples that lactate chocolate milk and the body of a victoria secret model to call yourself an in the pillsphere and have anyone take you seriously from then on out thats really just my personal criticism of your ego though its not really the point
PurplePillDebate,removed,bloops are just bullies
PurplePillDebate,removed,because he was joking
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre black you get the max if youre white its all right there was another athlete who was convicted of rape when he was he got years in jail only to find out the girl was lying this douchebag gets monthswhen he actually raped her typical rich white male privilege arent profiled like other races arent arrested like other races arent given the same sentencing as other races then try to point to statistics to prove their racist points as if their group is being held to the same standard
PurplePillDebate,removed,marriage the ultimate dick move by women
PurplePillDebate,removed,well you are a snowflake we are talking about the other billion women on the planet
PurplePillDebate,removed,its basically a pro rape terrorist organization why wouldnt someone feel threatened by it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i feel bad for your so
PurplePillDebate,removed,no need to get defensive
PurplePillDebate,removed,man stop this kid is getting scorched across the internet everybody except whites sees the unfairness in this sentencing and everybody except whites knows its because hes a rich white kid if you cant see the discrepancy im not about to waste a single fucking second explaining how the american justice system discriminates against minorities you wouldnt get it because youre white your first link makes no sense there was a manhunt in nyc for those black kids with half the internet ready to lynch them brock turner wasnt even arrested those brooklyn kids were vilifed until it came out the girl was a prostitute and the guy wasnt her father if the truth didnt come out those kids wouldve received football numbers while this fuck head gives a few months take your false equivalencies elsewhere brian banks tells you to fuck off by the way stupid ass white boy
PurplePillDebate,removed,how about you post more rape cases that you have no contextual understanding of i got a great laugh from the first one im reading comments from various media outlets and websites go on youtube and see for yourself only white people in their quest to prove they arent privilege are denying this kids privilege hes rich and hes white so its all right sorry the discussion bothers you white boy guess what though getting treated worse because were not white bothers us more
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes and black people dislike the kkk
PurplePillDebate,removed,only date lawyers or bankers if she does not get prada rolex or a car within the first two weeks she is gone she does not work she lives in a sandstone mansion with a swimming pool and staff her dad is rich she does not even need the money but she knows that every guy wants her she is smart and educated private schools and she likes dating oooh sounds like me
PurplePillDebate,removed,really so how often so you get approached by random guys do you get hit on a lot as an attractive woman hows life going for ya
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you attack tbp because you feel threatened by it or is it because you find it stupid
PurplePillDebate,removed,dirt and pine needles shoved into her vagina lol is that what happened
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont be an asshole
PurplePillDebate,removed,the cdc found that of all women experience some form of sexual assaultrape gotta love those weasel words same study cited an average of rapes per man how do they know this happened now i dont know about the forced ostracization after prison im definitely a believer in rehabilitation and reintegration but they made a choice so i dont know its hard for me to have empathy but i also dont want an increase in criminals solely because they have no other options imo if we are going to put people on sex offenders lists we may as well just kill them not much they can really do these days ordinary people struggle to find work and housing how are sex offenders going to do it lastly if youve never been raped dont pretend like you know what its like or how you would feel about it jfc how do you know i have never been raped mb u missed this sentence i will concede i dont have experience with penetrative violation but my point is that the consequences seem to be more emotional than physical in this case because fingers are not likely to cause stitches
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive gotten jumped stabbed and mugged before i think thats a bit worse than getting two fingers up your butt and i got on with my life i think its weird how any form of sexual assault has become this life ending trauma when there are way worse things that can happen to you and nobody really seems to mind all that much
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats ok no need to rationalize only men on trp get needlessly riled up s
PurplePillDebate,removed,i would never try to dox someone just for having a different worldview if their worldview involved taking rights and privileges away from you youd not only dox them but wanna see them die of leukemia or in a car explosion im pretty pro doxing ive done it to or different guys a lot of it isnt even about getting them back its about seeing how much damage you can do some people wanna do harm just for its own sake if the person is some subhuman redpiller then there is no guilt involved
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you decided to throw a tantrum in public and you lured in an audience by asking people to change your view go change your diaper
PurplePillDebate,removed,yep thats right trp is a group rooted in misandry if a few members hating on single mothers with a boat load of sociological data to be outraged about makes all of trp misogynist then obviously blaming blue pill beta cucked idiots who try to get women into their beds or ballot boxes means that trp is teeming with manhating man men or something i feel so hateful now i need to find a puppy to kick
PurplePillDebate,removed,nobody would offer sexual healing and if you think thats not a thing just try running around with sexual assault ptsd and a sex phobia the way i do is there a bloop out there who is not crazy
PurplePillDebate,removed,kudos for wit id upvote but your point doesnt matter it was a very shallow observation you cant refute what you dont actually understand
PurplePillDebate,removed,game
PurplePillDebate,removed,videos in this thread videocomment httpsyoutubecomwatchvxbwmnyiuywi based on the cultural messages that are sent about men and some of the cultural selfishness presented as the female voice can you blame some of them especially if they were ripped apart a lot of the blatant callous attitudes such as elle kn whip crack bull whip sound effect allsounds ineducation botinfo you have to consider where game was formed it was a reverseengineer of the postrules woman where the rules weaponised the hard to get play verse of the song reproduction from grease grease was set in but im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
PurplePillDebate,removed,if they really think trp is just an uninfluential fringe group why did they devote an entire subreddit to mock it its obvious to me that they know trp concepts can potentially become more widespread many guys want a varied sex life and they have to face the prevalent negative feedback from women and the empty platitudes offered by mainstream culture and bp dont work so they resort to puas trp included
PurplePillDebate,removed,downvote me if you want butthurt fags or you can google you some science
PurplePillDebate,removed,the redpill subreddit is made up of beta males who are suddenly wondering why the beta tactics their fathers and grandfathers used suddenly no longer work
PurplePillDebate,removed,apparently saying negative things about women dehumanizes and objectifies them once women are nonhuman objects its okay to harm them
PurplePillDebate,removed,so its not healthy for men not to wear pink isnt freedom of expression a good thing to have also do you believe the patriarchy prevented this woman from leaving the tub
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why nobody likes talking to bluepillers
PurplePillDebate,removed,no idea i dont read rcommunism to rage masturbate i dont understand what theyre doing
PurplePillDebate,removed,i sense much drama in you
PurplePillDebate,removed,when you see a pattern enough and no contradictions arise i never read a post and think someone is an idiot rather i try to figure out what they must believe for them to say what they did but i dont care to make personal attacks either so hes an idiot never crosses my mind unlike womenwhich isnt a personal attack simply true though feel free to tell me it is one because it feels that way
PurplePillDebate,removed,why the fuck you go into this creeps bathroom when you know good and goddamned well what he wants ssshhhh youll wake up the trolls they will see that common sense and call it victim blaming
PurplePillDebate,removed,this guy has to be a troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,when you see a pattern enough and no contradictions arise but everyone arguing against you also has thousands of hours observing other human beings and they have not all come to the same conclusion as you you dont have anything in this argument beyond i feel like its true as to personal attacks i dont know im reading your convo with shoup right now and youve now passiveaggressively questioned her reading comprehension and her ability to logic as well as accusing her of solipsism you dont even know what these words mean im overtly questioning her reading and logic because her answers make me the answers are nonsensical for what i said nothing passive aggressive its blatant i didnt accuse her of solipsism she flat out said i should know nothing can be proven which is literally the beginning of the philosophical idea of solipsism facepalm im sorry but i have literally no reason to believe that the things youre saying are true are actually true if you want me to believe that theyre true you need more than because i feel very strongly that they are never did i say how i felt i defined how things are and how you can see it in reality the reasons are there in my post but you must understand what it is im trying to say
PurplePillDebate,removed,i havent attacked you i dunno if anybody else has ive stated observations as to your behavior and offered suggestions but i never once threatened you or did anything more than point out issues in your statements and arguments and i dont understand the relevance of your links
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have fun buddies my ovaries are in a knot i personally am socially ostracizing you none of the above is factual
PurplePillDebate,removed,okay
PurplePillDebate,removed,by comparison i dont see nearly as much pain on the other side women complaining about men treating them shittily are often vague and dont seem to have the same amount of emotional damage from it at worst it poisons their current relationships instead of preventing them from happening in the first place but thats just the way things are women get shitty relationships men get no relationships both are painful and damaging but i dont see nearly the same amount of deep specific personal anguish from women i mostly see facebook posts of waa no one thinks im pretty im so lonely with comments from dudes telling her shes pretty and inviting her out
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is the difference in protective vs familia are you saying they love their mother with this protective style and not familia do they want to protect their brothers fathers or frat mates do women not have protective love they dont want to protect their mothers or children or maybe you are making more shit up to justify your beliefs and lifestyle
PurplePillDebate,removed,my thoughts are stops drinking whores
PurplePillDebate,removed,if an illusion as you call bp works for people and gets them happy lives is it still an illusion
PurplePillDebate,removed,only if they bring up a problem that could be ameliorated by understanding some of this stuff im not an evangelist reactions well ive got a direct report following me around like a puppy at work after i told him behind closed doors how to deal with his pathologically immature constantly bickering middle aged female coworkers
PurplePillDebate,removed,i never do most people are psychologically conditioned to be pc as bluepillers are on here people start with some vague defense of an issue but the more you actually break the issue down the more disconnected their defense becomes from the actual problem i have literally seen people here start a argument with point a is so sexist and misogynistic and end it with ok it may not be sexist and misogynistic but its pessimistic and that makes it bad these people will refuse to listen to reason because they are inherently convinced there must be something wrong with your point of view and even if the only wrong thing they can find is some tiny sliver of pessimism they will cling to it to validate their beliefs these people are usually useless to talk to about anything including romance politics and life in general
PurplePillDebate,removed,it would creep most people out beyond belief
PurplePillDebate,removed,as long as you describe it in normal english rather than with all the trp lingo and you soften it up a bit so it doesnt sound so brutal most people will just agree with a lot of rp views yes much of it is not very controversial at its core but like uladybaker i dont evangelise ill only talk about it if someone is asking for advice on their relationships or if were just discussing gender issues in general
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh brother i dont need to be saved by drowning men
PurplePillDebate,removed,you can absolutely talk about fight club there is a just a specific way to do it now i am not saying that im always captain saveaho to any nonrp fellas out there but sometimes having a discussion about women and their tendencies with another man can happen sometimes i just want to verbalize some thoughts ive had lately so we go grab a beer and a discussion happens the trick is in framing and using language that isnt red pill ive had many people men and women alike nod in agreement as ive explained hypergamy or abundance mentality using laymans terms me talking about rp topics usually ends up with the conversing party shaking their head up and down saying yeah that really makes sense but like i said im not a mission or anything to unplug the fucking world or anything but sometimes its fun to get out of my own head and have a conversation about these topics with others its just all about how you do it
PurplePillDebate,removed,blue pill people especially women and very beta men react badly to a lot of red pill truth or lifestyle they get angry and judgmental i think a lot of it depends on where a person comes from what kind of upbringing theyve had how theyve been socialized ive noticed quite a variance between how people in america think versus those in australia canada or the ukeurope so people look at the world differently depending on what vantage point theyre looking from even within america there are regional cultural differences between the northeast corridor versus the deep south or other parts of middle america i think that the blue pillers are conditioned to be angry and judgmental as a default as theyre raised and educated to be angry at what america used to be in the patriarchal and traditional sense of course america has changed a great deal since the and but theres still a lot of latent anger bubbling underneath the surface this is why they have such a scornful and derisive attitude towards the plight of the modern male in todays society they laugh about the male suicide rate and say things like i drink male tears yet they really cant seem to understand why some men might take umbrage at that and respond with some hostility of their own what they dont understand is that the red pill and the manosphere in general is just men responding in kind to what men have had to put up with over the past years when men try to express their dissatisfaction in more appropriate ways they get accused of whining and acting all butthurt which are favorite terms used by the bpers so the only other response that men have is to either be silent or respond with outright hostility and hatred hostility begets hostility hatred begets hatred it only escalates it never subsides until one side screams uncle and quits which is something the blue pillers will never understand thats because they view politics from an ivory tower in purely insulated academic terms they dont understand it on a street level for example there are a lot of women these days who are justifiably concerned about rape and violence against women and there are men who instinctively feel a desire to protect their society and way of life from those who would threaten it both from within and without but due to decades of misinformation and the hobbling of men a lot of men either cant or wont follow that instinct without any real role models to follow theyve lost their bearings and the manosphere is where some of them end up i think of women like emma watson one of the many privileged princesses of feminism who says she wants men to step up and help them in their cause but what cause should men fight for and why should they i saw an article about a woman journalist in germany saying she wants men to fight off violent muslim immigrants with their fists but why should they what incentive do women actually offer for men to put their lives on the line like that women make demands upon men but offer next to nothing in return to answer your original question i dont think its right to let blue pillers live in their illusion since its ultimately harmful to society and to future generations its a dangerous world out there and western men have to toughen up and grow a stronger backbone but that comes as a whole package not something that one can pick and choose which parts are politically convenient and which are politically incorrect women and blue pillers dont understand that at all and that will be their undoing
PurplePillDebate,removed,you mean a lot of men like intelligent conversations thats so shocking
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you completely stupid or just being deliberately disingenuous they are not able to attract any women at all they often get rejected over and over again in some cases they have been dumped by their wives after years of a sexless marriage they cant compete in a game in which status and looks are so important i believe the op makes this quite clear

PurplePillDebate,removed,one can postulate it from your writing but i am going to stop feeding the troll and i suggest anyone else reading this post to do the same
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp roosh etc has warped my view of men so much that i feel this way too thank you internet
PurplePillDebate,removed,bravo
PurplePillDebate,removed,everybody must be at the gym today i just got back from my workout i wonder as much as everybody talks about lifting if we could have a thread about that just saying
PurplePillDebate,removed,cmv im a guy and none of that sounds unreasonable people are different and different things make them happy if this makes you happy then congratulations on finding happiness and i wish you the best
PurplePillDebate,removed,why should anyone change your view i think humanity is better off if you keep your pov to be honest
PurplePillDebate,removed,incel euthanization is a good idea it will take all of those men with inferior genetics out of the gene pool we will not have to worry about the incel uprising happening or something similiar happening like an elliot rodgers
PurplePillDebate,removed,you should look more into the negatives that half breed children suffer from
PurplePillDebate,removed,ssssh there is always the possibility that high school chad university chad the chad from your job years ago the chad you banged while on a trip in thailand and some other random chad whose name you dont even remember will find each other and visit your husband to recount all the gruesome detailes of your onss with them
PurplePillDebate,removed,so backed up by anecdotal data rather than actual science lol okay silly surveys you sound like a fucking retard
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah thats gay
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am just doing that do you thing my ratings are wrong or do you just want to chit chat bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,i went out doors this one time and met a real feminist i wasnt even charged for raping her
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think that maybe the way the blue pill people see it it makes sense think about it most average and below average guys will do all that work and spend time and money doing all those things you point out just so they can have the chance of having sex or a relationship with an average girl these guys are so thirsty and desperate that they flood girls with attention and validation so girls get an inflated sense of self worth and entitlement something that is caused mostly by these thirsty men and also the reason that they do what they do they are the ones begging and also the ones complaining truth is trp does not exist solely because of women it exists because of women and these men they will accept any girl justify getting into a relationship with them and spending time and money on them if girls didnt have all this attention they would be very different and maybe these guys would have some chance of a better deal but since they are the ones begging they put themselves in a position where they deserve being treated the way they do they are begging for sex will waste a huge amount of time for a girls attention they are pathetic and deserve to be treated like so
PurplePillDebate,removed,blue pill isnt interested in helping guys who go to trp theyre more interested in mocking and further shamming guys who are struggling bpers claim trp is full of mean people but reading some of their posts lately has me believing that blooper are the ones who hold so much hate towards struggling guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you get a kick out of hanging around subs like this to laugh at confused and struggling guys pretty sociopath
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol at privileged never forget the ageage perception is projection it will describe almost all of the vitriol at the top end of tbp the rest is a femenine version of as usuall per patriarchy its only as edgy for every pepe has or whatever chan it is now femenists even invaded there from what im told
PurplePillDebate,removed,seconded on the one above with the pedantic flair
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree with terpers that attraction is mostly objective and that self improvement is necessary for an improved sex life however i agree with bloopers regarding most other rp philosophy as i find much of it to be paranoid and easily explainable through basic common sense and an understanding of enforced gender roles as opposed to some hypergamous feminist conspiracy yeah thats the thing about trp really its mostly great if you ignore literally everything they say about womendatingrelationships of it is get your shit together and is women suck treat them like crap
PurplePillDebate,removed,the lack of compassion for men in general is what eventually set me on the course for trp an ex of mine who i had known for almost years who had been routinely prodding to get to know me better wanting me to let down my armor so to speak as soon as i did she basically mocked me for what i shared with her she wanted to know what kind of past i had and how i grew up etc when i told her that i had a hard life full of pain she pretty much lost respect for me at that point because i showed her that im not always strong that i feel pain that im not some impenetrable mountain from that point on it was all downhill she would hold what i told her against me and use it to take jabs at me etc you cant expect men to just smile and nod at being treated like that and to not have it change the way he views relationships when it happens so consistently
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes
PurplePillDebate,removed,sorry didnt read past the first few sentences of your comment but yeah were totally a circlejerk we love it its great
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbp is so counter intuitive that you cant really take what they say seriously trp at least takes unsuccessful men and says what youre doing isnt working here work on yourself and stop jumping through hoops tbp looks at an unsuccessful man and says you havent been jumping through those hoops well enough here waste your time and money on hobbies and then have a maybe chance with one girl if you had genuine interest in hobbies that women were also interested in youd already have the exposure to those women and wouldnt be taking any pill youre talking about months of time spent trying to gain access to a single person vs redpill where you try to spin plates and if you really like one you stick with her
PurplePillDebate,removed,definitely
PurplePillDebate,removed,as a you can be someones yeah a tyrone like the white dude from mr robot i mean hes a little bitch lol no i mean black guys who sell weed i have zero respect for a white girl once shes been blacked fucking lol at expecting me to literally be a cuck meme if anything you should be pissed at men lol no its women who say yes its funny how women dont want agency when it means they could actually be doing something wrong my view is much less pessimistic and deterministic youre a woman youre blue pill by nature
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are being racist and thats not nice im being truthful and the truth isnt nice black people are also just people people with lower average iq and higher testosterone that belong in sub saharan africa dont act like if the situation was flipped youd be up on your high horse of virginity while people literally clamored for a chance to bump uglies with you i would hope i at least wouldnt be a nigger loving whore dont make men out to be the more purer sex when they are just as much to blame as a woman the only way man are too blame is being dumb enough to allow women total sexual freedom or the right to vote
PurplePillDebate,removed,greek lady i am going to scientifically provide a answersolution for and to their problems do cracking coke some of that exxxxtasyyy and perhaps even some of the mdma and go to a party and go fuck bitches
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound obsessed tbh and are projecting a lot probably spend most of your waking hourlife on rshort or something like that short men are inferior only from the pov of women wanting to pass on attractive genes if youre seen as sexually unattractive then for all intents and purposes you are reproductively undesirable i doubt you have the capacity to grasp that however do you often comment on whether some women should be able to reproduce whats with the eugenics obsession anyway let naturepeople do their thing and choose with whom they want to reproduce you cant shame people into liking youfinding you attractive and its pretty ironic coming from someone whos no doubt a complete sexual and real life loser and wont pass on his genes as for me im a young and healthy woman and i do plan to have children not interested in conceiving them with guys like you so you know at least theyll have a decent chance in life good luck
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh no his feelings c
PurplePillDebate,removed,the poster was banned
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah the people here on both sides of the spectrum are fucking retards
PurplePillDebate,removed,lbfm
PurplePillDebate,removed,that goes for every subreddit silly boy welcome to a forum
PurplePillDebate,removed,im here to promote the idea of assisted suicide for incels true there are some false incels who can genuinely become attractive in society and they can benefit from a little coaching and therapy these are what i call the lazy betas but some others are really terrible i actually feel sorry for them they are functionally intelligent enough to be aware of their situation yet every time they attempt some selfimprovement they hit a plateau and cant go further im not just talking about physical appearance but also social skills there is something off about how they respond to social stimuli and they know it but cant do anything about it it affects their romantic aspirations and professional ambitions they cant find or keep a job for long or they find themselves in low level positions never to be considered for promotion it feels like drowning where youre aware that all you need is a breath of fresh air but youre only filling your lungs with water and youre unable to find the surface to these true incels truecels im really not against the idea of assisted suicide from organizations like dignitas ive seen a few videos of terminally ill but fully conscious and aware patients willingly swallow a cocktail of barbiturates fall asleep and slowly drift to their death true incels may not be terminally ill in a physical sense but they certainly are from a mental sense anyone care to discuss the treatment of incels with me
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre right but i dont know why ask your great great great great great great great great great great grandchildren why
PurplePillDebate,removed,id say most do
PurplePillDebate,removed,this thread is an awesome example of trp projection fantasy i like it therefore everyone must like it well played op
PurplePillDebate,removed,im bp and i went through an anger phase in college i was recently dumped heartbroken and couldnt figure out what i was doing wrong it was easy to get girlfriends in hs and suddenly i wasnt as successful it was frustrating the key difference is that i didnt blame my failures on women i realized that people were growing up and expecting different things and that i wasnt even achieving what i wanted so i decided to change
PurplePillDebate,removed,i feel bad for any low esteem girl who tries to be a trooper for an unskilled man
PurplePillDebate,removed,your situation is making me question my atheism if there is a divine intelligence this is exactly what it would want for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,phase i like to think of it as my new reality hatred of women fags niggers kikes fatties and libcucks is what keeps me going i think about the spread of globalismmulticulturalism it helps me squeeze out a few more reps the strongest civilizations were all founded on a healthy core of hate and disdain for those who failed to meet the standards of straight white patriarchal men i simply carry that legacy forward
PurplePillDebate,removed,shes a post wall woman whos attracted to truly alpha men thats probably the sort of thing shes getting at i have never seen her advocate abuse and this is coming from somebody who disagrees with the prescriptive parts of rpwi
PurplePillDebate,removed,arguments involving generalization of a group is almost always a logical fallacy
PurplePillDebate,removed,tell that to some rpillers
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you think people who support refugees are also doing it because they want to fuck refugees or people who are supporters of animal rights are doing it because they want to fuck animals
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah im sure you can rant for days about the cruel injustice of msha safety regulations i cant believe ill be denied that now please come back tell me all about how soft power and an exit strategy is for suckers
PurplePillDebate,removed,and im saying youre coming across as the kind of guy who thinks supply side economics are a thing and who reads atlas shrugged all in a single sitting first through tears and then through a lot of fist pumping i cant take anyone seriously who doesnt understand why high heels which have nothing to do with the ability to perform the job and may even hinder it a handicap only half the employees need to deal with for very arbitrary reasons are an issue you simply have no concept of professionalism that hasnt been handed down to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a moron im moving on your worldview is exceotionally naive
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive turned down sex a few times when i just didnt find the woman that physically attractive in a couple of other cases i was looking for an ltr so i refused casual sex only to change my mind later when they redoubled their efforts and we came to an understanding then there was a freaky incident in high school when the quiet girl turned into a raging nymphomaniac and i decided that was not how i wanted to lose my virginity however that goes beyond the parameters of the discussion at hand
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,uh no ah now i get it there never was foreverunwantedwomen there is fa faw fu a sub for the women that are struggling just as much as the guys at fu no such women and no such sub lol you know that i was making fun of ifeellikeiamfas here my boyfriend has brown hair but i secretly prefer blonde guys and feel unfulfilled alone in the universe
PurplePillDebate,removed,if i had to define my colour i would say black pill when the mood strikes i harass a woman when she identifies herself as such on reddit on fatype subreddits establishing someones gender is easier also lately ive been hanging out there more so for anybody to whom i personally sent a hate message who might be reading this this has nothing to do with the fa part and everything to do with the w part
PurplePillDebate,removed,thebluepillsrs links to rmgtow every day but we dont give a shit and the people linking to us are notorious for brigading doxxing and harassing members we simply ignore the progressive and intellectual brigade or even laugh at them grow a backbone for goodness sake
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am not a rapist i have nothing to apologise for if this triggers you you belong in a mental asylum thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,or maybe you should learn to read
PurplePillDebate,removed,this was written in it seems to me that women are the safety valve for the survival and propagation of the species by refusing to mate with low level betas and those unfortunate enough to be born with physical or mental handicaps or even just born less attractive than others if only this were true if a woman is going to bear children she will not bear children of the alpha fucks but rather the beta bucks she finds postwall if anything women are only adding fuel to the fire
PurplePillDebate,removed,the problem with all this is that subtly implies that the opposite is bad for example that people who prefer traditional gender roles or want to be a stayathome mother are wrong that people who value fitness are vain that people who hold religious beliefs are ignorant the problem with intolerance is that it depends on who is doing the defining accepting one thing as normal entails the covert rejection of another as abnormal accepting one set of beliefs as good entails the covert rejection of another as bad doing so in reverse does not change the process it only changes the target when you say tolerance you merely mean tolerating things you agree with
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think most people are cool with feminism as equality but what you are describing isnt third wave feminism when people talk about the patriarchy or rape culture they are singling out men as evil violent rapists who are out to subvert all women there is nothing about equality there i think what you are describing is acceptable to most people but the problem is that feminism isnt being advanced by people who hold those beliefs the radicals are at the wheel now
PurplePillDebate,removed,i remember one of the posts i saw last year was a girl who went to a male model show and was amazed how she finally found a guy physically attractive in addition there were several posts of women who talked about feeling miserable and alone even though they were married and there were also several posts about fwb not committing overall what i took away from it is that they do not count attention from guys below a certain threshold and that threshold is significantly higher than their own smv i think fa women are the same type of women who spend years on one dating website trying to find a guy who ticks every single one of their boxes but then they also want to be victims at the same time
PurplePillDebate,removed,the only thing wrong with feminism is use of government force to accomplish its ends and use of government funds to pay for its consequences otherwise who cares go ahead be a feminist lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,these questions are all hard to answer because there was no conversation to derail in the link i think its ironic that a woman who gets angry i treat her a certain way because in my experience of women share a certain trait would feel justified in treating me as a potential rapist because of men are rapists
PurplePillDebate,removed,feel like im invisible to the opposite sex i know that feel you know being male
PurplePillDebate,removed,what qualifies as not conventionally attractive a woman an overweight woman a woman who looks like she escaped from a concentration campbut if shes pretty she can make it work a woman who is ugly a woman who has stingy hair or simply a woman who is not remarkable to look at those women are not conventionally attractive what are conventionally attractive women blonde with with a pretty face fit bodies and who can dress and act in a feminine fashion yes people tend to enter into relationships with people of equal smv because they cant get better than that as soon as an average looking man has the smv or the money to fuck hot girls thats what he does just look at mick jagger one of the ugliest and skinniest faggots to grace the planet and he fucked more models than many guys who actually are fucking good looking
PurplePillDebate,removed,the problem i have is that i cannot think of a single legal issue where women are negatively impacted there are several when men are significantly impacted yet for all of their bullshit about equality for all by crushing the patriarchy i have yet to see a single psa telling women to stop abusing their husbands or dont make false rape accusations or making women compete fairly with men to get jobs or into stem courses instead it seems quite the opposite they are pushing for women to support rape accusers regardless of evidence they are still pushing that men should treat their women wonderfully this is how a real man treats a woman women shouldnt have to compete with men to get a job it should just be handed to them regardless if they are less qualified than a man to do the job there is so much media pushing women to go into stem and were legislating the shit out of colleges making it easier for women to try and get more women into stem at the expense of men who work their asses off to get into stem
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,i can see that you have no interest in honest debate i find it ironic that you claim to want an honest debate while simultaneously downvoting every response i give you
PurplePillDebate,removed,used to be amazing at it gave up masturbating in my teens for like years was horny as fuck and ended up cumming randomly because i was so pent up and frustrated which was when i began to think this is unnatural and disgusting what im doing
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean if anything they just like making fun of weak men there is only one post actually even in reference to trp on their front page the rest is posts about incels and asktrp stuff
PurplePillDebate,removed,i just completely destroyed that post please upvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,apples and oranges sweetheart
PurplePillDebate,removed,dumb ass fucked up reasoning go fuck each other then with your nasty dicks since were so fuckin alien to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,check out our conversation then she revealed to me in the past that she isnt below body fat
PurplePillDebate,removed,keep my name out of your mothafuckin mouth i am not even close to fat
PurplePillDebate,removed,its really difficult to use enough words to give context that you can follow while simultaneously using few enough words to keep your attention

PurplePillDebate,removed,im not fat shut the fuck up
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont want you bitch xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,it was a joke idiot
PurplePillDebate,removed,

PurplePillDebate,removed,artists poets musicians and generally all kinds of empathetic sensitive and artsy guys those guys constantly have sex and several plates but somehow they dont exist in trp land because they arent masculine muscle mass
PurplePillDebate,removed,arent you an incel lol ew xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,teleports behind you nothing personal kid
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are a sad person
PurplePillDebate,removed,please go to your local bar this weekend you need to get laid
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not about me i answered a question with my opinion you obviously have an issue with women having high sex drives perhaps it has to do with your personal experience with women sorry youve had trouble with this but there is always backpage good luck
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats his only choice xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,passing tests doesnt make you smart
PurplePillDebate,removed,too bad i didnt say that lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,let me define this for you is equal to lbs not people and yes i know women based that they weigh an average of who have told me their intimate details since friends talk about that you werent using it to refer to a weight you were using it hyperbolicly to refer to a lot is not a lot so assumed a ridiculously large number to prove that even if you were serious about your hyperboleit still wouldnt amount to shit and then you went ahead and said no i dont know i know you just proved my point and then said my comments are bullshit and then tried to pull on of those phaggy maybe if i pretend im done with this argument i can lie to myself that ive won maneuvers jesus christ youre a sad sack
PurplePillDebate,removed,they need to make sure they are setting fire to the right strawman
PurplePillDebate,removed,ooh ooh trpers do it too
PurplePillDebate,removed,im trying to make a point get this chaff out of here
PurplePillDebate,removed,chaff noun worthless things trash
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow youre misogynistic as fuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,being my rp mysoginist hateful self is going swimmingly i guess we can agree on this one
PurplePillDebate,removed,im manipulating this keyboard right now abuse misogyny
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a pretty shrill whiner bet thats marked pronounced and shocking to the chicks you bang lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,then mockery is the sincerest form of insult facepalm
PurplePillDebate,removed,disclosure my wife is the definition of happiness and wouldnt have me any other way sorry that your ex couldnt follow a guide try growing up before looking for a meaningful relationship
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is an immature coping mechanism that we grow out of as we proceed through adolescence this explains your whole comment
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you need to write a blog post to explain a word advice maybe your advice isnt that good or detailed enough
PurplePillDebate,removed,what the hell are you on about
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course you do that is why we dont take your advice
PurplePillDebate,removed,then go and find one from a good family that gave her some morals along the way
PurplePillDebate,removed,so there is woman a that has a problem with trps negative view on women and then there is woman b that is a radfem that has shitty opinions about men just because a and b are both women doesnt mean that they are the same person there is no hypocrisy there might be some overlap but they are still individual people the a women probably complain about the b women as well but you just dont see it happening as often its like saying why are there blacks protesting white cops killing black men when there are blacks out there killing white cops
PurplePillDebate,removed,pem this is not complex stuff keep up youre just being obtuse to be a shit about it and if you truly do not understand fine ill explain and use small words so you can follow along at your slow pace first you tell them they suck they do thats why they came to rp but they still need to be themselves they are even worse if they try to fake alpha or play pretend that they are chad to be healthy in this life you do need to be yourself to go through life in the closet or playing a role is unhealthy and a miserable way to live then in literally the same breath you tell them they need to change when you say commit to getting better no shit or should they just continue sucking at life if they suck they need to change right yet youre still telling them they need to be themselves of course they need to change what they are doing is not working what they do not need to do is the fake alpha bullshit instead of being a better version of themselves im talking about self improvement which necessitates change but it does not mean that you lose yourself along the way you improve yourself you dont abandon yourself get it now
PurplePillDebate,removed,great just the way you are dont change dont improve you dont need to improve if you do any of that self improvement stuff youll no longer be you and just be you yes people do say exactly this people have told me this in precisely those words just be yourself is not unambiguous especially since i have taken the time to explain very clearly what i mean by the phrase who gives a shit what you mean by that phrase seriously dont try to help men
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure life is ambiguous but theres good advice and bad advice good advice should be clear and unambiguous to a novice whos never done this shit before so you dont tell a beginner whos just going out there to just be yourself no good advice does not mean you have to sit and think good advice is clear admits of one and only one meaning and can be easily understood and applied youre still not getting it again you really shouldnt try to help men youve shown you really cant do it
PurplePillDebate,removed,no thats not what it means if people dont understand your advice and it gets debated endlessly it means your advice is shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,all things being the same rich obviously generally speaking i prefer the company of poor people though
PurplePillDebate,removed,hahahhaah the overpopulation problem sorry im not part of your universalist anti human leftist religion n that phrase has no reality to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop reading my comments be a virgin i dont care
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,poor
PurplePillDebate,removed,which is being a shitty lay if all that matters is your pleasure just jerk off and dont bother involving someone else if you cant be bothered to respect them lol dont you use your brain in this one if all that matters is his pleasure shouldnt he do what brings him more pleasure in which case vaginamouth own had obviously
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes absolutely sex drive is regulated by hormones and the main one responsible testosterone coincidentally happens to be the thing males have so damn much of i used to have the male range of hormone balance and i thought that my sexual drive is average masturbating a day on average and thinking of sexual scenarios several times throughout the day small interactions with females would solicit random lewd thoughts and distracting erections out of nowhere were a fairly common occurrence nbsp once i switched to a female hormonal range my sexual drive went way down i can easily go a week without thinking of sex if i wanted to erections never happen unless i consciously think about arousing stuff its like this constant background noise of sexual thoughts has been lifted i can literally feel the brain resources which have been freed nbsp women generally do not have a clue of what a male sex drive is like let alone a high sex drive if you want a better opinion just ask any ftm whos gone on hrt
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe its an evolved thing maybe the female mind is programmed not to comprehend the demonstrable facts of male sexuality there really is an enormous number of women who express disbelief at normal male sexuality women arent stupid so why the disconnect between obvious fact and acceptance of that fact maybe failure to see male sexuality as it is conferred some kind of survival benefit in ancient times and this is the legacy who knows
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe thats what should happen
PurplePillDebate,removed,no i dont care to speak to you anymore and am blocking you
PurplePillDebate,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwkjxfjfcrca
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound like a woman getting upset because you felt like i was talking to you i dont want to bang of women not even close cool story bro please dont project your own lack of standards onto every other man in the world or what you gonna get emad
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a generalization thats completely unfounded though on what evidence do you base your assumption on nothing at all of course like all the rest of the hot air and bombast blasted by trp all youre doing is taking your own subjective experience which in your case seems to involve depressingly low standards and assuming because you are a narrowminded narcissist that what you personally experience must be generally true arrogant
PurplePillDebate,removed,you grow increasingly pathetic
PurplePillDebate,removed,it would do you some good to loosen up
PurplePillDebate,removed,well shes obviously the special snowflake
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre still saying this retarded shit after what i told sigh i have to apologize i had no idea you have down syndrome
PurplePillDebate,removed,so my child youre new here welcome to planet earth enjoy the ride
PurplePillDebate,removed,ouch you got me
PurplePillDebate,removed,you mad
PurplePillDebate,removed,ha ha you definitely are not a sexydude but you are intermittently amusing
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck off cunt and when youre sorry precious conceited little ass has finished feeling butthurt and issued some pathetic supposedly rulebased explanation for banning me come back and fuck off some more
PurplePillDebate,removed,she is not more chances are that she is post wall post wall women generally seek a submissive emotional beta so they can manipulate the shit out of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes saltiness plays the biggest factor in it
PurplePillDebate,removed,shaming language doesnt work around here feminist but do continue
PurplePillDebate,removed,which of these things does not serve the fi ask yourself that question and you have answered your question despite what all these people say young girls very young girls are more than happy to fuck a much older guy they still try to get your commitment as well this creates a threat to old women because the man who is serving as their tool can leave for a younger better model so women seek to shame men into compliance with the fi and use their disgusting loser betafag orbiters as additional ammunition
PurplePillDebate,removed,and are those feminists the majority of the population nope so youve not provided a valid counterargument no dumbass and it doesnt need to be a majority are isis a majority in your world i guess theyre totally ineffective and only exist on the internet youre dumb af dude your drug dealers gave you rat poison i think because your brain is donezo
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive actually never been with an older woman i wonder if they are a lot better in bed than the younger ones but i suppose theres lots of chicks in their who havent had many partners or women in their that had a lot of partners but somehow never got to get good at it are they any less dramatic than the younger girls lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,all the things you just described op can be attributed to any man nice or otherwise how is this specifically a niceguy experience
PurplePillDebate,removed,hahahaha youre all lunatics
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont know any women period
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you saying a man who never had a pussy except yours and never gets sexually validated gets a pussy and dint turn it down d surprised also it might have something to do with you not treating him better or like you treat alpha men too maybe you have been taking him for granted not being sexually explorative with him i am not saying those kind of men dont cheat just saying they cheat lesser and actually lesser options to do it too even a women has more options than a similar smv man in his early usually those kind of men when they get a pussy they try to keep it and worship it but i think times are changing maybe he has turned red pill without knowing about rp that sounds like a mans normal response to hypergamy and female centric sexual market i expect more and more loyal men to go unloyal given tge situation
PurplePillDebate,removed,hows it race baiting also thats kind of the point when its a cmv isnt it
PurplePillDebate,removed,but no one is going to do that fee feeeees
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not my reality this is not personal christ arguing with you female brained trps is like arguing with little bp girls sometimes it is reality human reality across time and culture
PurplePillDebate,removed,he should maim all chads
PurplePillDebate,removed,thanks for the lecture pastor im sure your imaginary audience of trps enjoyed it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i generally dont give out an exact location online but im in the us
PurplePillDebate,removed,my view is women dont understand how their own sex drive works very well arent you a selfdescribed incel you know jack shit about women
PurplePillDebate,removed,did you pick up a dumbbell yet you couldve done sets of curls in the time it took to write this
PurplePillDebate,removed,reported for personal attacks typical
PurplePillDebate,removed,read what you just said your making a claim about my level of personal experience thats a personal attack are you that ignorant
PurplePillDebate,removed,my observation is that youre a woman and an angry one at that
PurplePillDebate,removed,fucking quote your fucking sources
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is true about the nth time you have a ons with a woman who just hours ago declared i dont sleep with guys on the first date you kinda stop believing what women say or girls who cheat on their bf with you but dont consider themselves the cheating type irl i just nod and say unh huh but in my mind it all goes into the yeah right ill believe it when i see it category
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not my fault if you have trouble understanding my logical arguments
PurplePillDebate,removed,the main trp sub is crawling with noobs and the rise of trump has distracted guys like roissy from posting evo psych i dont think rollo posts actively that much anymore
PurplePillDebate,removed,evopsych is the greatest hamster wheel in academia this kind of bullshit wishful romanticism regarding our ancient origins is prevalent into as well there are tons of back and forth theories just trying to answer the question of why we began to walk upright for instance the very worst of these theories just like most of the evopsych rp likes to quote suffer for the same key defect little to no hard evidence sure they are cute little selfreinforcing models but they do not hold up to honest scientific examination debunking of the paleo diet is another example of this same tendency we have to want to romanticize our hominid past into some sort of action movie awesomeness evopsych is just more of this crap
PurplePillDebate,removed,ya know that makes a lot of sense women have maternal instinct after all while men maybe not as much as for men being on either one aide of the scale or the other i think men and women cluster almost the same but men tend to be super mean ight off the bat while women are aomehwta more likely to pretend to be nice even though heyre rotten on the inside but tbh i think those super fake women are very low in numbers ive met only a small handful of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,all these flavours and you had to be salty
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have no idea what youre rambling about
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre sick
PurplePillDebate,removed,always upvote ray
PurplePillDebate,removed,so so weak man you are absolutely never ever going to be a nice guy unless you rape her
PurplePillDebate,removed,rape or murder por que no los dos
PurplePillDebate,removed,first off you guys use anecdotes all the fucking time pfft everyone knows their anecdotes are certified red pill biotroofstm and ours are feminazitm lies designed to create cuckolds
PurplePillDebate,removed,uwolfsouls is the funniest insane woman i have ever met do you ever cringe so hard that you involuntarily chuckle well i just went through her comment history and it had that effect on me
PurplePillDebate,removed,my body doesnt work like other peoples do ah in that case forgive me for taking a bipolar hooker seriously
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is creepy behaviour in a man there is no such thing as creepy behavior at least not given the world of safe spaces and fee fees reals that we live in today creepiness today is basically just a function of whether you are a top male or not i have heard women call guys creepy simply for standing in their vicinity say while they wait in line or are ordering a coffee etc even though the guy is doing absolutely nothing isnt even looking in their direction his only flaw being that he isnt a top male on the flipside ive seen girls swooon over guys who are openly making rather disgusting sexual remarks to strangers to most women those guys arent creepy and could never be because they are top males in short creepy is basically a word a woman will redefine at her leisure and use whenever she wants to justify her derogatory treatment of a human male
PurplePillDebate,removed,sexual remarks without knowing you or having spoken to you at all the idea being that the woman will redefine what she considers inappropriate sexual remarks given whether the guy is a top guy or not ive seen women think that a guy was being creepy simply for standing near them in line to get a coffee simply because the guy wasnt an adonis while the same women think that a random but hot guy walking up to them in that same line saying how he wants to x her y in an inappropriate manner is perfectly acceptable women pretend that their is consistency in their behavior but in such matters everything ive observed shows that the only consistent thing is their inconsistency that and how they all react when shown their inconsistency
PurplePillDebate,removed,how am i stopping women answering your question or are you just getting your feathers ruffled because youd rather hear someone reinforce your biased viewpoints rather than have an honest discussion yea thanks for proving my point this one specifically at least not given the world of safe spaces and fee fees reals that we live in today and as for your comment i think theyd know better than a male i think its basic and crass for you to suggest that im ignorant simply because i have a penis thanks for displaying your bias though xd if you think that only women should be allowed to speak then i dont know what you are doing in a discussions subreddit this isnt a feminist subreddit the idea here isnt to cry rape and demand censorship everytime you hear an opinion that you dont like lol so basic
PurplePillDebate,removed,acting completely normal and being unattractive its actually the only real reason the others uthatgreeklady came up with are only there to cover up the real reason ive seen women call a guy creepy simply for standing within their eyeline ive seen women call a guy creepy simply for not giving them exactly what they want eg a girl demands a guy buy her a drink mainly because she thinks he is ugly and will fall at the chance to have any female contact he says no he is immediately branded creepy
PurplePillDebate,removed,were they really young girls nah id say probably late early
PurplePillDebate,removed,a good question with an answer perhaps beyond the scope of this particular discussion but i would be willing to agree to any conventional definition of honor this includes things like fairness sacrifice this is a big one selflessness and so on basically the same thing you think of when you think of honorable people in history those who gave up their lives or comforts for greater causes i mean there is a reason society silently or how if a man doesnt willingly wish to his manhood itself is called into question absolutely no such expectations exist today for women
PurplePillDebate,removed,your statistics have nothing to do with honor in women or even in men aggression and honor are not immiscible in fact the wartime roots of honor make the two ideas completely complimentary that said what you are trying to do is an example of a httpsenwikipediaorgwikistrawman since you are trying to suggest that the existence of violence precludes the existence of honor in men but the strawman is that we are talking about the lack of honor in women however since you like posting stats that are irrelevant let me show you an example of statistics that actually do have to do with the topic at hand httpiimgurcomrlzyyujpng so yea nice try at deraildeception but we are discussing the lack of honor in women and it has already been established that honor and violence can coexist since honor was actually born from violence
PurplePillDebate,removed,no where even close to the rates at which men sacrifice for humanity as a whole women and children and elderly there is a reason when a ship is sinking that the universally accepted phrase is women and children first
PurplePillDebate,removed,its just that fat sweaty and nervous guys you literally just proved my point that a guy simply has to exist without enacting any action to be considered creepy you try to qualify that by excusing the behavior of the woman who is thinking a guy is creepy simply for existing but that doesnt actually negate my point it reinforces it especially the part where you scramble to justify why women are right in thinking guys are creepy simply for existing
PurplePillDebate,removed,simply because women are more adaptive and change their minds more easily we are in agreement then you call this simply women being women which is actually a perfect example of the women can do no wrong and are justified in everything they do point i made earlier funnily enough the simple existence of this social fact is the most glaring example of the lack of honor in women since how can you be honorable if you change your position to whatever benefits you most but yes you call this women just being women i call it a perfect example of the toolbox of manipulation that said as far as sacrifice and honor is concerned i think they are definitely intertwined but then again we can discuss the intricate nature of honor itself in another thread since while i dont fully agree with how you define it i think our ideas on it match enough for them not to hamper further discussion
PurplePillDebate,removed,a lot of women are criticized for their actions especially in more traditionalist societies perhaps true in more patriarchal societies where womens manipulative nature is heavily policed but in the western world which no doubt impacts all of us more frequently this is certainly not the case there are entire institutions and laws that protect a womans right to do whatever she wants without any kind of repercussion there is just too much evidence to show that the pussypass is a real thing
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are a little late to the party so ill do a quick recap for you please define honor i recommend using game theory or evolutionary psychology as ive already mentioned elsewhere in this thread this thread is not a debate about the definition of honor as said earlier i welcome and accept most normal definitions of honor which most other folks in this thread seem fine with too whatever your concept of honor is ill prob be fine with it im less concerned about defining honor but i can understand how it is usually the first point of contention when someone is attempting to construct a strawman argument why didnt the dishonorable win wouldnt it be best to exhibit a strategy of honor among allies but extreme dishonor towards enemies why not betray your weaker allies to the stronger enemy to get ahead if you are attempting to discuss whether honor even exists or how it came about then you are lacking in history this thread is not a history lesson but if your major point of contention with my post is that you dont believe being honorable exists in war then i turn your attention to some of the oldest agreements made between nations in history these were agreements about how to conduct honorable warfare eg letting your enemy take their dead after battle giving proper burial rights to enemy falled etc these agreements and laws of warfare have existed since the time of hammurabi the giver of law but again this is just another attempt to strawman the discussion we are not talking about history in this thread dont make it sound like a conspiracy the women are wonderful effect is a widely recognized social phenomenon did you bother to follow the link provided responding to that link with oh your making it a conspiracy is only indicating the lack of good faith by which you are conducting yourself in this discussion please follow the links before you comment on them now theres true honor beyond honor whats the difference again it seems like you just didnt bother to read the sentence that followed the one you quoted i describe the difference between the two rather clearly one is selective honor where you act honorable since it furthers your agenda the other is true honor which is a constant state the more and more i engage your post the more i sense you are not here to debate in good faith since you are purposely misrepresenting my position how do you prove who has honor over who doesnt by observing inconsistency of behavior if you are honorable when it serves you but dishonorable when it doesnt just a single incidence of that is proof of the claim womens social order the same dishonorable backstabbing succubi banding together to collectively tear done the honorable and just patriarchy of good men and proper order yep its clear to me now that you are just a troll to reiterate my previous comment the more and more i engage your post the more i sense you are not here to debate in good faith since you are purposely misrepresenting my position
PurplePillDebate,removed,studies show that in actual maritime disasters again we are not discussing actual maritime disasters for my point the simple fact that women and children first is actually a thing is enough it seems you are more concerned about attacking the analogies i am making rather than my points that said even though it doesnt even have anything to do with the thread i followed your links and those studies you linked are exceptionally suspect and deeply debated mainly since their application of the scientific method is being brought into question but again the real point i am making is the existence of the social norm in the first place which is enough to add weight to the expectation of men to sacrifice for women no such expectation exists of women that is the point being made
PurplePillDebate,removed,youve explicitly framed this argument by comparing honor in men vs honor in women nope i didnt you are now trying to tell me what i made this thread for this is the thread women have no honor since they have never had to develop it for you to you have to show how and where women have honor by saying men have no honor they are all rapists you dont actually address the point being made its like me making a thread saying peter has no shoes and you responding with oh but mark has no shoes either when in order to really cmv you should be saying actually peter also has shoes coz i saw him wearing a pair etc etc the lack of shoes for mark is a not what we are discussing b has no bearing on whether peter has shoes your argument is a picture perfect example of a strawman
PurplePillDebate,removed,if a man can be honorable while raping and murdering he cannot nowhere has anyone besides you even mentioned that or even insinuated it but the simple fact that your frustration has lead you to reduce the discussion to such a disgusting and basic statement means you have nothing further to contribute to the discussion thanks and good day
PurplePillDebate,removed,well creepy is the vibe you get from people that give off a dangerous aura again as i mentioned before you are actually making my point the point being that it does not matter what you actually do but that your simple existence is enough to class you as creepy your whole talk of dangerous aura or whatnot is the actual manifestation of my point as an aside its still not a justification for thinking someone is creepy so yea again i think you might not realize that you are actually echoing my point to make it simpler imagine we are trying to answer the following question does a guy need to actually do anything to be considered creepy both you and i will answer no since he could be standing there in line waiting to order a coffee thinking about bunny wabbits but be giving off a vibe and can be considered creepy that is the exact point im making too the creepy guy in the example doesnt actually have to do anything he simply needs to exist
PurplePillDebate,removed,even when it is manifestly clear that no actual penalty attaches itself to men who flout such an expectation you cant be serious no penalty i would say death is a pretty severe penalty again httpiimgurcomrlzyyujpng are you forgetting the droves of men who die every minute for the safety of civilization hmm its disturbing that you have such a view of male disposability so yea if you think that men are killing themselves for women simply because then yea we are at an impasse since the entire wealth of history is chock full of examples of men dying for the honorable thing heck entire civilizations and societies have been setup to nurture that view eg both ancient and modern japan so yea i think your view of reality is too skewed for us to move forward the simple fact that you think there is no expectation for men to die for women is just too far from reality for the scope of this discussion
PurplePillDebate,removed,how did your comment contribute to the discussion outside of making you feel better for sending me an insult
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre entertaining do go on
PurplePillDebate,removed,people give off vibes during social interactions expressions body language etc that we kind of expect people to pick up on most do and this nonvocal communication allows us to get through our day like when i am on a plane and pull out my book and put in headphones i do not want to chat when i smile and give one word answers at work i dont want to chat when i have headphones in at the gym please leave me alone people who are going to be violent towards you ignore those little barriers so when people start to ignore those barriers or polite cold shoulders we automatically associate it with danger physical danger like a person who knocks on your door and just walks right into your house without invitation no one would think that is cool most people would be thrown into a physical response fight or flight and a few people would outright attack someone who violated their personal space like that being creepy activates those same feelings not picking up on those signals to stop or that she is not interested invasion of personal space fight or flight activated
PurplePillDebate,removed,what the red pill does not understand is that dating life does not magically get easier for lame guys who are now in their if anything it gets more difficult the answer is simple dont be a lame guy this advice fixes all dating problems regardless of age
PurplePillDebate,removed,women are evil because they despise innocence and admire darkness
PurplePillDebate,removed,because the red pillers is wrong women and men age equally rather shittly human beings reach their equinox in beauty at around the age of over that its downhill the vast majority of year old men do not have what it takes to attract hot young women no one is attracted to old people and a year old man is old past his prime years ago he would have been considered a very ancient man
PurplePillDebate,removed,what a horrible world view you must be female rape is not sex men that commit rape dont do it for sex they do it for power because they feel powerless most of the time the only difference between attractive and unattractive rapists is that attractive men have the ability to get dates and unattractive rapists rarely do this assertion that all men are willing to commit rape is a dangerous fiction stemming from the misandry displayed unapologetically in the mainstream media
PurplePillDebate,removed,and there are a bunch of lowstatus men in every other western country too but we almost never see mass rapes there because theyre not muslim thirdworlders lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,because they like to feel sorry for themselves as most people do so not demonising them as a group just calling this situation for what it is
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol muslims
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp is made up of conservative men by and large islam is by definition a conservative religion as op pointed out all of those conservative ideals regarding women are going to match up even across cultural boundaries islam has a lot in common with any largely conservative american institution including trp and nearly all american religions the differences are obviously significant but not where the treatment of women is concerned might as well call trp the american taliban when it comes to keeping your hoes in check
PurplePillDebate,removed,because red pillers are an inferior sub species i thought you already figured that out
PurplePillDebate,removed,your experience even if there are other men who share that experience of what other life could i be qualified to speak genius hostility aside no one can study this it is the same with what remains of racism no one outs themselves on racism but i assure you it exists in the same fervor based on my worthless experience im pretty sure you can submit complaints anonymously through hr in many situations you reveal some measure of ignorance in what you think hrs mission is theyre not on the side of employees they just want to keep the organization from being sued and no it is not my job to defend women i thought it was growing up protestant and male in a disney environment then i saw what the law and society did to selfsacrificial people like me you shit on your white knights and your honorable men you get trp deal with it based on how you use english i can already tell youre not the type to be persuaded by reason should i check my white guilt should i stop mansplaining what would you do with the easy button to kill all white men its sickening i get the sense that this discomfort is feigned id probably think otherwise if the comments displayed less arrogance about your own views you seek the halo affect darling it doesnt exist dont look for it men and women can be good at some things and bad at others the sooner you accept the fact the sooner you can understand humanity in a more complete way i get the sense that this discomfort is feigned id probably think otherwise if the comments displayed less arrogance about your own views call me a liar because of your feeling and in the same breath denounce that women shouldnt be called more emotional than men jesus i do look forward to informed young people but they wont be what you have in mind then tell me im wrong when the time comes if im still alive
PurplePillDebate,removed,still avoiding we dont give a fuck what you think youre the one arguing against the group convince us
PurplePillDebate,removed,you seriously called him a bigot after generalizing billions of peoples beliefs to womanbeating burkawearing terrorist youre an idiot
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre an idiot rp is definitely not limited to the west it is a worldwide set of beliefs on masculinity and the role women have in society
PurplePillDebate,removed,no i wasnt fuck me just go away you cant refute the idea bye
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop moving the fucking goalposts bp posters i never said it wasnt for income fuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,i say that the idea that you have to have incomes in order to raise a family otherwise its almost possible is wrong you say why do women work if not for income how the fuck does what i said imply anything like that im so over the goalpost moving lately they do it because they believe that its a better choice obviously the reasons for which is up to the individual i think that lots of people are insecure as fuck if they dont have the latest consumer bs but i cant speak for everyone i run a business charge have hours a week work on and drive a camry so im not part of the target group we are discussing but for fucks sake stop moving goalposts lefties
PurplePillDebate,removed,its all of ppd no one can make a point without the goalposts being moved im just way over it
PurplePillDebate,removed,this time i simply disagreed with a clear statement theres nothing ambiguous about that at all my comment literally said infact it is true that you can manage to raise a family on one income that isnt in the top nothing ambiguous at all there ive called out many people replying to other posters posts doing this and using intellectual dishonesty i might just make an account called goalpost bot and use it to get the mods into gear
PurplePillDebate,removed,no youre fat
PurplePillDebate,removed,which doesnt change the import of my point but you do make a good case for saying that overall bluepillers are intellectually incoherent
PurplePillDebate,removed,done
PurplePillDebate,removed,why cant i call leftists leftists they literally are politically left leaning why cant i call them what they are
PurplePillDebate,removed,depending on the state some laws do allow for nonconsensual sex lack of resistance consent for men or women thats a very bold claim that has to be proven first if feminists truly wanted to improve anything they would be improving those laws instead youre also going to need better reasoning than i dont trust feminists to argue your point thats not my reasoning dont pretend it is did i not write a multitude of reasons numbered and formatted for better understanding are you that pathetic
PurplePillDebate,removed,safe spaces for expressing anger at selected targets free from shame are completely different they swear a lot more
PurplePillDebate,removed,what a condescending sentiment great job
PurplePillDebate,removed,brilliant job sir
PurplePillDebate,removed,as someone who has negative karma on a few subreddits and hit the post cap reddit is a perfectly constructed system of circlejerking this is why everyone in this subreddit who uses the downvote button is a subhuman piece of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,what the fuck are you even doing here
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre sorry for what shouldnt you be on rsubredditdrama or riamverysmart or something
PurplePillDebate,removed,the wall just got ten feet taller

PurplePillDebate,removed,one week trial of new rules so these are official now leading questions on the front page right now if men are allowed financial abortions wouldnt the crime rate go up offtopic discussionwhat are your views on aliens bigfoot and the anecdotal evidence that supports them overly broad topics that have been beaten to death recently understanding the red pill invalidating do not tell another user directly that the opinion expressed by them is incorrect if a guy says i like a woman who can cook and clean do not respond by saying no you want a livein servant this happens in practically every thread where bluepillers refute redpillers and vice versa excessive posting uquestioningwoman uthatgreeklady
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey guess whats none of your business
PurplePillDebate,removed,the last thing someone should have time to do is as an unlicensed professional speculate wildly about the psychological state of someone youve never met
PurplePillDebate,removed,you didnt get the dms from the idiots who frequented the thread that you created dont come back dont give a fuck you wont be missed perhaps you experiences uses different platforms wouldnt be so unpleasant if you werent such a fucking tool
PurplePillDebate,removed,yea i kindve dont care take your false sympathetic concern somewhere else its none of your business he cast the first stone
PurplePillDebate,removed,im being plenty civil im allowed to express my discontent get over it there are no attacks i can say what i want
PurplePillDebate,removed,read my other reply thats completely unfounded i accused him of spreading rumors you all dont like it theres no inaccuracy there and its not hostile so again fuck off moderator
PurplePillDebate,removed,no rules have been broken so take your nosey power abusing elsewhere
PurplePillDebate,removed,nonconsensual washing not saying a word
PurplePillDebate,removed,he pressured her and coerced her into doing something she did not want to it is against her sexual integrity and she felt disgusting doing it honestly that jake guy sounds like a creepy person to do something like that he then kind of pulled me into the tub halfway that sounds sexy why are you in this fucking bathtub with this man when you repeatedly told him no she was probably scared ↓ rape apologists reply here ↓
PurplePillDebate,removed,lets hear another side of the story
PurplePillDebate,removed,my point exactly
PurplePillDebate,removed,yesterdays news isis burnt alive in iron cages yazidi women for refusing sex with isis fighters what has this got to do with it dont know perspective maybe you know women have babies once every none months max men about once a day max so we have evolved these diverging sexual strategies where men try to persuade and women tend to resist and social reality constrains women from being promiscuous even with birth control and there are expectations of a kind of play or good natured rivalry where the man will be active and the woman passive within this women will bring themselves to mens attention both generally by their appearance and in particular cases but then they get to play passive and test the man it is to their advantage that they can turn round and play innocent and so forth everyone knows the picture then some crass fembully comes along and cuts through all this by pretending its not happening nonconsensual what is that really so as the russian troops bore down on berlin in the closing days of world war two fear descended on the women of the ruined cityl they knew deep down what their country had done to the poles and the russians they knew what angry hatred would now repay these crimes rather than face the risk of rape by the invading army many committed suicide by drowning so seriously did they take the preservation of their honor this one were talking about on the other hand got herself in a bathtub with a guy she was flirting with and decided to do the selective not right now bit to his then come kiss me sweet and twenty but got to elevate it with the infamous im uncomfortable therefore you are a vile sadistic rapist who makes serialkilling relatively trivial move which actually makes feminism and the history of the sexual harassmentdate rape movement look like a trivial shit test in the history of sexual strategies how pathetic just leave the bathroom and stop complaining lets avoid intellectual honesty here in case it hurts our feelings or triggers victims we need safety behind a wall of dissembling s feminist culture endows women with this power and power corrupts in this case we see the unrestrained exercise of power creating as vastly dishonest a selfserving ideology as anything feminism ever complained of in men
PurplePillDebate,removed,owned
PurplePillDebate,removed,we get it youve had bad experiences with love
PurplePillDebate,removed,victim blaming
PurplePillDebate,removed,ah it all makes sense figured you for a psychopath youre just old and bitter
PurplePillDebate,removed,what other problems that can arise in a relationship if im getting sex aplenty from her and no one else than what possible problem can there be youre not making any sense you sound like her
PurplePillDebate,removed,keep your legs open and your mouth closed and maybe your presence wont become unbearable
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wouldnt date a man who expects me to support him so i dont think it would be a problem for me we would both have our own jobs and contribute to the finances you could also gauge if hes a loyal person in general like whether hes cheated before or has friendships that have lasted many years
PurplePillDebate,removed,be civil
PurplePillDebate,removed,look im sorry if i sound bitter but i am enjoy your happy life me im miserable and the only thing i can think to do is save other men from my misery so thats what im going to do
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists pretty much exclusively oppose shared custody for men every time such a bill comes to a vote they lobby against it they claim that forcing women in to a caretaker role is oppressive and they oppose that but every action they make on this front is to jealously guard this oppression in reality they recognize the power being seen as the caretaker for children grants women in society and they have no interest in losing that
PurplePillDebate,removed,most men also dont ask to pay child support yet nobody cares because its in the childs best interest having a father who can put in a veto when important decisions are made like relocating far away from him is benefitial to a child and therefor shared custody should be the default and a partner should have to file for sole custody and present very important reasons why they should get it respectively why it should be revoked from the other parent
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow she probably eats to comfort herself for having an asshole for a husband
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes trp is creepy as all hell and a hell of a lot of that is because of the amoral nature of trp there are no ethics at all there no sense of caring for society its just set shit on fire its cold out there it could be a hell of a lot less creepy and noxious if it taught guys how to get women and social status without fucking shit up as they went
PurplePillDebate,removed,spoken like a true slut
PurplePillDebate,removed,however then you believe shes just another sinister lying woman because she doesnt agree with you about made up rape accusations no i dont believe shes lying when she states that she doesnt believe women are better people she probably genuinely thinks that doesnt however her belief dont qualify as such shes like the im not racist butpeople and yes if you seriously think that only of all rape accusations are made up a claim that has been debunked you are for all intents and purposes operating under the assumption that women are better people because you think its more likely that theres a pervasive patriarchal conspiracy where men rape women and male judges and male cops help covering it up and let them go unpunished while you dismiss with the possibility that women could be so heinous to make up a claim thats oftentimes mere interpretation is easy to make and hard to disprove and usually goes unpunished even if it is disproved and therefore is as perfectly suited to destroy someones life as something can be and you do so with a nearabsolute certainty heaven forbid their disagreement is based in fact based research more knowledge of the topic and different life experience you should go to hell for lying right now the of all rape accusations are falseclaim is the most malevolent interpretation possible of the facts at hand which are of all rape claims can be qualified as maliciously madeup with absolute certainty ie the woman in question was basically caught redhanded its like saying of all rape accusations are false if the police and the courts are only able to prove that of them are true beyond any reasonable doubt the same goes for that stupid only of all rapes end with a convictionclaim lets face it a feminist statistic is just another name for a lie with numbers in it
PurplePillDebate,removed,so thats why your comment sounded sane
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre willing to throw your life away for something so meaningless youre either suicidal or not very smart
PurplePillDebate,removed,as a sexless not very muscular guy i do struggle with this i feel that i probably would have had some success with women by now if i was more muscular but every so often i open up about this to a female friend and they seem a bit baffled its simultaneously a bit frustrating and affirming
PurplePillDebate,removed,duh
PurplePillDebate,removed,the only trait that all heterosexual women like universally is height be tall or kill yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp attracts the socially marginalized and desperate guys doing average or better wont put up with the bs of trp to get laid or have relationships
PurplePillDebate,removed,no a slut is a woman who fucks random dudes and is super easy to fuck women defending slurs are either slurs themselves or retards
PurplePillDebate,removed,not being owned doesnt mean the woman sleeps with others youre being idiotic it means she can make her own decisions and the man can make his own decisions
PurplePillDebate,removed,u go gurl
PurplePillDebate,removed,you people what do you mean by that
PurplePillDebate,removed,the place isnt about understand women at all the world doesnt revolve around your vagina
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah right explained to you and got triggered what a tard
PurplePillDebate,removed,itt tbp totally forgets about their feelz based argument strategy
PurplePillDebate,removed,no good for me is that i have followed trp advice im my ltr is my ncount is around hers is much lower she claims if you count anyall sexual activity but all i really care is that its lower than mine you know how i know its lower than mine because shes and hasnt fucked a new guy every week since turning but she could have because thats how easy it is for women to get sex by is not an impossible number i was agreeing with you but youre a dick you can never know a womans true number all you can do is fuck as many as you can while you can
PurplePillDebate,removed,no offense but are you autistic i ask because you have constructed a hell of a strawman just because you dont own anyone doesnt mean that you cant enter into an agreement with them to be monogamous now you cant make them stick to it but you shouldnt be able to in the first place
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol mra
PurplePillDebate,removed,just ignore him hes just trying to provoke you thats his source of validation i wish i could feel that validated from other dudes p
PurplePillDebate,removed,ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
PurplePillDebate,removed,stonepimpletilists fucking nailed it there is literally no use of a woman who is career driven no use at all they wont even give you a proper bj when you ask them to theyll most likely be shit at nurturing or taking care of the children because all they think is how successful they want to be i say fuck that personally i find such women pathetic and i know it does sound bad but it is what it is id choose poor humble simple woman over career driven feminist any fucking day career driven are shit at what they are supposed to do what mother nature made them to do and that is just no use for a woman like that
PurplePillDebate,removed,rekt
PurplePillDebate,removed,stfu homophobe using slurs like that
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you find men breathing obnoxious
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes some chick walked up to me and asked me if she could take the chair at my table i sternly told her that i already have a boyfriend she got in a huff and stormed off i was almost raped but in the end got likes on instagram for the story so i got that going for me
PurplePillDebate,removed,it can be argued that being sexually attractive to a woman is sexually coercive
PurplePillDebate,removed,because i am a man my faculties of reason are more powerful than my emotional faculties it is actually the faculty of reason that allows men to commit suicide many times folded more than women the level of arrogance in your statements are frightening please remember to ask for help when you need it seriously we all have our own perspectives but i would envision that the countless number of male judges politicians cops priests men in power positions throughout the years have had similar views about mens so called superior faculties to handle abuse that you have now it is those men coupled with feminism that has brought as you called them pussyass men to their knees throughout the world i am guessing your superior level of reasoning is above caring about all of that though men and women are not the same but please get off your white horse and stop pretending men are superior to women mentally you have much to learn mr man
PurplePillDebate,removed,but but butawalt or something
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you going to provide an example or not because the example you provided didnt acknowledge that clearly literally every discussion does not support it theres no flaw and you havent supported any of your other claims so im not going to bother entertaining you anymore coward
PurplePillDebate,removed,did you cut and paste this from your school web site i had this training in college mandatory for greek life last i read trp recognizes a hard no like i can say leave me alone and if that doesnt work how about fuck off also dont drink drinks in three hours
PurplePillDebate,removed,we dont care to change your view especially since you dont even want to yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,l o l this thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre an idiot
PurplePillDebate,removed,well i got a lot of replies now if youre just gonna back handledly insult me gtfo and good night
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont feed the troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are you feeding the troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,generally speaking not really
PurplePillDebate,removed,id like to take this opportunity to thank birth control it has changed my life i have endometriosis a pretty mild form that causes me hell the first day of my cycle i am in about pain vomiting the works i cant leave my bed because of bc i havent had a period in months and its great besides some annoying acne best thing ever but i am tired of hearing about this study its been beaten to death
PurplePillDebate,removed,commentators lined up to mock weakwilled men for bailing on a trial its almost like women dont like weak men and women perpetuate toxic masculinity or something
PurplePillDebate,removed,to solve a problem one needs to identify the source women will never take responsibility for their dating choices so all of their advice is telling men that they arent worthy of a woman so they need to change themselves to fit their standards this is how the scam starts because a womans standards could be anything and everything so in the event that the man fails women can rehash the you lack personality garbage this ensures her ego is forever protected and the man continues to dig himself into a bigger hole
PurplePillDebate,removed,op is this a question for rp or a question for men youve got tagsflairs going which is confusing

PurplePillDebate,removed,do not listen to what this girl says she is the kind of girl who will post your picture on reddit and ridicule you into the ground if you dare to make a clumsy approach towards her royal highness
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont see any objectification anything undeniably creepy or anything contradicting feminism i mean of course an obnoxious feminist like you will find it problematic but to trump thats aok she is beautiful she is hot she is independent and no male exists good enough to be her captain
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course the woman has to evaluate if the man has actual significant resources before she is willing to overlook mismatched physical attractiveness aka income disparity they say that if you say it time in front of a mirror a gold digger will appear and divorce rape you

PurplePillDebate,removed,women not approaching you ≠ women never approaching men theyre interested in this isnt a real question and you just come off as bitter
PurplePillDebate,removed,i read a quote today that women are collectivist thinking while men are individualistic thinking ime this holds truth but of course napalt
PurplePillDebate,removed,one of the ways women are failing to adapt to the current smp is that are too empathetic and expect the same im not sure how much of it is natural and how much of it is socialized women have a twofold problem they try to be too nice and they pretend they are even nicer than that so they set this impossible standard of selfsacrifice and then go chasing after the standard people hold them to
PurplePillDebate,removed,what i dont get is why they minimize my feelings over how stressful this is being told about a problem and just having to sit there and listen while doing nothing produces a stress reaction in me but if i tell women that im the bad guy
PurplePillDebate,removed,all the lower average iq populations are increasing while the higher average iq populations are dwindling white europeans sounds like a recipe for disaster
PurplePillDebate,removed,the issue i see here is why do women feel entitled to have men bend entirely to the way the woman want to do things men and women process problems differently why is the man always expected to give up on his needs to cater to hers why not some give and take
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao the fact that you take the drooling pornaddict example so seriously you think it refers to you specifically says a lot about what your condition must be like women already have their careers sweetheart and you claim the tactic is not working anymore thats because you are a social misfit who has not walked into a restaurant to see men pick up the bills in a looooong time in fact i am afraid my last nights date is still susceptible to the evil womanly tactic booohooo
PurplePillDebate,removed,asians masterrace
PurplePillDebate,removed,because part of the underlying ideology informing a lot of red pill thought is fringe altright sentiments of building a nationalist powerhouse and this thread confirms it
PurplePillDebate,removed,question what would a fatherless woman do to get a credit card i know men were reluctant to give us our rights we dont give a shit we got what we wanted and nowadays women dont have to marry aspies like you to get resources tough
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck you sound like a real cunt to be around
PurplePillDebate,removed,i didnt say she was but this post sounds like thats what one would say i could say selfish and entitled sounding if you prefer which is fine so long as one isnt telling me about how i need to shape up and accommodate it
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you told people who didnt know what red pill was all ten would laugh it is absolutely a hate group but its also ironic that women make up of their conversations dont they have something manly or alpha to do i posted something with a genuine tone asking if feminism mens rights movements and other gender centric groups are counterintuitive or ironic partially as a test to see if they would be threatened by a woman standing up to them chuckle and my suspicion was confirmed they couldnt handle it and blocked me hehehe real tough blocking and even acknowledging a little woman who should be in the kitchen right heres the deal when you have real confidence you dont have to prove it to anyone leaders just lead they dont turn around to see if anyone is following alphas dont have to tell anyone theyre alpha everyone already knows it
PurplePillDebate,removed,holy shit youre dumber than i thought from a biological standpoint which is where youre basing your erroneous theory from attraction is nice but not required for reproduction are you trolling did you literally just say that gay people are gay by choice omfg what feminism does to brains sweet deflection brah but you left out my entire context you claimed that all men are attracted to the same thing in women i pointed out that some men arent attracted to women at all therefore youre wrong how the fuck did you interpret what i said in that way oh yeah youre an idiot none are unless its a kink youre not but you dont speak for all men youre not smart enough to speak for all men in no way does your preference change the fact that men are attracted to different things conventionally attractive isnt the sum total of what all men consider attractive preferences are a thing only uninteresting people share the same taste as everyone else no evidence of them being considered more attractive exists except the fact that they were the ones who were married and had all of the mistresses but sure go ahead and ignore history that should work out well for you that way you can cling to your false ideals you are still have no fucking clue what youre talking about dude i can guarantee that you and i are not attracted to the same type of girl physical attraction only goes so far the type of woman you want would be a fucking nightmare for me your match is a woman with nothing going for her besides being submissive and easily manipulated an idiot in other words kinda like you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am purple pill but ill answer this question women and men have great qualities and both have horrible qualities for example one of my friends is a woman who has won countless beauty contests yet instead of trying to live off her looks she works in the nonprofit field in order to protect the rights of children despite her appearance she is not a stuck up princess at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,if have to ask youl never know

PurplePillDebate,removed,id like to preemptively nominate any and all posts i may or may not make this week thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,honestly im not sure i can answer this question for you im an incel living at home during my gap year i rarely come in contact with any women my only interaction with them is reading what they have to say on reddit to me rejection has always been more of a cringe thing since im incompetent i suppose if an alpha was rejected he might go dark triad from my perspective of complete lack its depressing women arent celebrating they have constant opportunities to get slammed by virile agressive men society has separated the weak men and given them diversions such as comics culture or weed to spend there time on in bitter solitude
PurplePillDebate,removed,women like to harbor attention via dramatising things
PurplePillDebate,removed,men can be frightening theyre stronger and bigger than me thats right honey at the end of the day words mean nothing compared to actions

PurplePillDebate,removed,poor urban neighborhoods lol synonym for black neighborhood okay boo boo hamster it all out
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wonder if the reason girls seem to be approached by the kind of men who do violence in reaction to rejection is because the kind of guys who take it out on themselves when they get rejected dont approach very often and the guys who assign blame to neither party are extremely rare
PurplePillDebate,removed,pathetic
PurplePillDebate,removed,give me one example of when feminist have said that to men let me quote verbatim the challenge give me one example of when feminist have said that to men example was given response was ridicule

PurplePillDebate,removed,stop lolling unless your life is a joke
PurplePillDebate,removed,loneliness is brutal and if it persists it can lead to all sorts of mental issues and potentially suicide some people dont attract several dudes to fuck their asspussy at the same time and so it may be hard for you to realize that your inherent value will always assure human connection for you im not jealous but i wouldnt mind having a pussy for a change
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats unusual people want to reproduce with healthy mates to assure healthy offspring for every amputee that reproduces a mountain of others suffer alone their suicide rate is astronomical
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow you sure act like a bitch
PurplePillDebate,removed,ahh poor baby sorry to have to tell you this but you sprouting bullshit doesnt make you alpha it makes you stupid

PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont care about incels at all which is totally reasonable because you want chad to completely demolish your pussy while your husbandboyfriend is at work and the kids are sleeping this behavior of yours is totally normal actually but it would be nice if youd admit it
PurplePillDebate,removed,you like getting fucked violently
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dumb fucking bitch ive put in more effort than almost anyone i know ive been to the gym for more time than you will ever in your life you cant fathom that some people are irredeemably screwed by genetics so in order to preserve your weak understanding of reality you claim that im not putting in the effort
PurplePillDebate,removed,situational depression can be helped i understand that fair enough then legalize euthanasia for incels im dying soon anyways but most people wont get the assured and peaceful death that i will receive

PurplePillDebate,removed,it seems to me you are trying to justify your own slutiness as in trying to make yourself feel better if you bang many random dudes men will use you like a cumdumpster in this case that is the right thing to do people with no self respect dont deserve respect
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol i shit on your ad hominem i am not mad i myself tell sluts to fuck off because i wont touch them i have the power over them when you are not desperate for women and have the looks they want you and then you got the power to do anything you want save your suicide stats for someone who is actually capable of depression you chose the wrong guy
PurplePillDebate,removed,your man must be a faggot or a cuckbeta male he lacks dignity and self respect too poor guy as to you youre an object and i hope those men used you nicely hopefuly they used you as a human condom
PurplePillDebate,removed,she tries hard to make it look like sluts are on the higher ground but is obviously traumatized by her childhood most likely molested by her father funny thing is most women have pride and dignity she fucked guys and those guys used her up like an object and she is completely fine with that because in her retarded head she thinks she used them lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,we have no proof whether it really has and that goes for everybody on this sub until you selfdox so it is really pointless to talk about its an empty rhetorical move
PurplePillDebate,removed,id faster off you than myself stupid sluts dont know who theyre dealing with pathetic as fuck

PurplePillDebate,removed,how is he inferior he could most likely kill you with his bear hands in nature men are the predators and women like you are the prey you are delusional or something
PurplePillDebate,removed,all supposedlyempirical claims about the world are based on observation dingus you dont have any more access to the capitalt truth of the world than we do

PurplePillDebate,removed,of course women go through it as well its interesting to read about how the system was designed and for what purpose not everything is about you babe
PurplePillDebate,removed,it was inspired by male poor understandings and hatreds of women in various texts scriptures philosophies over centuries cant you recognize your own reflection sweetie can dish it but cant take it can you sensitive men
PurplePillDebate,removed,you perpetually oppressed victim oh gods free these poor poor men from womenz transfer them all to a different planet in a different galaxy out of sight out of mind let the men rape kill maim and oppress only one another amen
PurplePillDebate,removed,might hurt your brain eh
PurplePillDebate,removed,hold on a minute so let me get this straight you believe that it is toxic behavior for a living organism to do things in order to help it reproduce you do realise that every living organism on this planet lives its life with two main goals survival and reproduction you see this is the problem women have never had to fight for what they have they have always been given everything they were given their security they were given their rights they are given their assets which make them attractive in the sexual market they dont know what it is to fight for something and this has caused them to have such a skewed outlook of the world what women dont realise is no man wanted to like the beatles no man wanted to wear flowery shirts or have a manufactured and polished looked no man wants to talk about their emotions we dont want to bitch and moan and whine the way women do in order to get a man to do any of that you have to give him a reason and that reason is that it would increase his chances to reproduce imagine a world where every man is indifferent to having children and indifferent to having sex theyre just meh i dont really want kids or sex and you as a female want to have children well you would have to fight to convince a men to have children you would have to fight to make the man want to have sex with you what are you going to do well you are going to find out what men like and do it if they like women who cook and clean than you are going to cook and clean in order to make him want you if they want women who are fat than you are going to get fat in order to make him want you i know its hard for you to imagine a world where everything isnt handed to you on silver platter but do try it might help you learn how to be a logical human being
PurplePillDebate,removed,how can you insult something that doesnt exist
PurplePillDebate,removed,why would i be civil to the uncivil
PurplePillDebate,removed,so ban me no need to get into ego trips youre just a mod on an insignificant sub online aim higher in life
PurplePillDebate,removed,so may issues in your life must be hard

PurplePillDebate,removed,youre actually legitimately crazy
PurplePillDebate,removed,because it doesnt matter if muslims are innocent or not they ask need to be kicked out of the country
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao a true man does not care about what women think of him thanks for proving that there isnt a single real man in the whole of that autistic circlejerk that is the red pill p s my father is a feminist because he recognises that women in business can be great and raised me to be assertive never submissive
PurplePillDebate,removed,wasnt it red pill men who said they want a competitive world to feel like real men they have it already their only problem is that they are that worlds losers
PurplePillDebate,removed,the bible was written by a bunch of sluthate incels who wished to get welfare sex you suck at trolling
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think the mods have left town trolls like the one you replied to should have been banned by now
PurplePillDebate,removed,best response i hate how sexualised everythings become my nipples are not obscene or weird or trashy and more than my elbow or knee is youre fucking delusional
PurplePillDebate,removed,i grew up with the belief that conservatives were idiots that they all watched the local equivalent of fox news and were brainwashed cool me too european media has been largely against trump and this has reflected on how people see him if you think you have the moral ground like i thought when i was younger then it makes sense to dehumanize the opposition using shaming attacks and no arguments you say it bro
PurplePillDebate,removed,considering the existence of subs like rcreepypms and all the complaints about creepy guys dont you think its at least a little hypocritical when men are still societally expected to make the first move and initiate everything the thing is that when society expects men to first to make the first move they mean tall handsome muscular men the rest of the men are not supposed to approach women doesnt matter if the women are average or below average nonchads are expected to not even look at women
PurplePillDebate,removed,eat a dick this whole subreddit is based off mocking a whole group of people
PurplePillDebate,removed,shut up stop the incel crap safe the whining for tomorrow its trump time
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh yeah hun im sure you dont do you prove to beta bob you are not shallowlike the other girls by letting him cum over ur ass
PurplePillDebate,removed,i speak as an omega male you cant of course you can hit the gym you can dress well you can be interesting but youll never be anything more than an omega male you cant hide bad genes we were supposed to have died in childhood or taken ourselves out of the gene pool
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont worry there isnt much to be insulted
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre fucking retarded i mean for one women have a huge array of sex toys that gets them off better than actual sex by their own account women have easy access to an fucking sears catalogues worth of plastic dicks of all sizes shapes colors that vibrate bend do all sorts of shit a dick cant necessarily easily do plus they get to pick a good size rather than having to settle for whatever is attached to the guy they are seeing theyve got machines and all sorts of shit that makes sexbots seem stupid in terms of purely having orgasms women dont need men at all they can do it better themselves but the bigger issue is that like of sex is psychological theres a reason people say its exciting and fun and its not because its two people bumping against each other until a physical release has been met
PurplePillDebate,removed,for the first time ever i actually am optimistic about the white races chances of survival
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol the liberal tears are so delicious this is the best day ever
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you think sexism is funny now what about all those poor wymen
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is hard work pressing all these buttons on my keyboard
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are you trying to correct a hypothetical that didnt happen jesus christ youre annoying
PurplePillDebate,removed,the reason trump won is because people arent educated most americans dont even know who their local representatives are how on earth would they be able to distinguish the difference merely in experience when trump is whispering naughty things about immigrants in the ears of young white men so they can cum hard voting for trump was a crime of passion my friends are in danger my coworkers are in danger its very possible that i may literally have to consider never having sex again if abortion gets thrown away forget sex with men too because you idiots cant even sympathize with homosexuality because you hate gay people because you hate women because you hate minorites and you swear to god that you rapistsupporting rapists arent rapists oh but your presidential fucking candidate wants to grab people by the pussy cool bro give him the garage codes and the nuclear codes and he can shack up in my place
PurplePillDebate,removed,why dont you just marry your dad doesnt things in china work differently
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh man its gonna be hilarious when you get married and start cheating on your husband and future husbands because no man can compare to the uber alpha ideal youve built your father around lololol what a shitstorm just waiting to happen you are exactly what the red pillers warn men about and you dont even realize it lolol dude stay around we need more people like you here d
PurplePillDebate,removed,also feminist lefty chicks earn victim points by accusing white males of rape wheareas they are lowkey ostracized for going against the narrative when they accuse oppressed groups like refugees and muslims this means that accusations against refugees are more likely to be true and not motivated by libtard agenda
PurplePillDebate,removed,and yet im not worried when i walk past an upper class welldressed white man on the street at night funny huh
PurplePillDebate,removed,but you just mentioned super rich men who hire escorts if theyre rich enough they wouldnt be scared to pay alimony so why they dont simply divorce their wives because even rich men can be sent to the dumpster financially lol you are aware that money is not an endless resource a man can get fucked over completely by alimony look at brendon fraser or wtv is his name he was in the mummy george king of the jungle etc he was rich hes stuck paying alimony and is fucked up completley you havent seen her so you possibly cant say that i dont need to see her i can pick up the remote tune in to the ftv channel and see hundreds of year old models who are far more attractive than your aunt i know many older women who makes younger boys drool over them yes its called being a young man having a high sex drive and being able to fuck anything dont think that older women are hot just because a guy gets a boner ill fuck your mother if nothing better is around at the moment d
PurplePillDebate,removed,lookie here i can already guess a comment is yours just by seeing the same hateful dismissive tripe in its contents sad apathetic isolated little meaning in life not by choice sadness and apathy are normal reactions to the kind of situation incels find themselves in and isolation is a natural consequence of being single later into adult life feels a girlfriend will solve his problems no they dont but haters like you certainly like to claim that incels feel that way because it makes for such a deliciously convenient strawman doesnt it
PurplePillDebate,removed,remove the last paragraph that attacks other users in the thread and i will reapprove
PurplePillDebate,removed,i love my husband he is my rock my protector and provider i would never want lose him hes strong a lot of rp men are just not strong enough for marriage and have no confidence in themselves to maintain attraction and the moment he gets crippled and fired is when youll lose all respect for him and file for divorce awalt
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh so youre a cuck even worse d
PurplePillDebate,removed,just beeeeeeeeeeeeeeee yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,sorry not following
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is the type of shit that gets annoying i know youre a dude but you answer just like a chick you are basically telling him hes not genuine not real because he didnt have rock solid frameaccording to teh bubbly im all for people becoming happier bull shit this is a shitty answer hope this isnt what makes you happy rp is basically training wheels for a guy to be happy with himself so is therapy way to go on shitting on both
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre probably a repressed pedophile
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is no such thing no woman says oh im going to give this guy some lmr the woman either wants it or doesnt
PurplePillDebate,removed,planning a wedding with tons of family interference you not being man enough to step up for yourself and say no fuck you and your bullshit doesnt really help
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant say awalt just because youre bitter about the fact that you are low value and cant attract high quality women
PurplePillDebate,removed,she would rather have a man so wrapped up around her that he has no chance at all to leave she would rather a man who does absolutely everything for her and jumps every time she speaks just to please her of course we know this is only what women think they want once they get it they get bored they lose all respect for their so which means their attraction toward him is likewise gone which means they will be following their attraction out the door soon enough
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah go through the post history thats just a straight up troll im probably stupid for responding to bait like that but i couldnt pass up such an idiotic comment
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant answer but is pretty common across many cultures for both genders
PurplePillDebate,removed,okay so all men are pedophiles and want to rape babies many of them just dont because of the law amalt
PurplePillDebate,removed,pot meet kettle tho ive never been exposed to such a concentration of uptight and possessive women in my life as i have here on ppr control freaks the lot of them it seems
PurplePillDebate,removed,ah the old invalidate someones personal experiences ploy its not a ploy and the world is not all about you
PurplePillDebate,removed,the reality is that men are inferior as a whole its interesting that the inferior gender built literally everything that you enjoy how did women being such goddesses manage to relegate themselves to class citizens for of human existence why do criminals and rapists and sociopaths predominantly come from single mother households when raising children is literally the only thing you are good at
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not angry in the slightest i think its hilarious what is going to happen to europe thanks to their pathological need to embrace political correctness and feminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,but how many people die for their livestock lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,this isnt a real critique but some nonsense strawman argument that doesnt include any factual content i see no real to refute a non argument
PurplePillDebate,removed,how are you removing that yet not removing comments of the obvious troll hes replying to
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must be blind to how the world works do you really think that all guys who show their vulnerability are rejected by women if so you are completely out of touch with the rest of humankind
PurplePillDebate,removed,hmmm thinking about the tertiary educated feminists i know degree in mathsscience works in assessing groundwater dynamics nope not her degree in something stem idk what works alongside her siblings in a techheavy role in the family business which develops and maintains a range of tech products very specialised to a niche need nope not her degree in english lit with grad dip in education works in adult education at a college that specialises in adult reentry to education for folks who dropped out of education early mostly she works on making the languageartshumanities side of things accessible for smart people whose natural strengths are not in that area so if you dropped out of high school in to go work unqualified on computers and now you want to get back and get a degree so you look employable for higher level management she might be one of the ones supporting you in the changes you have to make idk do you count her science degree half a degree in medicine now works as a private investigator nope not her degree in drama and teaching currently works as a nanny to wealthy families where the mother works usually in fields like law her maybe idk though seems to me most of her money comes from the private spending power of the employed female population i mean sure it is outsourced shildcare as per the link but like who cares shes earning her money nursing i doubt that she counts as a useless unproductive major degree in psychology works for the public relations department of a multinational mining company theoretically she fulfills many of your criteria except shes not paid for by taxes half a degree in podiatry half a degree in stuff like history now works for the tax department auditing your lying cheating tax evading ass until it pays all that is due i spose she counts sort of maybe it isnt exactly a highly gendered field though plenty of guys working the same job httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubot
PurplePillDebate,removed,the op doesnt have a real clue of what the rp theory is about
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey dont try to confuse feminists with logic thats sexist
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes old ugly washed up and cucked up with a million bratty little african mutts
PurplePillDebate,removed,the silence on this one says it all i guess the lack of empathy for men as a rule never ceases to amaze me well its not like men in general are more empathetic i guess its just human to not be able to see the others feelings so easily but when you make a sidebyside comparison of a breach of trust where woman gets sexually assaulted and a man is raped of his freedom and resources and you still cant concede that they are similar then you are dense or disingenuous
PurplePillDebate,removed,how do you know have that it doesnt work long term are you a clairvoyent
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre feeding into your own points i dont agree with any of your facts as presented you state a lot of things as facts but theyre only facts to people who buy into your views im not one of them i dont believe men dont want to get married because they dont trust women not to leave or any of the rest of the so called facts you state its basically common knowledge so much so its in mainstream media points found this as the top link for why men dont want to get married i care about the future of the human race i have little national care in so much as i wouldnt blink if borders were dissolved and we became a planet of humans rather than one filled with hundreds of different splintered individual states that continue to bicker and waste time and resources that can be better spent on ensuring the survival of the species against all future threats we need to be pushing out into space no fighting over this one ball of dirt just waiting for the chance an asteroid is going to score a direct hit and remind us there is more to worry about than the trifles we have now i thought you werent for anarchy or do you think we could have a benevolent world dictator different cultures create different sets of personalities it makes the human race stronger to have different cultures because we have more diverse types of people war is part of our societal competition and countries with the best military also are the countries with the highest levels of cultural output education and technology research you can see this plainly look at the countries with the best military tech and then see how they do in culture education and research it was our military research that invented the internet for example what will going out into space accomplish more resources more people for what purpose my morality is based on what i think is the best based on my experiences its a mix of all manner of things i have seen and experienced over the years i look at every new point of view to see if it has anything useful to add i noticed two of the commandments impact adultery your point on that and your opinion on which are still relevant today thats just an aspect of what i consider when it comes to what i consider to be proper morals obviously i dont care much about the theistic elements but the rest is worth considering before you do something that other people dont is hardly my problem my pointing out two commandments are against adultery is how seriously it was taken compared to today where people dont care too much sounds like you have no morality you do what you feel is correct or good at the moment have you studied any morality much like kants objective nontheistic morality or utilitarianism that is common today
PurplePillDebate,removed,haha i like youre thinking
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is your confidence grounded in what are you good at work on yourself cultivate your confidence and charisma you give too many fucks about things you dont actually care about which is leading into anxiety increase your wit study stand up comedy and learn to reverse and amplify well its very useful even in professional settings
PurplePillDebate,removed,no wonder youre still so bp you dont see how women are solipsistic my so introduced me to the term years ago didnt expect it to be how all women see yet it sure is you ever win an argument with a woman and see that look of hatred in her eyes feel her coldness towards you never mind that what i said directly benefits her yet with men this doesnt happen almost ever ha ive had some men be truly delighted after they lost the argument because they learned something and saw something in a way they never had before never have i ended an argument with a man whether i won or lost and either of us project hatred or animosity
PurplePillDebate,removed,i blame the men who insist that enthusiastic consent is too confusing for them to avoid accidentally raping someone too scared to protest a sexual assault lol such a white knight
PurplePillDebate,removed,correct me if im wrong but youre a woman and im a man your experiences with women will differ from that of a mans as women behave quite differently towards other women than with men women dont want to be seen as slutty hoes so will act all virginal and pure around some people and totally naughty around others
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think getting involved in debates means someone is smarter sometimes its smarter not to get involved especially when its socially inappropriate or in instances where making your opinions known could hurt your prospects thats really not my point obviously there are good and bad times to debate debate is a place where logical reasoning skills are demonstrated and play off of each other to add to that men can bond really well over a good debate haha i find it quite intriguing how complex and technical and nuanced women will discuss beauty techniques but pretty much never will you find the same depth of interest in any serious subject see i feel like this statement reveals your bias why is beauty not a serious subject theres no such thing as shallow subjects and serious subjects only people with a shallow understanding of the subject beauty is an art a multibillion dollar industry a form of social signaling a passion and even a livelihood for lots of people and as you said yourself the discussions can get very in depth in terms of artistic principles technological improvements the business of beauty the chemistry and biology of skincare so what makes it any less serious than any other interest particularly creative interests it doesnt progress humanity it doesnt solve problems that matter problems that cause people hardship or pain or suboptimal living beauty helps women play pretend better thats primarily it if all cosmetics didnt exist tomorrow the world would be uglier but not really worse off of course there are shallow subjects talking about trivial immediate things like the weather is shallow talking about gossip is shallow theres literally no depth to shallow subjects no true discussion to be had just sharing feelings and opinions to be heard not discussed for some point for you to even have to ask facepalm and notice what you focused on is the part of the post talking about beauty you ignored the rest of the questionspresumably they didnt interest you much a trend women seem to do when talking to them in forums ignore lots of the post which for some reason men tend to do this less as a fashion history buff id love to be able to talk with my female friends about the historical cultural and economic events which shaped and are shaped by the beauty industry but none of them are into makeup go figure lol the irony of life what serious topics do you talk to your female friends about
PurplePillDebate,removed,more like i was raped by a woman who did the same thing i just described sir black knight so that justifies you attacking men and assume they do the same thing not only is that weak its not logical no idea what youre going on a out in your second paragraph
PurplePillDebate,removed,malignant narcissistic personality disorder pill but enough about youtell me what do you think about you
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol this nerdy runner is funny queer you need to relax alpha male and alpha female exist but the man will still lead the relationship he still will have power over the female simply because he is the stronger one that is how it works like uzes lightning you sound like a big fuck up of a man that or youre trolling
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are obviously a fucking cuck sent me slideshows of women holding men hahahah jesus fucking christ you obviously love to get fucked in your ass by a woman dont ya kid look i am foot and pretty cut i can kill any woman you know with bear hands you delusional twat
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah mate my bad its morning here and i did not even sleep yet besides english is my second language so i guess you can get fucked in your ass yes there are of women in the world exactly can kick my ass maybe even less basically pro fighters on highest level and ufc champions
PurplePillDebate,removed,but women can be rated and their attractivenesscan be assessed from pictures and mens cant now youre just making yourself look like a fool
PurplePillDebate,removed,again another fail dont tell me you wouldnt bang a girl in her car because of her voice and then never talk to her again because i wont believe you if there was two options both equally hot i would bang the one with the better voice
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think you missed the part where i said men
PurplePillDebate,removed,most antifeminist women are attention seeking snowflakes fify
PurplePillDebate,removed,look at the flair
PurplePillDebate,removed,it might be to some women but not many imo because that sort of image is more a gay male fantasy i dont know who posts that as a female fantasy but id assume they did it because muscles makes me wonder where they got it if not in just a google image search for muscled men id assume most sites with an image like that would be obviously gay male focused
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think you understand the criteria of scientific theories or what a theory is for that matter if youre trying to say empirical as opposed to theoretical it doesnt matter if its empirical and yes its empirical findings that were checked and only about of them yileded similar results its the subject of the field psychology cant be science in principle its just impossible to construct a theory that satisfies the criteria and empirical research without any theory behind it is not science please do you yourself a favor and read up on evolution of scientific theory from fact through experiments etc and the philosophy and methodology of science there are textbooks about it they will have both and youre making no sense right now and frankly its embarrassing
PurplePillDebate,removed,sigh are you alternatively gifted or something no im not speaking in those terms no no one says they are a monolithic groups people are just talking about majorities in such cases which in this case turns out to be wrong anyway or rather unstable the paragraph is just dumb and farfetched
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you believe young western women arewere attracted to bruce lee in the yes action stars had muscles they are designed to appeal to male hero worship not women bruce lee wasnt a heart throb
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am not attacking you i told you multiple times why your argument are wrong look up what scientific theory means then come back oh no i didnt make a claim the default state is nothing is a science until proven otherwise or should i also prove you that photography is not a science or culinary i dont even need to refer to that one study if you dont care about the truth and dont want to find yourself and still dont want to believe me then its up to you to stay ignorant i am not doing your hw for you again you are perfectly capable of googling it yourself and i even told you what to google moreover in such debate its assumed you already know it without me even bringing it up otherwise why would you even open your mouth to say its a science if you didnt do any research to see if its reproducible etc and if you did then why would you ask me to provide a source the point is that even without that research its obvious that psychology is not a science because it doesnt meet other criteria as well once again read about things i mentioned theories must meet the criteria that i listed multiple times go ahead and try to show how psychology is for example falsifiable its just not and no this debate can hardly be civil because its annoying im not here to debate these things it feels like talking to a fifthgrader or something about the complex numbers you cant explain and prove that negative numbers can square roots to a person like that he needs to read some more first so he can reach the level of who hes talking to do that and then we can have civil debate maybe but probably not because you would know the stuff already but mostly because its irrelevant to the op its about sex and relationship not about someone assuming she knows it all because of the degree even though no reading on the subject was done sorry there can absolutely be no civil debate with how you carry yourself here all those downvotes
PurplePillDebate,removed,trololol
PurplePillDebate,removed,i believe the reason why you see lots of welladjusted males is that the emasculation epidemic you hear about in the manosphere is overblown waaaay out of proportion
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not rp but i can answer this question the men that women are attracted to have figured this stuff out on their own men who are having trouble with women whether red pill purple pill or blue pill have not figured this out and yes there are tons of men who havent figured this out you women dont find them attractive so they are basically invisible to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i would shoot her
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol i would leave a guy who had strippers at his bachelor party and i think its reasonable if he did the same if i had a stripper
PurplePillDebate,removed,it sounds to me like you are describing comfort not attraction its not lack of comfort that is killing passion its too much comfort and not enough dread what you should do as a woman is be more submissive and probably not ever get into another ltr since you sound like a serial cheater just get ready to die old with some cats what guys should do is always keep their options open and when you start shit testing them for your next branch swing throw some serious active dread up to reignite your vaginal juices and prepare himself to trade you in for a newer younger model the absolute last thing any guy should do is to try to up up his comfortintimacy with you at this point unless he wants you to cheat so he has a ready excuse to go get that hot new young thing hes been eyeing also this is why no guy should ever listen to any woman for any of this kind of advice the solipsism in your post is off the charts
PurplePillDebate,removed,fukk off
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why its good for rp to convince men to avoid marriage where were they when i needed them swear it happened so fast one minute i was getting blowjobs massages cooked meals and minimal bs the next minute shes got a ring on her finger and apparently some bug crawled up her ass demanding criticizing and bitching and her legs are like a steel trap marriage is hell thinking of enlisting just to get away from her maybe enjoy some hookers overseas
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean it probably sucks having to bang girls that are now instead of id cry and be melodramatic too if that was the worst problem in my life yeah first world problems
PurplePillDebate,removed,most of them are shitscared theyre missing out on something they decide to throw the baby out with the bathwater but in the back of their minds they know its fear of commitment of being hurt of losing someone driving their outright refusal to open up to anyone i feel bad for anyone like that of course you have to go through a lot of bullshit and pain to get to that one person you can share a life with build something with and grow old with but sheltering yourself by deadening your emotions so that meaningless sex and shallow fun is as much a connection as you can find with another personi myself cant see that as sustainable satisfaction and fulfillment for the long haul female solipsism right here
PurplePillDebate,removed,jesus christ im beginning to think the difference between bp and rp is that bpers are autistic that statement was never made to be taken literally it is a generalization that is true in the vast majority of couples jesus
PurplePillDebate,removed,men are supposed to be have both alpha and beta traits they are supposed to beta enough to not be assholes and alpha enough to not be pushovers its about balance the same can be said about women gentle enough to not be bitches and courageous enough to not let others take advantage of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,this exchange has gotten too autistic for me to continue what exactly do you have trouble understanding
PurplePillDebate,removed,not in all situations but i do believe more often than not women want to be lead by a strong capable man who they trust its a human thing not a women thing people inherently gravitate towards security as a man its a good lifestyle to adopt
PurplePillDebate,removed,slow clap
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is a mixed bag and submissive can run the gamut however i have been around the block a few times and what i would consider the perfect girl would leave you blue pill fuckers completely aghast
PurplePillDebate,removed,baahahaha the femist marsupial is really getting owned in this thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,if by misanthropic you mean hostile towards unworthy life forms sure i cant be held responsible if others dont share my characteristics however their inferior dnaupbringing is to blame for that hatred is warranted when someones existence is inconvenient and occasionally a threat incels are potential eliot rogers no one at ppd ever empathizes with them and i simply carry that logic forward to its natural conclusion some people simply deserve death bp posters may be too polite to say it but they are thinking it
PurplePillDebate,removed,absolutely nothing year olds are much more vulnerable and malleable you can practically enslave one if your pushpullgaslight game is on point they are younger tighter more submissive just better in every respect if shes shes post wall i met my wife when she was an year old virgin and i could give a fuck less about the cradle robber jokes and disdain of certain envious late singleton cunts in my friend circle worth it
PurplePillDebate,removed,subsaharan africa needs to be put under control also the hispanic population in united states european birth rates need to be risen if western civilization is to continue its not going to survive without its founding genetic group
PurplePillDebate,removed,generations refers to the fact that different age groups were included in the study young and old men not the longitudinal nature of the study
PurplePillDebate,removed,the researchers concluded that the decline in testosterone does not appear to be attributable to observed changes in explanatory factors including health and lifestyle changes such as smoking and obesity you might suspect fraud or dubious research practices but they intended from the outset to control for obesity among many other things yes i admit it could be a flawed study but do you have any evidence to back up that assertion
PurplePillDebate,removed,i get the feeling hes just some creepy neckbeard especially from his thread history lets face it giving women the right to vote was a dumb idea and itd our fault as a result women have completely destroyed the nuclear family women if its you body your rights then why do you hold the government or men responsible for your decisions whats wrong with fat shaming especially fat shaming women members of ask women why do you guys put down thin slim and toned women why do women expect to be respected as much as a man when women are held at a lower standard in western society i hope i never run into a guy like this
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes many of my gorgeous musician friends at uni paired up with women who were essentially sugar mommas its a thing that happens i think a more common version of afbb for men is thatokay this sounds really weird but ive heard from more than one man that there are certain women that they think are too hot to date that you want to go for a good girl and gorgeous women are never good so they fuck around with the gorgeous women in their and then wife up a or because they think shes more stable afbb
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol lrn reed youre a girl who has no real idea what male sexuality is like because whatever she suspects of being true she hates and so vehemently denies teens mostly do look like sexually mature women and often look best at that age and like i said lrn rd plz if you have an issue with that then you have an issue with male sexuality as a whole
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes a loser i dont even want to imagine what kinda man is okay with marrying a hooker congrats though

PurplePillDebate,removed,saving the best is an infantile theory for low quality men to justify their own undesirability essentially its pushing the responsibility onto the womans lap and gives terp and merp low betas more ammo to fire at women while in essence its their own fault for ending up in that situation shes isnt saving anything she doesnt have the desire to please you in any filthy manner that your degenerate brain comes up with

PurplePillDebate,removed,i have no reason not to believe them and neither do you fuck you
PurplePillDebate,removed,careful bloop your hatred is showing
PurplePillDebate,removed,poor younot like you couldnt just leave if you were being abused
PurplePillDebate,removed,your claim that you know plenty of women who claim they have been raped before not even including how you would even know if it were true or false sounds like the exaggeration your entire post is aloof and vile and a perfect example why women need protections at best youre just a sexist imbecile but let some guy read your words and think there is any validity and sicc em to the world i bet every time there is a case with irrefutable proof you dismiss it as an exception and as a reason for women to calm down and not thing about the odds bet you wouldnt take those kind of chances if it were your personal safety on the line
PurplePillDebate,removed,im simply pointing out the similarities between her mode of operation and a teenagers given the topic being discussed it seemed like a cogent point
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol we would never hang out and here is why you sit on the internet and contribute to the hardships of real people by perpetuating your armchair theory bullshit that is only spouted from the mouth of someone who knows nothing of struggle how at this point of our society are we having anyone act as if sexual abuse rape exploitation are all figments of the imagination because in his tiny world of party girls someone seemed like they might be lying that you think it is more likely that these atrocities arent happening because your exposure to women is in college and at the club reinforces the support from anyone in the middle of the road on this topic it tells anyone who might be classified as an adult all they need to know you dont speak with reason you reek of undeserved entitlement and so no i dont need to know you you cant possibly be a person of value as you grow dank in that fucking bubble you spout your bullshit out of men like you are exactly why there needs to be a vicious element in pursuing safety for woman no matter how exhausting the rest of us find it men like you marginalize other men who really arent predators or dangerous they get lumped in with you and your lazy commentary would be awesome if you life does not exist outside of my head types just all went the fuck away
PurplePillDebate,removed,nothing to do with that set aside your bitterness and be logical
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop trying to change the subject you hypocrite i was talking specifically about situations where a terper is treating his girlfriend like a child from the get go i posit that such relationships are not abusive you apparently cannot argue the opposite without trying to subtly change the whole premise typical tbp hypocrisy
PurplePillDebate,removed,tldr the leftists are scared that people of other its all thought are allowed to exist therefore suckerpunching men in the street and surrounding and attacking a lone woman is all understandable behaviour no the left has shown that its a violent cesspit of intolerance to political diversity
PurplePillDebate,removed,you say in reply facepalm
PurplePillDebate,removed,racist pig
PurplePillDebate,removed,its possible hes a feminist and realizes any contact without clearly stated affirmative consent in advance is literal rape
PurplePillDebate,removed,so its ok for men to engage in sexual contact with women without her consent this is rape culture
PurplePillDebate,removed,apparently many antifeminists are feminists
PurplePillDebate,removed,one would hope she has sense and instead of making shit up in her head just figures that he wants to get to know the girl more first if you want me to escalate you on the first date im gonna end up making you do some nasty shit to get my rocks off
PurplePillDebate,removed,sweet trper tears
PurplePillDebate,removed,if a guy is really muscular he probably spends hours every day at the gym certain women are into that but if they are looking for a good conversation after sex thats probably not the trait they are looking for this is a perfect example of how people tear each other down to make themselves feel better and its absolutely disgusting you should be ashamed of yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,which is why the racist liberals love abortion so much
PurplePillDebate,removed,ime youre right sluts dont typically go out to the clubs or frat parties just prowling for chad cock some probably do but i think most are more organic sluts like me who just end up sleeping with friends coworkers and other trusted acquaintances that are generally in their league lookswise

PurplePillDebate,removed,this is exactly the reason even outside of trp contexts you cannot even state truisms such as women like money without getting lambasted and tons of im not like comments women hate having their preferences sexuality etc laid out in front of them by anyone else but themselves they cling on to the belief theyre more individual and morally sound when it comes to sexuality than men

PurplePillDebate,removed,with holding social privileges because we have biological one is the most ridiculous thing i can think of its like saying alimony laws are fair to men often they arent because men have greater upper body strength genetically they do apples and oranges men cant help being born bigger and stronger any more than women can help giving birth thats why its apples and oranges name a legalsocioeconomic privilege and we can start having a rational discussion otherwise youre just an idiot with a bad analogy and no point

PurplePillDebate,removed,youre removing it from its proper context stop arguing like a bitch in the context of trying to understand a womans fantasies yes you listen to her words and then decipher what she actually wants and why reading their fiction is also distinctly different than listening to them its literally what women pay money to experience and tells you a lot indirectly about their mind and desires
PurplePillDebate,removed,she claims that her crimes were the result of growing up poor and being abused as a child all sins forgiven
PurplePillDebate,removed,focusing on a healthy eating routine to pare down those pounds would serve her much better
PurplePillDebate,removed,this doesnt follow they let down their guard around him but that doesnt mean that they consented to getting hypnotized hmm hmm ok let me guess how that misunderstanding happened what you read so if the hypnosis claims are true they consented to the hypnosis molestation what every normal person reads so if the hypnosis claims are true they consented to the hypnosis

PurplePillDebate,removed,now in the age of sexual liberation and with no significant consequences for casual sex or any kind of sex this just fucking sucks doesnt it women being able to have casual sex now when the top men hookup with women in lower tiers these women now have a validation they can get these types of men for hooking up and casual sex ooh shit yeah i forgot women only have sex for validation they dont have clitorises or anything and cant feel pressure those evil harpies gentrification is the scenario where more wealthy people have particular real estate or commercial interest in an area and that area initially has poor living qualities or subpar establishments sex is not currency well maybe it is to the weirdo terps and manosphere incels cmv go into the real world and look at people
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you here to circle jerk or have a discussion i came here to circlejerk and have a discussion and im all out of discussion your post basically sounds like some rincels level whining about feminism chads and how regular cant get laid because of hyperorigami what is there to even discuss
PurplePillDebate,removed,i could copypaste what you wrote make it into a rthebluepill thread and it would get upvoted because its that crazy
PurplePillDebate,removed,how many tvs in your house do you actually need even one certainly you dont need a tv to keep your job purely for entertainment but theyre not exactly ethically produced either as i told you already all youre doing is hamstering the main thing that gets me here is that some people clearly dont actually care about this moral shit but they feel the need to act like they do at least i am honest i dont give a flying fuck if my technology is made by dirt poor year olds i have a side business selling phones i buy for only £ they may very well be produced by literal slaves for all i know the point is im honest i dont pretend i care more than i do you claim to care so much yet you drop you precious morals because you want an expensive selfie machine its amusing
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a woman sex and relationships with chads are handed to you on a silver platter you have no idea what its like to be a male nonchad

PurplePillDebate,removed,do lines of blow with a bartender doesnt make you a nasty perverted bad boy lolol because it can cause a man to want to commit suicide after realizing how catty and shallow everyone is did some mean girl hurt your feelings ive read this a couple times and the only thing i come away with is that you may have a crush on either ian or matt or both
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes divorces are hard and you have to split your assets but but then she gets of my paycheck as alimony and shell spend the money on baseball caps to buy chad
PurplePillDebate,removed,bernie sanders isnt radical you dumb fuck hes a centrist
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not just about saying something its how you treat them its how you isolate them how you get in their head are you seriously so dense that you cant comprehend that people have the ability to psychologically mess with someone jesus
PurplePillDebate,removed,jesus christ youre stupid read up on it if youre so incapable of understanding it youre stuck in this they say mean things mindset like thats all they do there is much more to it theres threats isolation controlling possessiveness but yeah its just someone calling you a bitch and you not walking away from it frankly its disgusting how ignorant you are to it
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant expect the wee little princess to fix anything can you the day that buying an expensive purse fixes relationships ill give her a call
PurplePillDebate,removed,sluts are scumworthless beingsthe scourge of the earth you can find variations of this sentiment throughout the manosphere if youre denying this thats pretty disingenuous and clearly there wont be any further need to engage with you so any kind of broad brush smear of their character based on their sexual activities is shaming is that right
PurplePillDebate,removed,get the fuck outta here they dont understand how sexual attraction worksthen maybe single mothers dont understand how relationships work
PurplePillDebate,removed,whats with you you cant take being completely wrong huh
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh please i was being as tame as possible its not like i said you are wrong because you are stupid shes a big girl bigger than you i suspect and if she has an issue with the dialogue then she can tell me and i wil respond accordingly
PurplePillDebate,removed,cmv a competent adult has an obligation to unambiguously communicate any withdrawal or lack of consent during a sexual encounter sure she doesnt need to communicate that because i wont be taking it into account either way you arent entitled to just blueball me in the middle of the act sry if a woman gets frisky with me shed best be prepared for the consequences if she isnt then thats on her and i could give a shit less besides her nos will turn to yeses soon enough once i get up in that
PurplePillDebate,removed,so essentially you have no idea how freeze response works and you assume a look of get me the fuck out of here is standard with your dates youre not a competent adult i mean that in a very literal sense youre a danger to yourself and others and your argument wont make any difference in court except to make the jury hate you
PurplePillDebate,removed,who isnt a sperg youre all spergs
PurplePillDebate,removed,op is clearly stating their lack of actual sexual encounter experience if this is supposed reality
PurplePillDebate,removed,well make it more easier to support a family while going to school or work offer universal daycare this alone would create so many job opportunities and would probably help out a lot of struggling families

PurplePillDebate,removed,or maybe you are mad that i am right so you switch goalposts like any low iq moron you would never approach these men and thus they are not attractive to you sorry but you do not get to redefine what attractive means your ad hominem attacks means nothingjust like your self proclaimed lust for skinny twigs
PurplePillDebate,removed,and yet that has nothing to do with stem well done hoggy you missed the point entirely and just kept on driving
PurplePillDebate,removed,and despite my dick being slightly bigger than inches lol inches is not a big dick that is average guys who enjoy bjs are almost always guys who have small or average sized dicks for guys who have dicks that are inches and longer it is nearly impossible for women to do a bj for longer than minutes also regarding your flair in which you identify yourself as a former alpha i browsed your post history and found a few gems in which you admit to having a dead bedroom in which you ask if lifting is important to smv lol based on your post history you arent alpha youre in your and youre fat no one cares if you were alpha years ago when you were in high school
PurplePillDebate,removed,ahahah omg dude are you going through my history and downvoting all my comments thats fucking sad umm thats a weird conclusion to come to i dont downvote anything on any sub so you can take your bullshit assumptions elsewhere you arent really worth the time it would take to even bother doing that
PurplePillDebate,removed,other than pedophiles jesus you are pathetic just because hot alpha men like me find older women repulsive you want to shame me it will not work hahaha soon you will have a man like me for president try and shame donald about his preferences for young beautiful women my preferences are natural only weak beta men play to the argumeny that you should date women close to your age why why should i to please their disgusting botix laden flabby baggage ridden post wall cat lady hearts no i will not fuck you and no powerful man ever will again get used to it and follow the blue pill road to locking down a beta he can tell you what a powerful independant woman you are while he shampoos the carpet

PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes but i absolutely guarantee that amongst your youg female or college student friends that many of them have slept with older men i have various online profiles when i started dating after my dicorce the market was all new to me i knew nothing then i started getting messages from university students and models in their this surprised me so i started dating them theybwould say things like i am just so tired of guys my age they are so immature i like more experienced men they actually care if i have a good time in bed this was an eye opener to me in fact a significant percentage of younger women deliberately target older men so i am not that crrepy old uncle annoying girls at the university bar i am the gentleman they meet online who gives them tingles i am the guy they brag about i am the guy they always call whem they ate sad or horny or need advice they treat me very well and i treat them very well
PurplePillDebate,removed,that is his expe what on earth would make you think i feel that way i have read your comments tou talked about feeling all spiritual when your wife blows you take that pussy iff the pedestal jesus your brain is completely feminised i pity you you should give some serious thought to banging that single mum you are fantasising about
PurplePillDebate,removed,either that or youre paying her in money or drugs or rent or tuition or whatever it is you live in a small scary little world in your world any younger woman who dates an older guy is a victim a fool or a whore you deny them agency are you saying the any woman who dayes dicaprio clooney depp woods is a loser or a vicrim are you male if so go and hand in your penis and badge youre fired
PurplePillDebate,removed,the problem is that they dont understand why she would want you you are a hate filled and pathetic worm if many girls in their mid hardly children or immature want to sleep with me or other attractive powerful older me then who are you to judge them who are you to be the morality police you make me sick you are utterly repulsive
PurplePillDebate,removed,but it is perfectly ok for people to line up and call me a liar and compare me to a paedophile
PurplePillDebate,removed,cmv lol you spelled rage bait wrong i wont cmv because this is little more than a childish attempt to put down trp and people that follow it and shame itthem for being a fairly honest straight forward sub but then what else can one expect from tbp which is really a hate sub masquerading as satire
PurplePillDebate,removed,cmv most cmvs posted by bloopers are ignorant but arguable on the face of their title but then provide an op that amounts to little more than a snivelling rant dripping with smugness and an air of superiority brought about by reaction formation in most cases have nothing to fucking do with the title but seriously what view am i supposed to challenge here the title on its face or your musings on how most men think or what they know about women
PurplePillDebate,removed,how dare they hate the haters assholes need to check their privilege
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you never went through an anger stage and actually improved yourself via your time at trp then kudos to you different people get to self improvement via different motivations
PurplePillDebate,removed,hi op could you make the content of your post a little less personalized i think this is a great cmv but right now its pretty much limited to your own growth in response to rp

PurplePillDebate,removed,i heard he loses at super smash brothers to his grandkids all the time
PurplePillDebate,removed,luckily no one cares what some withered old randroid thinks
PurplePillDebate,removed,you know that things dont become true just because you say them
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh why wont someone force men to give women even more free stuff they are sooo oppressed
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a giant loser parade they should come together more so everyone can see who they really are
PurplePillDebate,removed,how do you debate people whose entire belief system is just a bunch of bullshit they make up on the fly

PurplePillDebate,removed,erryou ought to read her posts over the past year or so she isnt in a fit state of mind nothing to do with reclaiming a word like that she just needs a good pounding some friends some positive relief in her life
PurplePillDebate,removed,bounce nerd
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think if you interpret her posts in that manner youre delusional the posts she has written unveil paranoia fear and anxiety its not something to be applauded she takes every little thing which challenges her narrative whether it be pro or anti feminist to be a personal slight if you think like that youll always be unhappy
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have no idea why women think im a creep red pill guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,redschool is dum
PurplePillDebate,removed,agreed
PurplePillDebate,removed,i remember darlock lol what a pile of shit hope he gets falsely accused of rape
PurplePillDebate,removed,think you want to reword that reworded its fairly obvious isnt it not it isnt are we seriously going to do everything is because im afraid of men being serial killers route the one as many holes in it as a swiss cheese sorry but its been debunked enough were just gonna lay it out flat the reason thousands of men have empty threads isnt because every single woman in reddit is afraid of them in fact actual scary rapists and serial killers like ted bundy or breivik get quite a lot of love letters without even having to ask by the way even the threads in which men ask for an online chattingonline flirting partner still get no replies while female requests for online partners do so that argument has no merit
PurplePillDebate,removed,well your agenda is pretty obvious too every man is a potential rapist and women are soo afraid they almost have ptsd when they see a man write triggering already by any chance
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not an accusation its fact when it comes to online chattingflirting remotely ltr women still get the same amount and men still get none this refutes your claim meanwhile you have absolutely no proof that women wont reply to guys on because they are all afraid those guys are rapists and serial killers a completely outlandish and baseless idea and women can meet strangers just fine when it suits them i accuse you of lying because your claim makes no sense it is a pure deflection one which is often resorted to
PurplePillDebate,removed,only because of the gender ratio
PurplePillDebate,removed,wtf is this shit get out of your head
PurplePillDebate,removed,it has nothing to do with ratios its hypergamy natural female instinct
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you dont overthink things your husband will leave you for an year old attending an ivy league university
PurplePillDebate,removed,im a woman my life is so hard pay attention to me i dont think its healthy to keep giving you attention you should maybe get therepy
PurplePillDebate,removed,isnt rpw all about surrendering even to the point of not correcting the mans driving when hes about to take a minute detour many of us like to read for general guidance regarding how not to be a cunt or you could just grow up that works too
PurplePillDebate,removed,girls get confused and coerced all the time because theyre too stup i mean too afraid of big strong men to say no i mean why even bother saying no theres like a percent chance the guy is just going to beat you up and rape you anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes it is known that there is very little on offer for women who did marry betas but are honoring their vows and striving to build a real marriage something very close to that idiotic sentence from upembayliss was an early part of the turnaround in my own marriage
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you dont have anything of substance to say its okay to say nothing you should take your own advice cause you just basically posted muuuuuum im telling
PurplePillDebate,removed,women are funny creatures in todays sexpositive culture sex is pretty trivial its just something people do recreationally and barely means a thing but social awkwardness thats really uncomfortable for most women youd be surprised how many women will fuck a guy they dont want to fuck just to get it over with and avoid any possibility of a scene or awkward social encounter
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you illiterate
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre either trolling or dumb
PurplePillDebate,removed,it has to do with the comment you just posted to me that is the thread we are commenting in right now in direct responses to each other dae logic
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive heard with a stack and you can burn at both ends for a while anyways though pretty sure they were talking dbol which i wouldnt go near
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know women have a hard time getting a defecit without just not eating they need it to create a defecit the average woman who aparently weighs as much as men did in the isnt that outlier case hitting the weights laying off the cookies fraps and booze is of the battle luckily chicks dont have the t levels to bulk up and just break down and repair muscles to similar sizes dont worry about it cupcake no one is staring at you grunt on the squat rack you wont accidentally get swole and hard work is hard that mental fortitude makes it worth it
PurplePillDebate,removed,adults are more likely to mix a conflictharmony intention with a status intention so you get the following four basic types of attitude informing an interaction condescension i am better than you and for you contempt i am better than you and against you supplication i am worse than you and for you insolence i am worse than you and against you vintatesh rao sincerely sweetcheecks
PurplePillDebate,removed,read the responses on the thread i had a ton of good conversations that went in several directions your response is the outlier again if youd like to quote where i claimed that anal rape is equivalent to lying about your profession be my guest otherwise stfu
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah i dont even lift sue me
PurplePillDebate,removed,implying that the equivalent of the real deceptiontm as experienced by the woman the one a guy lied to about his income no shithead this is what i was talking about in the other thread all fucking day yesterday legislators cited a case in western massachusetts in which a woman consented to intercourse with her boyfriends brother because he claimed to be the womans boyfriend i quoted this at least half a dozen times in the original thread which is why i began a new thread getting fucked by someone you believed was someone else was the point of my thought experiment and was the point of the original article linked to in the original thread read before you speak youll look a lot less stupid i never one time said anyone should be accused of anything besides lying for lying about their income
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really dont know shit from clay do you mate
PurplePillDebate,removed,rollo
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is some grade a retard logic right there
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you keep mention of your std issues off this board
PurplePillDebate,removed,that is too much autism for me to read stop trying to understand females it is the first stop to becoming incel
PurplePillDebate,removed,exactly im sue melvanka covers her eyes with a hundred dollar bill while donald is hammering away on top of her then after he finishes she wipes herself down with a pile of hundreds how else could she tolerate him
PurplePillDebate,removed,yah but hes famous and i am a short asian
PurplePillDebate,removed,that sounds immature not masculine not like youd know how masculine sounds like
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree all sex is rape all women are forced into relationships by patriarchy all women are naturally lesbian otherwise women are perfectly capable of running their own civilizations and can do anything men can do women are smarter than men the only reason most scientists were men is the oppression women need men like a fish needs a bicycle
PurplePillDebate,removed,im saying that not everyone is as insecure as you and plenty of couples like to spice up sex with imagination not all of them are physically attracted to each others bodies but they can still be physically attracted to each other
PurplePillDebate,removed,no youre just excluding everyone different from you because you cant handle complexity its tedious but go for the victim politics like a good altright sjw thatll help me ignore all the projecting
PurplePillDebate,removed,boyfriend half the number you suck
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats not a freaking short leash i communicate like this with my parents and i am a grown adult i say i will be late coming home today or i am going to the store right now or i am going for a walk thats not a short leash you moron its letting your partner know where you are and what you are up to
PurplePillDebate,removed,i made no claims about specific people of course not your comment would be moderated so you call them liars in the abstract most trp concepts are borrowed the rest are way too often wrong more projection youre the one who refuses to deal with people fantasizing during sex like an adult
PurplePillDebate,removed,definitely i am average by looks want to back this up with some proof
PurplePillDebate,removed,and yet i am nothing special lookswise at all mate trust me on this i wish i could just post a photo without being instadoxxed honestly you can blur your nose mouth and eyes you can tell pretty well how attractive a guy is from the shape of his face complexion hairline and hair color
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure i tell my gf when im leaving it would be rude not to i dont tell her when im coming home when i go out with my friends because im not a child who needs to check in with his mommy my gf doesnt really leave the home except with me cause her place is inside the house she quit her job recently because i explained to her that if she cant shut down guys from hitting on her that our relationship would not be one where she gets my commitment she decided that the only way she could get that to happen was to quit and only work somewhere with attractive guys around cunt tried to break my frame over it though blaming me several times to which i replied that wasnt going to work then she started crying lol and picked up her purse to run off so i ignored her and her crocodile tears stopped immediately she tried that dumb crying bullshit one more time but it stopped within seconds when i ignored her anyway she no longer has a job except to cook clean look pretty and be available for sex though depending on how i feel i may make her get a job after christmas i just got to figure one out where i can drop in on her and she wont be customer facing a lot of guys hell sometimes i think it would be better to just ltr up an uggo and cheat on the side
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive found lots of strangers sexy in my time but never fucked or wanted to fuck a single one i agree with this when i was not in a relationship which was probably out of my life if im in lust at first sight im not going out of my way to talk to them unless i know of something connecting us a common friend interest etc
PurplePillDebate,removed,on to rmngtow and ralwayswhining i do i noice
PurplePillDebate,removed,im actually perma banned on the incel sub because i took my time to tell them how they could get women by improving themselves and letting go of the bitterness i was just viciously attacked by the sub members and banned they dont want to change they just want to complain and act like attention hoes by saying they are going to kill themselves
PurplePillDebate,removed,sjws love picking easy targets weak defeated men that frequent rfa fit that mold perfectly
PurplePillDebate,removed,leftists masculinity fitted with che not that i mind per se i would like nothing more than for leftism to be relegated to the proverbial dustbin of history where it belongs right alongside other failed murderous antihuman ideologies
PurplePillDebate,removed,he lefts throw money at problem isnt is that why the red states receive more federal spending you realize that giving money to the poor leads to them spending that money and stimulating the local economy choke back your outrage and actually think meanwhile theres supply side spending which may lead to the money being carefully invested in tax havens or sent overseas or turned into short term gains at the cost of long term health through playing the stock market or result in a massive price increase if the government is paying directly like for tuition health care and the military how naive are you though the cultural marxists are hard at work shaming mathematics into being less white male and patriarchal yeah thats pretty naive politicians from both parties overspend theyre almost certainly going to do something more useful with it than the millions of poor people would but no im not in favor of giving them free money and no amount of reasoning or logic will rescue you from that fate takes one to know one i really doubt youll reach that level of selfawareness
PurplePillDebate,removed,dude you post on rconspiracy your mind is too open
PurplePillDebate,removed,run along princess coward pussy conspiracy is the original redpill
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah just like jon stewart wasnt spinfed news huh leftists disingenuous as fuck its not a joke they despise redpill and would help us all recover they are a feeder for rexredpill serious enough they are sjws and they are fine with the gynocentric stat quo unless its not gynocentric enough so fuck you and your vapid snark at least i substantiate my ridicule you disingenuous poseur
PurplePillDebate,removed,i already acknowledged that this is the designated debate sub you dont really have to be here i am apparently beneath you and i have no interest in your contribution youre being nonsensible again you can see yourself out in short order honestly
PurplePillDebate,removed,the sad thing is you probably believe your own spurious drivel
PurplePillDebate,removed,replace the word woman with person who isnt the breadwinner sorry dude i hate to break your misogynisic terp fantasy but you arent getting an advantage in court because you have a pussyif that were true all the beautiful terps would but for being the one at home raising the kids
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you insulted the head of a sub and then got muted shocking go clutch your pearls elsewhere bitch this is the exact response i was mad about who are you responding to nonsense for you didnt hire anyone to type and it isnt helping me just more leftist condescension thats new edgy even bitches ate that twisted shades shit up yall can wear your big girl panties now the whole point of trp is that there are different rules for succesful trumpite alphas women put up with that shit culture is decadent bitches are sheisty you are a cuck and none of those is trumps fault
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think the point about friends and social circle is often overlooked guys tend to lose the vast majority of their friends in a divorce most probably havent had single male friends in years and even the married friends they had often bail on them because his soontobeex is friends with their wives and when those wives side with the stbex guess what the men married to them do bail pussy speaks louder than friendship for manymost ive seen it joked about that friends are also divided in a divorce but like most things the division is rarely equal
PurplePillDebate,removed,awww indeed you are a victim of the patriarchy everytime a man disagrees with you and doesnt drop whatever hes doing to support you hes taking away your rights utterly unimpressed friend you seem to be pissed off about us seeing right through female behavior to get male attention and free stuff etc and you are mad u mad bro ubutthurt bro
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok i guess if you want to believe that thats your right trp confirmed you dont like it because hes talking about his real emotions
PurplePillDebate,removed,she doesnt feel entitled to his money once they divorce she is entitled to his money after a divorce gold digger detected
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah its really a fucked up joke being played on people i cant think of any other reason its gotten so stupid over time im just so glad im not that anymore also one thing ive noticed is that in those times of so much self rejection i was much more of a consumerist and a stoner gamer
PurplePillDebate,removed,rreeeeeeeeee
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think what op is getting at is more and more women are bitching about being approached in places they dont want to be approached they seem to basically demand to only be approached when they want where they want and by who they want and these demands tend to put more men into a disadvantage or in massive competition reread what you just wrote are you fucking insane do you actually believe that women owe it to men to put out when and where men want them to that they should drop whatever they are doing to deal with your lame pick up lines because it is convenient for you and makes you happy dude fuck all that shit reading through your response i am quite confident that you will go through your entire life and never bring another human being to orgasm
PurplePillDebate,removed,why did you link an article that completely contradicts your op i dont think you even read it before linking it i think you just saw the title and went aha and put it in your comment i did read it i just know how to separate bullshit from data actually the article you linked does say why you just dont seem to like to answer dude you did not read my comment at all it is bad to answer the question why without proving it with an experiment because answer to why is a hypothesis and those first have to be proven take newtons laws data apples fall from trees feminist why because trees are oppressive and apples cant even newtons why because fma
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is factually supported that most divorces leave the men feeling bitter and sad men after divorce have the highest risk of suicide reasons for those feelings may be factual or not they exist and should not be ignored
PurplePillDebate,removed,when i get these kind of responses i always wonder if feminist supporters are really that dense or just pretend to be
PurplePillDebate,removed,a substantial part of the problem is race x sex not just sex id support research researchbased interventions accordingly other than that male teachers
PurplePillDebate,removed,depends on the girl since humans are individuals but let me pick some random college chick wakes up at hungover walks to her bathroom puts on her face goes to starbucks to grab a drink and a scone then reaches her job at works hours changes into a slurry dress parties until am and repeats but honestly your question is stupid and you should feel bad
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill bet
PurplePillDebate,removed,when a woman wakes up they have about guys orbiting them outside their house the second they walk out the door chads go down on their knees with roses and propose to them the next thing that happens is they are given university degrees in womanalogy because of affirmative action the day in the life of a woman is going to be the same as the day in the life of a man except when they use the washroom
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah you dont
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh its still a sore spot eh
PurplePillDebate,removed,wait do you think i care about your gender
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont know what fucking bog you crawled out of but his description was fairly accurate most women arent bear grylls
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one gives a crap
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is the correct answer women are completely oblivious to the how soul crushingly alone and ignored many men are or they hamster it away with just world fallacies obviously hes gotta be a really awful guy if hes that lonely i mean look at me im nothing special and lots of people are nice to me d men get irritated when those same women who are fed constant validation start bitching about how lonely and unappreciated they are i laughed when my roommates girlfriend recently fished for sympathy on facebook by complaining about feeling depressed and alone women are weak boring neurotic basket cases that sustain themselves on drugs and alcohol
PurplePillDebate,removed,👌👌👌👌
PurplePillDebate,removed,sheesh calm your tits babe
PurplePillDebate,removed,lel
PurplePillDebate,removed,i love it when people create entire threads to reply to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,geez mom he started it
PurplePillDebate,removed,the combination of the higher standard of beauty and baseline of wealth creation would contribute to the phenomena youre describing as it not just being more difficult how about this tweak
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have nothing against trannies at all but the way you brag about it like a snowflake fashion statement is exactly what sjws do serious question are you on tumblr
PurplePillDebate,removed,youd fit in well there is all im sayin
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you going to insult dictionarycom as well words have meaning stop misusing them to fulfill your crazy sjw fantasies
PurplePillDebate,removed,can i still be a rpw if my husband loves my sjw aesthetic colored hair catseye glasses and all votes democrat and doesnt enjoy animalistic violent sex no coloured hair is an affront to men as are tatts and body piercings and you should vote what your husband does and any woman who doesnt enjoy animalistic violent sex is not a real woman straight from the trp handbook youre welcome
PurplePillDebate,removed,in fact some of them are as physically attractive as me id bet so you are admitting you actually have no clue what you are talking about here and are just pulling shit out of your ass for the sake of arguing whatever you want to believe okay if there was a girl where you lived that looked like you and only charged an eighth of the price im sure shed get a lot more clients even if she was a lot less educated and cultured than you think you are like im really supposed to believe men give much of a shit about that when it comes to looking for a hooker lol in fact she might even be taking virtually all your potential clients and youd be making a lot less money than you could be but seeing as how that kind of business is kept on the down low youd probably not even have any way of knowing either its like chanel doesnt really affect marc jacobs ability to sell bags how would you know that seems awfully counterintuitive to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh goody a stalker i love me a stalker
PurplePillDebate,removed,you were banned for thinking the little redpillfemales want advice from a proudly open degenerate polyamorous nonmongamous freak newsflash they dont take your bizarre blatherings back to rincest rpolyamory and rredpillwomen its appreciated there
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes this is a debate sub we already covered you cant debate as debating would require you to refute andor prove with sources of what one said was wrong you did neither
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont confuse him with the facts this isnt about purity this is about men are more good than women
PurplePillDebate,removed,talking is not a need but a strong desire maybe he just doesnt feel like talking maybe hes not in the mood if ops and yours hamster can take full advantage of plausible deniability to gain power and deny needs while meeting your own to maintain power and garner as much control resources sympathy and social standing from you go girl shit then the male point of view can use plausible deniability too dont play dumb your so stopping having sex with you is hurtful regardless of what you hamster the reasons to be i have a feeling youve hurt guys like that a lot
PurplePillDebate,removed,got it so i can ignore your personal opinion as it does not conform with my own experiences and many actual experiments at least you named yourself appropriately to be spouting pop psych rubbish
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was being sarcastic logic dictates that men cheating and male actions couldnt be the primary reason for women breaking up because lesbian relationships have the lowest breakup rates and gay relationships have the lowest most women promise not to stop fucking someone when they get married they stop fucking him knowing theyre betraying his trust and not caring enough to be honest in their wedding vows and leave him before marriage instead of divorce raping him completely the same situation so why do women make bullshit promises to meet someones needs and break them but men arent allowed to meet their own needs only a woman who has done this to men would defend this this isnt an attack its fact
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah im not sure why you are arguing it either you probably shouldnt have started
PurplePillDebate,removed,beep beep beep
PurplePillDebate,removed,i would go to whichever club i enjoy and feel comfortable in i think yer doing it wrong
PurplePillDebate,removed,then he has a selfesteem problem and needs to see a psychiatrist

PurplePillDebate,removed,for women lol redpill confirmed on accident
PurplePillDebate,removed,im saying this as a person who has gone five years between boyfriends with no male attention whatsoever so you were grossly unattractive meaning my foot was well out of any doors by your own hand its really not that big of a part of life for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,please take your delusional crazy ass back to the incel forum or to a mental institute far away from here i am tired of seeing you
PurplePillDebate,removed,these girls believe what feminists tell them about interactions with men and then they project these delusional dynamics upon benign situation
PurplePillDebate,removed,who the fuck offers up a litany of their lifes tragedies to every douchebag for inspection to see if it really counts
PurplePillDebate,removed,when youre agreeing with a psycho like that you know theres an imbalance in your head somewhere
PurplePillDebate,removed,explain yourself sugar
PurplePillDebate,removed,self improvement xd all i see here is a fucked up child
PurplePillDebate,removed,shut the fuck up you aint fixin nothin
PurplePillDebate,removed,cold and calculating yall see this shit like were some wolves hunting deer or something xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,ooh im so afraid of myself wait let me get my beta stick shoots raybeam at you send me a walmart gift card cuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,speak in little words idk what the hell youre trying to say
PurplePillDebate,removed,women are childish and pathetic when they are stumped in other news water is wet
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh youre obsessed with me too
PurplePillDebate,removed,pretty much in order to attract a woman you have to have something about you thats attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think its about looks entirely i think your personality matters too i dont know what you look like and im not going to unless i saw a picture of you which obviously isnt going to happen so theres not that much point speculating finding a boyfriend online without having ever seen his face is highly abnormal for any healthy averagelooking woman which makes me suspect that youre probably lower than average looks with an unappealing personality and probably have some serious mental health issues youre bullshitting everyone here by pretending or obscuring the fact that youre just a fairly normal woman who happened to fall in love with this guy online this is not the behavior of a healthy welladjusted woman if you actually are even remotely physically attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,asians dont count give your muslims time they will be a problem
PurplePillDebate,removed,so your sample size of women is and thats your mother right i know if you fully believe in awalt this logic makes sense but please leave your house and talk to a few more women
PurplePillDebate,removed,the statement different people being attracted to different things is bullshit is so easily disproved that it isnt worth any discussion hmm lets see how i could disprove it lets see gay men like different things than straight men i already disproved it with one line wooooow but theres more straight men like different things than straight women woooopiee doooo wow that was seriously super hard come on just the fact that some guys like blondes and that others like asians should be obvious enough to disprove it but yeah please try to prove to me that all women or rather all people even trpers without exception are attracted to the same type of alpha chad you realize that this terpy we know the one true truth way of understanding attraction is extremely laughable to anyone that ever talked to more than two women right i mean im usually not one that is for basement neckbeard shaming but if you seriously believe that every woman is into the exact same type of guy then you clearly have never left your house never if you have ever left your home you should have noticed that most women date in their niches and that they disagree on what guys are attractive but you are still trying to tell me that all women no matter if they are hipsters emos punks or even lesbians are secretly into the same type of guy you know ive left my house a couple of times and i know that the women that i pick up are often the same as the women that my close friends pick up because we are very similar and are attracted to a similar type of women but because i did leave my house at least once i also know that guys that are totally different to me pick up chicks that wouldnt be attracted to me and i wouldnt be interested in them but yeah please continue to believe that literally everyone is in love with that fake alpha chad impression that trp teached you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah that paragraph reeks of bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh yeahhhh they never thought men would catch on theres no looking back now
PurplePillDebate,removed,did you just report my post why would you do that instead of responding to me calling you out for obviously bullshitting me about the nature of your relationship above average looking kooky girl falls in love with insecure guy online without ever seeing his face and this guy just has nooooo interest in trying to make you dependent on him whatsoever so you can wallow in your mutual neurosis for the rest of your lives no one believes this shit because it doesnt happen youre obviously hiding something and bullshitting everyone
PurplePillDebate,removed,sorry bro lost me at cuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,but you do know the reason he wasis interested in you iswas because of your mental health problems right
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh my god thats so interesting and definitely not bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes insecure men go after kooky mentally unhealthy women as a means of shooting higher up the smv scale and locking a woman into codependence i never said it was a conscious decision on his part but it is what it is he would never have even spoken to you if you didnt have a vagina above average looking healthy women dont find their boyfriends online without having seen their face just because they share common interests you are bullshitting me please stop
PurplePillDebate,removed,a beta is actually a semisuccessful male in the sense that he probably has had one or two real live actual relationships and maybe even a fling or two to boot an omega is a throwaway male castoff whos essentially been wiped clean from the human gene pool barring a jarring lifealtering nieztschean moment of existential crisis propelling him to take one last gasp at making it with a female i agree with your premise
PurplePillDebate,removed,if the word cuck is enough to reduce you to bitter salty incoherent ranting then you really dont have a leg to stand on
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah beta gets thrown around a lot in a negative fashion but it really isnt that awful most betas are successful in life and get some intimacy at some point theyre not socially retarded omegas on the other hand are much rarer and you can usually pick them out of a crowd im sure you remember the weirdos from hs theyre about as close to hopeless as you can get
PurplePillDebate,removed,and you still have not answered my question horse shit i just answered it twice what are the slurs you can use to put a man in his place men being shamed for being effeminate is the exact same thing as women being shamed for being sexually active shaming based on what is socially acceptable but you realized how stupid your argument was and immediately moved the goal posts bbbut those insults shame men for violating an explicit social dichotomy of manly mangirly girl so i wont allow them to count no one insults men for acting normal just like no one insults women for acting normal men get over it women cry until someone goes over to comfort them there was no implication from me i know plenty of male submissives irl theres no shame in that game you got triggered pretty quickly tho youre a passive aggressive liar and a shitty human being i just remind you of it when i see you start shitting yourself all over the place i would think some guy in his would have better things to do than goad arguments with children on a shitty website talking about sex
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre female and are always going to react negativrly to anything you perceive as a threat so who really gives a shit its not about you its about men rp men dont give a fuck what your preferences or reactions may be its about men
PurplePillDebate,removed,because women are worse than men insults are insults men deal with them women cry
PurplePillDebate,removed,try to argue or fuck off masking your anger and pretending to totally not care makes you a woman be a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not saying your lifestyle is necessarily shit or even that he is necessarily bad for your happiness but sexually you are unhealthy because youre unable to properly follow the female sexual imperative youre depressed yeah whats your problem
PurplePillDebate,removed,this post was ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,removed,well no bpers are simply wrong they are often confused by reality and scared of the people who accept it
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is an example of that passive aggression for anyone reading notice how hes framed his comment in a way that makes it impossible for me to respond without receiving any and all blame for escalation he does this because he doesnt know how to argue i prefer direct insults because im not a woman and dont be fooled hes trying very hard to seem like he doesnt care
PurplePillDebate,removed,no not necessarily there are a number of ways that a woman can pursue her sexual imperative trying to figure out whats wrong with you if you dont want to tell me then thats fine but its not really helpful
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh ok bye
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you have to ask youl never know
PurplePillDebate,removed,its going from satire to raging in seconds that demonatrates bluepullers threated position theyre on edge
PurplePillDebate,removed,absolutely women are never responsible for their decisions while drunk treat all sex as rape widen the divide between the sexes breed misogyny
PurplePillDebate,removed,yep as we discovered from the other thread about the paucity of bp advice men dont have a right to advice as some blue pill lady said
PurplePillDebate,removed,sooo how is that any different than what im doing except that its easier for me not to stray because for whatever reason youre not capable of experiencing the normal sexual attraction to men that allows you to properly follow your sexual imperative if you didnt have this problem you could have gotten a better man and yeah i know blah blah youre happy with him and so on but evolution doesnt care because this whole experience has made me believe that soulmates are just a thing but thats completely fucking stupid this would be easier if your husband could answer questions too and if it were in person to be honest i dont think youre willing to answer honestly at all so this is not really a useful discussion are you a professional therapist or something obviously not
PurplePillDebate,removed,its called awareness honey lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,who gives a fuck about holding frame
PurplePillDebate,removed,and who gives a fuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol why are you so scared do you need me to teach you again that women dont like le nice guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,colder colder
PurplePillDebate,removed,what exactly were you being colloquial about is this like a terrible shitty i mispoke excuse designed to be a standin for i am incapable of understanding or accepting that women too might have problems because i am really entrenched in my unsubstantiated pov
PurplePillDebate,removed,delusions of grandeur
PurplePillDebate,removed,look believe me i wish you both all the best in your relationship im just trying to get to the root of it now that youve explained a bit more it makes sense im sorry for being so pushy youre still an unhealthy female though
PurplePillDebate,removed,no u
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre saying red pillers should be racist and sexist lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre right
PurplePillDebate,removed,trpincels in a nutshell get the fuck outta here attractive people like attractive people yall act like its the end of the world that hot chicks dont want to touch your dusty neckbeard dick
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is just gibberish feminism you debate like a religious zealot
PurplePillDebate,removed,now youre just being ignorant and using strawman arguments what are you trying to communicate
PurplePillDebate,removed,you know that was a bot right not the guy you replied to initially
PurplePillDebate,removed,butthurt studies imo with an emphasis on triggleypuff
PurplePillDebate,removed,what femspeak is hard to comprehend
PurplePillDebate,removed,check your native english speaker privilege shitlord
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you end up with an impaction due to all the anally retentive butthurt you are full of who is going to administer the enema and disimpact your colon
PurplePillDebate,removed,no
PurplePillDebate,removed,because feminism is about being against white males
PurplePillDebate,removed,getting ready to watch the hamster spin
PurplePillDebate,removed,because not all religion is fundamentalist its like asking how i can have mormon friends when the flds exists
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was reading a sjw forum and they were claiming that only a small fraction like of muslims are potentially dangerous to women while or so of western men harass and discriminate everyday they really hamsterize like champions in a hamster contest
PurplePillDebate,removed,probably because i care about more than just one issue yes it is true that i value womens rights very highly but that doesnt mean that i am myopic enough to preclude me from also combatting other issues such as religious or ethnic discrimination also thats not necessarily a valid interpretation of sharia law sure saudi arabia bans women from driving and requires women to wear a niqab in public but thats pertinent to saudi arabia not islamic interpretation of sharia as a whole ive met muslim women who are oppressed and ive worked along side brilliant and empowered muslim women who are doctors and politicians some of whom chose to not wear hijab after all the hadith regarding female dress only stipulates the covering of the hair and the use of a flowing cloth do i personally agree with mainstream islamic treatment of women no do i think that muslims deserve stigmatization as a result also no
PurplePillDebate,removed,im a feminist and of course i dont support sharia law i think a lot of people dont understand the feminist label are you basing this observation off tumblr blogs from angsty teenagers or actual respected educated feminists
PurplePillDebate,removed,all religions are sexist the only difference between christianity and islam is that feminists have been pushing christianity for decades if not centuries to become less sexist so i support muslim feminists in pushing islam to become less sexist in addition i dont support unfairly discriminating against and stereotyping people even if theyre sexist
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am not supportive of fundamentalist islam it is horrendously sexist among a lot of other things what i support is people people should not be discriminated against and hated on there is also the practical issue in that trying to force them into our views has not been historically successful in fact springing up antiwesternism we kind of need to let them realize how stupid their culture is on their own
PurplePillDebate,removed,how can you support christianity when christian men are sexist or when some of christian teachings are used to promise sexist or other bigoted beliefs how about how many flavors of christianity that still wont let a woman serve as priest or any position of power or how its the christians that are waging war in america against womens reproductive rights and body autonomy personally im atheist so while i support everyones right to any belief system they choose i dont have to agree with the parts of their belief systems which are sexist or otherwise bigoted hate is not a family value imo
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes a big scary to be so overflowing with rage he reminds me of what eliot roger might sound like eliot is the and associated with the redpillers he needs therapy im guessing hes from a seriously dysfunctional home to have that extremely unhealthy view of others perhaps he doesnt have any good role models in his life perhaps he felt his own mother was abusive and rather than acknowledge her individually its just easier to hate all women everywhere
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont support islam im not a proponent of any organised religion many feminists especially radical feminists are also heavily critical of islam i do think that you can be critical of a religion while still being open minded about certain individuals in that faith not fitting the mould though while in an ideal world islam wouldnt exist since we dont live in that ideal world we should instead reward and publicize the softer elements within the community to encourage them to moderate the rest
PurplePillDebate,removed,is ugavinok a ppd question generating bot which one of you degenerates programmed him
PurplePillDebate,removed,the bible is extremely sexist and many christian men are sexists it doesnt mean you should condemn an entire religion
PurplePillDebate,removed,this isnt true islam was sexist since its founding by muhammad in ad its just worse now because zealous religious dictatorships have come to power within the past century if you read the history of sharia law you would see that the misogyny was always there since the beginning
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont most of them are come from degenerate world countries with regressive values so fuck em most of the new years attackers were from north africa not even from seryia they have no intention of assimilating in to the dominate culture so they dotn wantot adopt western values and rape and sexual abuse men and women children like in rotherdam naw fuck em let them shit up their own countries
PurplePillDebate,removed,then youre talking about something irrelevant to this thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,breaking a few eggs can soon turn into destabilizing an entire country also maybe im an idiot but im also dumb
PurplePillDebate,removed,im a feminist but i dont represent or affiliate with a specific organization and i dont support the misogynistic aspects of islam or nations that enforce sharia law feminism means different things to different people and encompasses a wide group of people youll be hard pressed to find a topic every selfproclaimed feminist agrees with besides maybe men and women are equal its another way of saying i dont agree with what you assume i believe so i cant explain it to you youll get more meaningful debate if you start the conversation without assumptions about the other sides viewpoint
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont while i believe in freedom of worship i think the world would be a better place without religion
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont support islam in fact i criticize it however i do support people who choose to follow the religion as long as they dont try and influence me i am against forced religion i personally think it should be against the law to take a child to church before they are and can legally make the choice themselves i am against sexist laws and for seperation of churchstate if women are freely going into a religion that i consider oppressive i respect their choices i might not agree with it but as long as they keep to themselves and dont try and influence my country then fine
PurplePillDebate,removed,muslim feminists have made it pretty clear that while allies are important they dont need or want white women barging in and trying to fix all their problems for them this is a pretty hot topic within western feminism and i see plenty of support for muslim women in the circles i run in being a supporter does not mean tearing down an entire religion
PurplePillDebate,removed,firstly i dont support islam i support the right of muslims to practice their religion without having to endure hate speech from bigots second there are many different interpretations of islam muslims in america are generally very conservative but i wouldnt call the majority of them particularly sexist patriarchal sure but not trp level sexist
PurplePillDebate,removed,bluepillers think gender relationships are perfectly fine except for men not checking their privilege and making more room for women eliot rodger was more of a blackpiller
PurplePillDebate,removed,elliot rogers was rich and he wasnt even that bad looking it tells you how bad his personality had to be to keep getting rejected
PurplePillDebate,removed,actually an employer would be more likely to call me as women are smarter more educated and generally more pleasant to be around this is also why rich people tend to have daughters while poor people tend to have sons
PurplePillDebate,removed,she is fucking other guys behind your back regardless of your insecurities
PurplePillDebate,removed,elliot rodger was red pill all the way even though he claimed to be better the things he said and his hatred of women are pure red pill learn to accept women as flawed beings ahahahahaha all red pill does is bitch about women while claiming to accept them pull the other leg it plays the trper theme song red pill must know theyre not fooling anyone i mean cmon none of you trpers do take the red pill seriously do you its a support group for men who are failing with women which is fine and dandy but it cant claim to be anything else
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp spews hate on a daily basis so does tbp they spew pure rage over trp then call it satire there is no satire here just pure rage and hate
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,introspection is a lost art oh good lord the irony i think i may die
PurplePillDebate,removed,a lot of solo self loving in the future p im sure they will complete with tissues and lube
PurplePillDebate,removed,how did that piece of beef jerky become sentient i wonder if its teriyaki or pepper flavored
PurplePillDebate,removed,you lot really are condescending
PurplePillDebate,removed,why would women lie lmao isnt that the age old question right there
PurplePillDebate,removed,tatum is some beta cuck that the women all went crazy for due to his photoshopped magic mike appearance dude plays for both teams as well
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive never seen anyone use snark with someone they actually pity feigning pity a form of snark for someone you hate all the time
PurplePillDebate,removed,yea havent you read any of my posts a descent into the ciswhitemaelström the masque of the red pill death the fall of the house of gaylubeoil the facts in the fr of m valdemar
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe your ugly
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one cares what feminists bloopers like
PurplePillDebate,removed,a list of hateful insults concluded with a final insult oh yea pityi totally see it s
PurplePillDebate,removed,somehow i dont believe you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know about of them who definitely are oh yeah you know them all of them by name thats impressive
PurplePillDebate,removed,not anyone important mostly fatties and ugly people
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre going to try to tell me that horrible with women desperate extremely awkward sad lonely selfentitled asshole relationshipruiner friendless sad again lonely again arent insults this is textbook gaslighting youre being a dick i and everyone else can see youre being a dick but noooo theres something wrong with my sensesyou really just feel bad for me sure pal i believe you
PurplePillDebate,removed,im really sorry that i cant quote an insane killer off the top of my head pls forgive me bb
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes
PurplePillDebate,removed,guy here were i in your shoes i would dress sharp i rocked the sweatpants look back in the day and i guess got a little pussy but once i started dressing nicely and trimming the beard and wearing nicer clothes i definitely got a lot more female attention
PurplePillDebate,removed,go for the surprise full monty youve got a fifty fifty shot that way
PurplePillDebate,removed,is this where prime fertile submissive girls live at i bring my gym bro chad muscles and my tiny dick as a side chick haha
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are you so arrogant
PurplePillDebate,removed,leave your lil safe space every once in a while
PurplePillDebate,removed,funny you would say that you sound butthurt every comment ive ever seen you write
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not american but i identify as an old stock american of scotchirish and algonquiancherokee ancestry from appalachia after all ethnicity is just a social construct so i can claim whatever ancestry i want
PurplePillDebate,removed,the uncomfortable truth that you refuse to acknowledge is that black people commit the overwhelming majority of crimes with that context permitted to be recognized in the discussion it actually makes perfect sense that police are going to focus on those communities and on average they do a bangup job all things considered such as the inherent imperfection of human beings yes hispanics and blacks suffer more use of force incidents than whites or asians the two groups that commit the least amount of crime shocker but fatal shootings are pretty much when adjusted to the population share of each group which pretty much undermines blms core argument that this is a horrible racist country where black people are murdered on sight
PurplePillDebate,removed,one visit to the altright sub proves that to be false bullshit the altright is only a thing because sjws such as yourself make an exception for some groups to play racial politics and then freak out when whites do it whites are unique in the history of the world of first attempting to create a postracial society youre just salty that your deliberate attempts to divide people on racial and sexual lines has mobilized whites to do precisely the same thing
PurplePillDebate,removed,obtuse much
PurplePillDebate,removed,holy cow thats some super autism youve got there if youd like to make a more accurate blog post of the average american go for it
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you in middle school
PurplePillDebate,removed,what about the guy telling me about my low standards that im projecting if hes entitled to say that i dont see why im not able to say what i did
PurplePillDebate,removed,dude you just asked them a question and then told them to shut up when they obliged you
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes
PurplePillDebate,removed,ded
PurplePillDebate,removed,if men want to be as successful as women they should start working harder when i graduated high school we had valedictorians students who all had gpas and every single one of them was a girl we also had only students who played varsity sports for every year of high school and every one of them was also a girl this was in a school with male students our female sports teams went to champonships and won titles and our entire student govt was run by female students while the majority of guys i saw just hung out with their friends and got high everyday dont complain about guys underachieving in life and being homeless if theyre not going to put in the same effort as women
PurplePillDebate,removed,simple for the same reason feminists go around saying that porn is evil and that sexbots will destroy civilization and hence should be banned its all about control trp and many other such movements that shun the overwhelmingly gynocentric culture of the modern world will always be demonized and looked down upon since the very existence of these movements spit in the face of the demanded gynocentric mandate in short they demonize it because they cannot fight it with logic facts or reason and they want to fight it because it takes away their control over men and allows men to break out of the millions of years of indentured servitude that women and the gynocentric society as a whole has benefited from after all if you have a slave the last thing you want is for your slaves to get together and talk about freedom
PurplePillDebate,removed,people are still claiming that this is happening even though no ine could provide proof there are literally a bazillion links if you just google it it took me secs to find proof if you follow the links the campaign is being spearheaded by the single largest feminist organization around there are about a thousand other stories just like this i find it funny how people dont even bother to look at the evidence when its provided then sit around and say lololol no proof you realize it just makes yall look foolish right when you just ignore the proof provided and then pretend like none was given
PurplePillDebate,removed,please please be a joke please please have an actual point to make this is after all purplepilldebate if your idea of a debate is to make cringey preadolescent statements that dont even form a cogent point then perhaps you best go back to tumblr little one and let the adults talk
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really need to calm down ah yes the good ol let me tell him to calm down since i have no real argument to make lol im perfectly calm little one thanks though i was merely pointing out how silly you make yourself look when you act childish especially in a forum specifically designed for adult conversation the fact that you took that and decided to play the lol ill pretend like hes being all emotional so i can tell him to calm down literally just proves my point about your childishness so yea this is your last warning either contribute to the discussion at hand or leave no need to spew nonsense into a thread simply to derail it and please leave out the personal attacks absolutely pointless to insult me
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was talking about the thread not google wait did you just say that you ignore proof that comes from google even when i linked you an article from the bbc rofl let me guess you only accept proof from your heavy handed feminist websites eh lol you are so tragic but yea its clear you are just a shtposter next to the op its folks like these who demonize trp as this lady has clearly demonstrated she is incapable of having an adult conversation and so devolved the conversation into childish remarks personal attacks and now this is her playing the im a victim card by pretending that the bbc is some crazy organization oppressing her with popupads how pointlessly tragic
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh let me guess you are the poor little victim here yes i love how you have to resort to outright lying now i like how you are playing the im a little victim card simply to detract from the point that i just destroyed your argument youre the one calling me a child for simply disagreeing with you im calling you a child because you are acting like one you cannot disagree with facts you said there is no proof that feminists are trying to get sexbots banned i directly linked the proof that they are you say i disagree with your proof that is how a child acts when they disregard reality in favor of their silly fantasy world the same fantasy world that has you going around pretending to be a hapless victim so yea either grow up and face the reality that your silly opinion was negated by fact or just leave i mean i dunno wtf you are still doing in this thread probably trying to get more victim points its kinda disgusting really not to mention unhealthy
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think youre trying to hard to miss the point or invalidate that someone else is disrespected because youve hamstered that because you dont view it as disrespectful no one else should either which is just weird and narcissistic carry on solipsibro
PurplePillDebate,removed,funny i havent even posted on your sub since i was warned by the other mod yet you felt you need to come in here and threaten me again what i find even more interesting is that usensen is hurling abuse my way isnt even on topic for the thread at hand is clearly derailing the thread and is outright lying yet none of you mods even ask her to stop or give her a warning let alone the two warnings and threats youve sent my way she is openly lying saying that im abusing her when all im asking her to do is act like an adult yet somehow because she feels triggered i have to pretend like the proof im providing doesnt exist interesting i guess you learn something new every day dont disagree with women on rpurplepilldebate otherwise you will be accused of being an abuser and the mods will start threatening you so transparent but please keep sending more threats my way rollseyes
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont know why youre having such a strong reaction to someone just disagreeing with you is it possible for you to have a mature adult discussion without pretending to be a victim of an attack simply because i provided facts that negate your narrative if your answer to that question is yes then we can talk but so far it has been no i find it hilarious that even after i told you im not having a strong reaction you felt the need to negate my experience and you felt you somehow have the authority to define my own feelings lol what is most telling is how you have completely abandoned the topic of discussion now and instead are focused on how much of a victim you now are do you not see how transparent your behavior is
PurplePillDebate,removed,she didnt give him a blowie at pm in the middle of her birthday party with all of her friends there to watch dread game her
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok there bub lol i guess you think your mod status allows you to redefine the english language to serve your agenda and narrative facepalm so pointlessly tragic stop negating our narratives or you will be banned sounds like a perfectly decent threat to me shrugs but yes please keep on informing me about the consequences of my behavior lol a sub with the word debate in it having mods who squelch debate based on their narratives and based off of the feelings of a few female users i dont think the irony gets sweeter lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,reasonably so sorta hard to say shit like that in and get away with it funny in its apparently unacceptable to call women out who are acting childish but its so easy and perfectly acceptable to go around calling all men douchebags or rapists or misogynists kinda lays out the double standards bare doesnt it but do the bloopers care oh no they have to ignore the double standards otherwise their little neolib brains would implode lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you cant debate without being condescending and rude this isnt the sub for you simple so when usensen negates my personal experience and feels she has the right to define my emotional state even after i have told her that her assertion about my emotional state is false that isnt a problem for you eh even though that action by her is directly a blatant violation of the rules one the sidebar of this very subreddit but hey she is just a victimized woman right lol even though all that is happening im the one breaking the rules so there is a rule that says if usensen says you are being emotional you have to agree with her even if you arent if so please show me this rule because that is the only rule i broke no one gets to negate another persons experience no one gets to define another persons emotional state especially after that person has categorically told them that their assumption about that state is wrong these are the basic rules of reddit that you witnessed her violate yet you still decided to come and harp on me and falsely accuse me if you cannot look at a situation with impartiality you shouldnt be a mod she has blatantly violated the basic rules of reddit etiquette she is arguing in bad faith and she is verbally attacking me she is negating my experience yet you still felt the need to protect her coz she is the victim so yea what you are doing is transparent here no need to try to control the narrative its pretty clear you cannot control the narrative when the format is text anyone with a brain can scroll up and realize that my comments are not uncivil its not uncivil to disagree with someone who is asserting something about your emotional state im not being uncivil simply because i disagreed that someone else gets to define what im feeling but hey please keep accusing me of doing things that i havent whatever makes you sleep at night gramps
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you think it would be easier or harder for a male to court a woman that is clearly a notch or two below his smv level totally depends on the male or more specifically it depends where on the smv scale the male is currently at if you are a middling to low smv male then dating a girl lower than you will be easier but not trivial if you are a midhigh smv male then dating a girl lower than you will be trivial if you are a high smv male then dating a girl lower than you will be difficult but mainly due to you having to put in extra effort to counterbalance the damage dating the low smv girl will do to your own smv for women the arithmetic is much simpler as a women its trivial to date a man with lower smv than you women face zero to no difficulty in the dating world reams and reams of scientific evidence has proved this one of the top stories in this very subreddit right now has a massive set of linksproof the only time women have difficulty in dating is when they have a significantly lower smv than the guy
PurplePillDebate,removed,this its pretty clear cut and the evidence is pretty overwhelming heck historically of men didnt even reproduce of men were historically forever alone in fact if we look at this across the history of the species mens default status is forever alone we have been doing it for millennia as it is people forget monogamy is but a blip on the radar in the grander terms the men of humanity have by and large been forever alone much longer than monogamy was even around
PurplePillDebate,removed,men taking the super hand on a relationship is abuse now period
PurplePillDebate,removed,how many bullets have you personally taken for women for me the most important reason to care about women in my life is because i like to do it this only indicates that even though you like to sport that redpill tag you still have to unlearn some gynocentric conditioning why because those same women for whom you would like to take a bullet for yea they wouldnt take a bullet for you lol in fact they expect you to die for them not the other way around gynocentric society is what has made you think you would like to take a bullet for a woman gynocentric society is what has convinced you that even though you will be nothing more than a puddle of guts and blood lying and dying on the floor facing imminent and eternal darkness that somehow the momentary feels that you would get for dying for some woman before your entire existence is erased somehow counterbalances the fact that you just wasted your life and will face nothing more than the infinite void in short its a sick cruel joke but yea the whole men must die for women is one of the oldest of the lies we are told due to this its one of the hardest to unlearn personally i never understood how women keep harping on about how men dont do anything for them only to ignore the billions of men who have died for women throughout history but meh rationale was never their strong suit lol p
PurplePillDebate,removed,why is this ridiculous rant not being deleted there are no questions no theory no cmv its just some sad sack throwing a pity party and blaming women for the fact that adulting is hard get this shit over to red pill where it belongs
PurplePillDebate,removed,two questions are you a time traveler from the do you keep optimized smv courtship interface percentages in spreadsheet form or do you write your own algorithms
PurplePillDebate,removed,what do you mean you dont want another man to fuck your wife its dont you know its the currentyearmoderfuka
PurplePillDebate,removed,i didnt say it never happens i just thought he was overly dramatic for no good reason yea this just proves my suspicion you are basically a blue piller trying to pass off as a redpiller yet still making bluepill comments the fact that you completely missed the point other folks got easily only goes to prove this further the point being that you cannot consider yourself free of gynocentric male slave programming and still hold the value of men should die for women the two concepts are immiscible by definition you cannot subscribe to both it is a contradiction nothin gin there is dramatic nothing in there has anything to do with internalized misandry which is simply a silly phrase feminists make up the internalized misoginy version the simple fact that you are even resorting to using feminist shame tactics just goes to show how far off the bloopend you really are but yea women in todays day and age dont stand up for men the simple fact that you think men should stand up for women proves my point that you are just another neolib blooper one who has put women on such a high pedestal that you are willing to face the infinite void of death simply for da feelz its absurd and yes if i saw a woman being attacked i wouldnt do a damn thing why should i bother to save a woman only to have her turn around and call me a misogynist rapist simply for having a penis lol no thanks why should i sacrifice my life the only one ive got mind you for some thankless woman who feels entitled to have men die for her lol no thanks why should a man any man put himself in harms way for a woman who would never do the same lol no fucking thanks that is the simple fact you and feminist like you do not get you want equality here it is so long as women stand around and do nothing to help men so long as women stand around and demand men pay for their mistakes so long as women keep blaming men for problems that women cause any man who dies for a woman is the biggest fucking fool on the planet all these idiots killing themselves for women who themselves dont even give a shit or even remember the name of the man who died for them its so pathetic but that is why the conditioning for it is so strong
PurplePillDebate,removed,the fact that you are constantly ignoring that women dont show any expression of empathy towards men let alone taking a bullet and are still demanding men to show empathy for women doesnt seem a bit odd to you the fact that in your world its ok that women show no empathy towards men but men are obligated to show empathy towards women doesnt seem a bit odd to you lol neolibs nowadays beaten by their own faulty logic lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,you arent trping right if you help another human being that happens to be a woman regardless of whether or not you would do the same thing to help a man ah yes here she is the girl who has been stalking my posts and downvote brigading me all day nice to see you here again ms victim complex tell me why is it that when a woman is in trouble you suddenly bust out the whole oh look another human being is in trouble and this man isnt helping narrative of humanizing the victim but when a man is in trouble you are all oh men are just pigs they should know better men dont deserve any help i mean your own posting history is chock full of this double standard but to you its perfectly ok lol what a classic example of male disposability mentality you cannot even answer the basic question yet you still feel you can come in here and insult me how quaint no doubt you will now go cry to the mods about how im victimizing you pathetic really but yea in all your crying about how men victimize you you still havent answered the question its really simple so i dont know why you keep ignoring it here it is again just for you why should a man sacrifice himself for a woman when women do not sacrifice for men why should a husband take a bullet for his wife when his wife would not do the same your feminist hamstering is literally preventing you even acknowledging the question and you come in here and pretend like you are contributing something to the conversation with your childish attitude but please go cry to the mods now how pointlessly tragic your existence is that you stalk people online and then try to squelch them lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are not obligated to do shit oh please spare me your bloopy nonsense you are the one pushing the obligation i just disproved your shoddy and weak rationale for it destroying your arguments if they can even be called that for why men should protect teh wimmenz and now you are just backtracking coz you dont have an answer to the basic point why should men sacrifice for women when women do not sacrifice for men or put in more neolib bloop friendly terms why should men even give a basic shit about women when women have proved that they do not care about anything but themselves your ranting and crying and other failed attempts to detract from your inability to answer this very basic questions only goes to show how tenuous even you think your position is
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol wat you removed the comments just coz they go against the narrative why have a place for people to debate then go around deleting the arguments that go against your narrative lol no wonder the rest of reddit sees this place as a joke you have mods going around deleting messages giving zero reasons for folks who simply disagree that women are inherently wonderful but then one sees your posting history and it all becomes clear i mean ffs can you be more bias i mean ffs just your massive diatribe in the what dont you like about trp which was basically just a massive shtpost is all the proof someone needs maybe you need to get back to your vacation from ppd coz its borderline retarded to have a forum that claims to be open to debates but then go around banning deleing anyone whose opinion you do not agree with i mean ffs instead of flaunting your ban stick and your moderator epeen why dont you like you know actually make a fucking counterargument thats the problem with you neolib bloopers you think that by thretening people you are somehow making a valid argument you do realize that any person with even a semblance of a brain cell can tell the difference right like they can see right through your little ploy here make a valid counterargument or dont post at all but going around threatening people simply coz you dont agree with them and you dont have the tact or skill to formulate a counterargument is just bad form
PurplePillDebate,removed,leave the house with a skirt on
PurplePillDebate,removed,when you really like someone wait a bit to have sex if you want an actual relationship i have converted all of my friends to this rule wait at least dates and wait until you both agree not to have sex with others this allows the person that you are seeing to fall for more than just your body this only works if youve never had casual sex if a girl made me wait for sex but i learned she had had sex with b other guys and not made then wait i would drop her and never look back
PurplePillDebate,removed,kay
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh wow good for you have a pat on the back
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think any website has a higher rate of aspergersautism than reddit so many wierdos like you here
PurplePillDebate,removed,something just occurred to me trp always seems to present awalt as a negative thing however me not being like that apparently makes me unattractive what gives guys i dont experience hypergamy i dont want to fuck loads of different alpha dudes andor ride the cock carousel i dont expect a guy to be rich or even have a job and i like skinny beta nerds who are virgins is it just the whole strapon thing cause yknow its not a dealbreaker for me just something im lowkey into not that i would want to be with the average trp guy im just amused by this because i feel trps aversion to me as a potential mate is ironic in some aspects
PurplePillDebate,removed,he is short and asian you wouldnt actually message him because you wont be attracted to him you would assume he has a small dick and that no women would date him and also find him a little worse than an exactly similar white guy thats my version of red pill
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats all stupid shit tho and our black population drags down or national average seriously who the fuck cares about things lie tolerance the middle class in america most likely has the highest standard of living in the world we just have a few crappy ethic cities that make our country look bad as a whole
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes i am being a bit trolly
PurplePillDebate,removed,only reason were not together now is because hes hurt me time and time again and he has serious issues that i probably cant help him with see like i said awalt women wont tolerate losers thats why most divorces are filed by women not by men
PurplePillDebate,removed,but when jars need opening and spiders need killing where are all the women huh op
PurplePillDebate,removed,you mean mansplain it to her
PurplePillDebate,removed,no he didnt fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant believe you said that have you always hated women or were you emboldened by trump
PurplePillDebate,removed,no because im lumped in with women for the backlash and lumped in with men for the implicit things like punishing hyperactive children so i have it worse than both men and women shut up with your snark its not amusing
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do not joke about mansplaining under the patriarchy its a proven fact that men never know better than any random woman which means any time a man explains anything to a women hes wrong
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre blue because youve never been tested youve never been challenged your life is a treadmill with easy metrics that happen with a push of a button the most you have to deal with is some guy incorrectly assuming you have a pussy mentally speaking its fairly accurate you are youre lack of insight is a clear indicator so is the mod that shows up to remind me to be pleasant rather than accurate dial down the tone says the tone police or ye shall be banished right genova prove sips right its why hes here its what devalues ppd as an actual debate and why red pill guys should search else where for better challenges
PurplePillDebate,removed,women only wanna be friends with chad thundercock s
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol yeah girls sure do run away from terpers right its not like you could say let your girl read your reddit posts right i mean could you imagine if my gf read my posts lololol why do you bloops always think that we are somehow lying to girls
PurplePillDebate,removed,only child doesnt surprise me youre a selfish motherfucker
PurplePillDebate,removed,not a man and not rp but in my experience this stuff can go both ways ive had serious boyfriends in my life and they all had at least one sister no brothers i do think it helped them relate to and feel more comfortable around women none of them were players they were all relationshiptypes they each seemed to crave female companionship over meaningless sex beyond that i dont think they had too much in common i think it probably depends on the overall family dynamic as well as his relationship with his mother though its definitely interesting for me to think about why im apparently attracted to men with sisters there must be something there i also had only sisters which might have something to do with it one thing i did notice is that the two guys with older sisters expected me to call the shots and wear the pants in the relationship im not sure how much this has to do with having older sisters my sample size is pretty biased but i wouldnt be surprised if it did
PurplePillDebate,removed,and i bet you will teach your daughters that women love being controlled
PurplePillDebate,removed,you need a drink who the fuck is bitching at you i made an observation rellax daddy isnt scolding you no one cares about you specifically
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol show me where i called you conceited becky i said that to add years to a bac and call it phd is hubris after you noted how you got there aba i made that statement in reference to the aba you taking it personally is on you dear
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats ridiculous no woman can read the amount of demeaning words verbal abuses and violent comments against women without feeling sick in their stomac there is absolutely no way for anyone to think that beyond those nasty words and dirty minds there is a soul to be saved so no dont expect empathy from people you call sluts okay so dont have compassion its hilarious really i never even told you to have compassion merely explained it yet you still got defensive and personal i have had and can have compassion for people racist and misandrist towards me because im a man and am capable of it you cannot get past your self centered and emotionally charged view of the world what a fate indeed and yet you expect me to look at you as an equal to respect you from the get go as i do other men what a joke i cant believe i honestly tried for so many years disappointing
PurplePillDebate,removed,what a productive response way to contribute
PurplePillDebate,removed,in music views since mar httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont understand in any marriage the man earned of their assets property etc thats why when they get divorced the man loses half of his things while the woman gains half of his things s
PurplePillDebate,removed,just created a post in this subreddit about the greatest sex crime prosecutor of all time saying that half of rape complaints are false you wont find it though unless you click on my pseudonym the moderators here cant handle the true and debate even appears in the title of the subreddit the moderators here are truly have very dull minds
PurplePillDebate,removed,all right i thought of a new name for you rpino red piller in name only
PurplePillDebate,removed,agreed dwayne the rock johnson is not going to get with a cute white girl from rednecksville mississippi if it happens itll be kept very secret with very very very few exceptions in places like portland or vermont you might have a better chance surprisingly a black guy or even an indian guy can do pretty well for himself in a lilywhite liberal area wherever yahoos are consciously racist and have met a decent amount of minorities youre fucked
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you can pass for white this thread doesnt apply to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,in truth they are just insecure rednecks with a low smv who need to use that kind of shit to keep their women in check high smv white men dont give a damn
PurplePillDebate,removed,most of the racist whites ive met especially white women who hated men of minority groups because of stereotypes all asians and arabs are weird were typically from upper middle class areas
PurplePillDebate,removed,just had to comment again on this perfect conprehension of the issue not only did yo nail it but you suggested the correct response if one in ten women had your wisdom then feminism would be destroyed and we can build a new golden age in gender relations on the west
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is just too funny have you ever seen what the women from those countries look like google ukranian bride as you will see it is white men who are exporting ukranian women they are the most beautiful women in the world after growing up amongst the most stunning women on the planet why on earth would a red blooded ukranian man want to touch an entitled fat lazy tinderella from the usa you have got everything assbackwards
PurplePillDebate,removed,more like a fat entitled tinderella cock carousel riders have you ever seen ukranian women not even one in ten usa women could hold a candle to them
PurplePillDebate,removed,why dont you stick your parenting advice sideways up your ass apply your parenting advice to your kids
PurplePillDebate,removed,cuntfusing was pretty clever of notch
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes clearly now fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop cuntfusing
PurplePillDebate,removed,i need to know why do you talk about someone and they when we are talking about male
PurplePillDebate,removed,pros helps me go to sleep so im well rested in the morning must be expensive getting pros to help you get to sleep every night im sorry some of them snore
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sorry i dont bother to debate vapid trolls who bring nothing to the discussion
PurplePillDebate,removed,three whats your problem that you just dont want the commentary
PurplePillDebate,removed,bluepills are not trying to offer anything as a counter theyre a mockery sub populated mostly by women who have no reason or to question or educate themselves on sociosexual dynamics and white knights who still believe inmgraciating themselves to women is the most effective way of being on the incrowd and yes some bluepill alphas who arent aware some people require education on how to be liked or attract women
PurplePillDebate,removed,but moooooooooooooom he started it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i feel like bluepill is more of a catalyst for redpill more than anything else as is the case with most thought police subs on reddit all they ever manage to accomplish is push more people to the fire that would have never gone there to begin with i also noticed they like to straddle the line between wanting to be satirical and wanting to be taken seriously if youre entire premise is founded on being a joke then why should anybody who is in the middle bother to listen to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes you are attracted to the specific list of things that i laid out except i said most of it i dont care about you ignored it goths usually arent chads because most of them have low smv so most goth guys dont have girlfriends or is there more to attraction than chadness not impressed thought you said you were impressed by stem degrees thought you said you were consistent lol your poor poor hamster ill take that as a compliment wasnt meant as such lol but you do you game doesnt necessarily involve lying what does it involve then if it isnt meant to trick women i am a grower and they still notice it lol does not compute what were those reasons one was because a friend who wasnt experienced asked about different sizes because she was curious that one didnt really have names attached the other was because a guy i had completely unrelated ons with got mad when i wouldnt make it a fwb thing and started saying some stuff about me to hurt my feelings so i did the same he was the smallest guy id been with the sex was fine i wouldnt have ever complained but i wanted to hurt him where he hurt me it was petty
PurplePillDebate,removed,traumatized rape victims are the best for a ons
PurplePillDebate,removed,you just demonstrated why you are again i thought you should be smart enough to infer why but i guess it needs to be spelled out you havent addressed anything of what i wrote in the op and instead just insulted it as long winded mental masturbation because it doesnt sit well with your feelings
PurplePillDebate,removed,i already told you now you cant read either come on
PurplePillDebate,removed,if he thought i was a poor choice he would have left hes not one to waste time
PurplePillDebate,removed,this either explains a lot or is another one of your rthathappened stories
PurplePillDebate,removed,why dont you just come out and say you dont trust him and he has to report to his mommy
PurplePillDebate,removed,this comment was removed i will reapprove it if you delete the first lines
PurplePillDebate,removed,only the sweet ones sweetie only the sweet ones
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is retarded you are knowingly lying about it and are so proud of yourself that you found a way to hamster it your potential so wants to know the number of dicks consensual or not not to mention postcoital nonconsent you technically can keep your number as low as you want and it can even decrease wtf but then again and when i have another relationship i will its not even if its when you are just coldblooded and plan all that having an actual sexual strategy instead of being genuine no wonder you dont give a fuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not fake heres more proof i like that watch
PurplePillDebate,removed,this whole thread is great haha thank you for the laughs
PurplePillDebate,removed,one of my friends is an amateur dj so that is status for me im and i bang women under all the time havent had to even touch a or woman in a year im not even that good looking just alpha af and it works for me lol sorry women reading this i would probably not bone you byeeee
PurplePillDebate,removed,who cares im not dating myself clearly tons of smoking hot year olds think i have enough to offer funny how women get less attractive as they get older and more picky lol why would i try to have something to offer women who arent even hot when smoking hot teenagers literally fling themselves at me daily trying to have sex with me and they actually buy my drinks and i had one of them mop my floor after sex literally this is not a sexual euphemism lol everyone who rejected me in hs probably feels so stupid rn
PurplePillDebate,removed,smells a lot like jealous post wall vag over here
PurplePillDebate,removed,all three believe that masculine identity is in crisis in the west they believe its been emasculated by feminism threatenend by multiculturalism enfeebled by corporate and consumer capitalism and betrayed by older men who failed to provide strong role models as a result they say western men have ended up miserable weak lonely addicted and suicidal he got that one right this is one of the major things tbp constantly misunderstands the cause and effect of the male anger it doesnt come from reading trp it comes from their real world experiences its a wonder terpers are not even more angry and if i look at trp i constantly see posts which talk men out of their anger give them direction and ways to deal with it if someone would follow that advice his anger surely will vanish if i was muslim i would be engaging with young men drawn to toxic variants of islam to try and steer them away from it for their good and the good of my culture i think thats necessary with the altright too – we should engage with those young men who are genuinely looking for a path to selfimprovement to try and steer them away from the toxic aspects of altright culture such as white supremacy and misogyny he may not have researched too well but he even gets this one right instead of shaming men like tbp does he actually wants to help those men on the contrary there is tbp which does its best to make sure that more and more people enter trp so they have more satire material
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a white male
PurplePillDebate,removed,idiot lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,just another example of tbp cyber bullies doing what they do and calling it satire people who havent gone full retard will jump in and challenge wtf and they will get downvoted to hell so the bloops can get their jollies
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbp is a part of the feminist mainstream cheating is central to female hypergamy feminism is a philosophy dedicated to expansion of female privilege and elimination of female responsibility what is so hard to understand
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think op is illiterate
PurplePillDebate,removed,replace her with a gravestone preferably
PurplePillDebate,removed,i just have to get this out your username and the grammatical structure of your posts could not be more asian
PurplePillDebate,removed,theyve bought into the media narrative that kia is a hive of misogynist racists despite plenty of proof of multiethnic as well as female membership i suspect most media outlets never bother to do the research
PurplePillDebate,removed,this horse has been flogged to the bone they dont have an alternative thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is no rhyme or reason to a bullys thoughts other than to cause pain for another
PurplePillDebate,removed,blue pill relationship advice is available all around us all you have to do is google relationship advice or go to rrelationships thats what the bp is all about bp basically means the mainstream narrative of society so this information isnt hidden anywhere
PurplePillDebate,removed,i like to read rbadwomensanatomy as an alternative to trp it gets me through my days imo its extremely telling that they have not made any serious attempt at this i think this critique is actually a little overdone the premise is they are unified the only unification property they share is theyre noncerebral to suggest they are unified in any other way is to give them too much credit maybe deep down they know they wouldnt be able to i think thats more to the point no one with leadership potential steps up because theres not unifying opportunity or foundation
PurplePillDebate,removed,why has tbp not gotten their collective heads together and done so one bluepiller explained to me that they had every right to criticise trp without operating alternatives because they were just anti rp they devote all this time and effort and they dont offer a different view other than were a satire sub which would mean no one should take their views seriously and we are anti rp theyre armchair critics they are not willing to offer alternatives because it would mean doing more than hiding behind the satire defense and it risks their position actually being scrutinized far more than it is now should anyone take a bluepiller seriously
PurplePillDebate,removed,the best response i got was basically be hot and set boundaries look as good as you can and have good frame
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must have a sad life
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant generalize all people are special snowflakes everyones so different there are millions of combinations of personal interactions nothing can ever really be known nothing can be predicted human behavior cannot be known or predicted its all just a big crapshoot
PurplePillDebate,removed,this from the woman who doesnt know when a man is sexually interested in her
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok
PurplePillDebate,removed,some of the bp people on here do it actually they have some pretty good advice but its basically the same advice as rp framed in a gentle and polite way and without commenting on womens nature or alt right politics
PurplePillDebate,removed,ohhh ok so you make an unsubstantiated claim and then pretend that youre not sharing the nonexistant knowledge out of spite lmao youre funny bro
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe youre just a moron i mean look at the sheer number of people telling you youre completely wrong in this very thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,its almost like hes determined to try and shame a satire sub it worries me about how obsessed he is with doing this
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont even know how to respond to this to be honest you have successfully convinced me that you are an idiot congratulations
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes wrong and on top of that hes doubling down on his superiority complex on top of his high horse that pussyshit attitude is what pushes men to rp
PurplePillDebate,removed,blue pill guys have a blue pill mens movement promise keepers the good men project they have the veneer of male concern but ultimately are a lot of man up and be the best slave you can be stuff
PurplePillDebate,removed,but what alternatives do you have employ proven sexual strategy without the retarded pop psych buzzwords like hypergamy and awalt in other words go buy robert greenes art of seduction and you never need to go on some bitter subreddit
PurplePillDebate,removed,the blue pill approach is just to go along with popular memes of a gynocentric society

PurplePillDebate,removed,it seems to me like these men must feel disempowered somehow in their own lives so in order to fuel their egos they feel like they need power over women sheer narcissisism they literally want women to worship them for them to need so badly that kind of validation from another human being tells me that they have some profound psychological issues people who are welladjusted secure humans dont require that much power over another human being

PurplePillDebate,removed,less of a share of taxes then men do please explain if i make and you make and were both single live in the same city and have identical deductions im paying the same taxes as you arent i whether or not women should have to pay more for coverage based on usage is a separate issue from whether we as a society want universal health care at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wont respond directly to the question here but i want to point out that this isnt just a matter of past history women in most of the world presentday look for niceguy good provider men that is niceguy in the true sense of the word not the lowsmv groveling type go abroad to anywhere outside of the west and this is the case today even though in most cases their opportunities are now roughly equal to men hell even within the us you can look at nonwhite ethnic groups and thats still largely the case especially amongst and generation immigrants

PurplePillDebate,removed,right because i was the one getting out of line this guy knows hes being a dickhead i just know how to do it right and so i need to step back into my lane nope fuck that dude for being a twat hes not even trying to make this a useful discussion i defended myself for calling him out for being obtuse and so he decides he wants to escalate and guess who studied international politics ill grow my weenie to whatever size he wants
PurplePillDebate,removed,never said everyone is a female but you are clearly a female its annoying that you are pretending you arent and being dishonest about it the carrot dangling in front of them hasnt been enough in recent years men can make enough to have all their needs met while paying almost no taxes if they are just going to live on what they make the last line doesnt make any sense muslims will ensure a controlled smp under sharia law womens rights wont exist at any level
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmaoooooo
PurplePillDebate,removed,what i cant understand this gibberish
PurplePillDebate,removed,the way you talk gives it away
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey feminists why are you championing this woman who raped tortured and murdered a guy and who is entirely unrepentant because paul elam is a dick

PurplePillDebate,removed,some men are still playing by the old books they believe a slow boil is what women want where in reality most women if they find you attractive which they will or wont within one date want to jump your bones
PurplePillDebate,removed,the state is the biggest threat to the prosperity of the individual and it must be dismantled
PurplePillDebate,removed,you speak as if women taking an active role in a relationship is a common occurence
PurplePillDebate,removed,nope itll get stronger unless a higher value man shows up and the woman feels its socially acceptable to swing branches or if the man becomes ugly beta
PurplePillDebate,removed,xd xd xd xd xdddddddddde
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive decided youre illiterate no one in this particular thread is debating that
PurplePillDebate,removed,your original comment was removed because you agreed with me here it is cant argue with this at all women cant enforce any of their rights on their own the state government with its money power brute force and laws that can imprison impoverish and even kill you are the real powers here and in every relationship even every marriage every woman holds the threatpoint like a sword of damocles over her mans head and it is you will do what i say give me what i want and do what i want if you dont ill divorce you and take your money forever leave you penniless and itll take you months or years to get laid again ill call the police and have them arrest you ill press criminal charges against you and have you imprisoned if i can and if i cant get you imprisoned ill jam you up for weeks months or years with the police and the courts and make your life a living hell think i wont do it try me thats what every man instinctively knows now whenever he interacts with a woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,so feminist bpers admit that a strong feminist society never existed because the division of labor never allowed women to be fully involved in politics while they have been bitching since their inception that women were prevented from running a society by the evil patriarchal conspiracy and not by how the division of labor was structured in preindustrial age if i had one dollar for every time feminists contradict themselves id be swimming in a giant vault of coins like uncle scrooge
PurplePillDebate,removed,again that is the very point of this thread let me say it again that is the discussion we are having right now forrest do you understand the premise of the op
PurplePillDebate,removed,says the guy throwing a paranoid tantrum
PurplePillDebate,removed,le intelligent mladies will always have the most refined suitors at her feet the evil mean mladies are not a catch to gentlesirs such as myself sips wine
PurplePillDebate,removed,feel free to not comment then what a fucking tool but i find the floundering of all the bps on this thread to be quite entertaining i assume youre some sort of white knight numale so the answer to this question is simple you want deregulation of the sexual market because it maximally benefits females and disenfranchises males and want a heavilyregulated economic system for the same reasons
PurplePillDebate,removed,uh huh show me pictures of the men chance theyre black
PurplePillDebate,removed,my thoughts how can any average man survive this smp by playing the numbers game improving yourself daily and not giving up how can we compete when the most ugliest low value women have millions of options at their finger tips act like youre competing and keep improving ugly women getting laid is nothing of note we may as well kill ourselves or go transgender if we are in the lucky of men who could pass as female i have seen ugly women plight compared to incels plight but i believe that idea is most laughable if you can pass for female consider going for masculine women theres plenty of people in the world who dont give up in the face of not having it easy if you want to give up on being a man then go for it you will just be one less man for those that have not given up to compete with you reek of pity its disgusting
PurplePillDebate,removed,that sounds like a feminist in male clothing have fun
PurplePillDebate,removed,how can u b so retarded
PurplePillDebate,removed,how is it uncivil to tell a person that they are whining
PurplePillDebate,removed,found the ignoramus whos read about once and thinks he knows the jrpg genre
PurplePillDebate,removed,if it ruined the relationship it means the balance of power wasnt in your favor to begin with your relationship wasnt compatible with your own personal happiness that you sought so if your relationship ends its ok unless you are okay with the lack of power you had in which case why the fuck are you on trp anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,what if i am not having a relationship there is nothing which can be bad for it the majority of our members is not interested in having one at least not with one of you besides you are using the word mindset but what you are looking for is the word facts you are welcome
PurplePillDebate,removed,women are just losing their stranglehold on sexual politics via the spread of knowledge women are just threatened and so they should be they have it way too easy i reckon men of past centuries would be pissing themselves laughing if they got a glimpse into the current state of sexualrelationship affairs theyd be like bahaha you blokes are fucken funny as in too cute
PurplePillDebate,removed,which is not even the same thing but not mutually exclusive this is complete bullshit women did not get educations you say thisand then this upper class women were taught how to read and history which is it please tell me which university exactly that women were even allowed to go to in the middle ages moving the goalposts again pathetic but schools and universities as we know them did not exist and those institutions of higher learning that did exist did not allow women true considering most where religious institutes but the fact is travel was dangerous then so it was easier to have a tutor come to you many merchant families would pay tutors to teach their daughters also back then there was no graduation merely saying youd attended a few semesters at a uni was enough especially peasant women where did i say peasant women tell me could a woman start her own smithing business what a joke and join a guild without being married unfortunately no but she could certainly maintain and grow an inherited business despite what you think bullshit it is true women did not go out on their own to find employment sources plenty of women gained employment working as help or in production before marriage they worked in the capacity to support the family business whatever that may be in deference to their husbands only when married marriage young only happened with the wealthy still waiting for you to tell me which country the woman was the traditional breadwinner and the man stayed home with the kids i notice you didnt quote me that line i already have but see below right what kind of proof do you want like what form should the proof come in would a book on the subject be sufficient did your lazy ass go down to the library like i told you you make a claim you source it the only lazy one here is you no its simply that your examples are irrelevant horseshit i asked for examples where women were the breadwinners and men were the traditional homemakers you respond with ancient fucking warrior women and it was what you wanted i asked for examples where women were the breadwinners and men were the traditional homemakers no you didnt name me a society on earth where the woman doesnt traditionally stay home and care for the household and children thats a bullshit copout even the poor people followed the traditional malefemale dynamics of the time source and as a consequence all universities in the united states are then exempt because all universities in the united states are run with the profit motive even the state schools see thats what happens when you pull bullshit rules out of your ass to get around shit that doesnt fit your narrative it easily gets holes poked in it that you cant address i still have no idea of the kind of point you are trying to make in this incoherent ramble the concept of employment that we have today didnt even exist in the middle ages and you are moving the goalposts because you dont like the answer now suddenly those jobs dont count the fact that you think it did alone tells me you have no friggin idea what youre talking about apparently you havent cracked open enough history books feminist or otherwise history grad here with some focus on the laws of the middle ages you are full of shit were not even debating at this point true im showing you up and youre back pedaling this is more like me reading my mentally challenged cousin a bedtime story the only person coming across as mentally challenged here is you give your cousin your pc heshe at least would debate more honestly than you for future reference if you make claims like you have you are expected to back them up with sources not tell others to google that plus your straw manning and goal post shifting is the essence of bad debate and a clear indicator you have no real historical education
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is completely irrelevant and nonsensical the op clearly proves that the bluepill and feminine imperative myth of incels being too picky is an evil farce the hamstering that women have it worse off because theyre saaaaaaad on the inside is both irrelevant and in bad faith this is like eating your cake and then crying because you cant have it again the next day and the next women love being pumped by chad whether they admit to it or not you all have demented concepts of the male experience tell me one thing when you attack men this way so thoughtlessly and without sympathy do you have any slight introspection at all as to how it makes men feel how we see you and all women who behave this way women should pray to god that men never go extinct or stop white knighting because their thoughtless and heartless judgements will not go unforgotten by the men who remember
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive commented before on a series of links that tbp has compiled and going through it there was a clear case of tbp dishonestly portraying trp as a relationship killer when in pretty much all cases the relationship was on the way out which drove the guy to trp in some cases it was too late but plenty noticed positive outcomes
PurplePillDebate,removed,exactly how would women whos iqs are across the board significantly lower than mens who have no experience with real pain or hardship who live in the gynocentric feminist modern world where their biggest hardship is figuring out how to import enough middle eastern rapists into their countries to fulfill their need for rape exactly how would these creatures know anything about reality of any kind zero intuition zero realworld experience zero reality they think having easy sex whenever they want with hot men and millions of thirsty incels in their own league who would die to commit to them is hardship
PurplePillDebate,removed,on the contrary you are the one who is backpedaling the classic debate methodology of the female

PurplePillDebate,removed,feasible capable of being done or carried out easy not difficult to endure or undergo seem pretty similar to me are you also not moving the goal posts by ignoring my original point and focusing purely on me moving the goal posts
PurplePillDebate,removed,do i give a fuck you tell me id say no but thats why youre bottom thirdtier dating material

PurplePillDebate,removed,httpswwwredditcomrdirtywritingprompts
PurplePillDebate,removed,they do tell woman to be safe so your argument is invalid and not at all thought out just on the news today it told woman to be cautious of running in a certain park in the morning because there have been rapes there lately this is not the first time ive seen news articles warning woman to stay out of certain areas to stay safe of course woman really care what the actual fuck is your problem that you cant go around raping whoever you please you make me fucking sick go back to redpill you actual piece of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh like the redpill posts about woman lol how awful hope youre alright sugar
PurplePillDebate,removed,my life wouldnt change much cuz gender is nothing more than a meaningless socially constructed label anyone can change at will changing it back is as simple as just telling people how you identify if i woke up the opposite sex however and became an actual woman id commit suicide

PurplePillDebate,removed,yes this is false muslims commit little to no terrorism in the us the vast majority of mass shootings are committed by other people but only muslims commit theatrical displays of blatant homophobic killings or you know the vast majority of mass shootings are committed by other people you mean black men roughly of the population and of the violent crime
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont know maybe you should become an incarcerated prisoner so you can find out bonus points insta bad boy cred means youll stop whining on reddit about women ignoring your bland ass
PurplePillDebate,removed,because those criminals are physically hot and thats all that matters when it comes to sex and relationships
PurplePillDebate,removed,becky i wouldnt brag about that im sure you could sit in rchristianity and run your mouth all day but if you had never read the bible people may call you out on being ill informed im holding you to task and to be informed about what you want to debate if you want to call it rollo dick riding thats on you nothing would make me happier than a place to have a sober second through to everything the manosphere comes up with as of now its a sandbox for amused mastery agree and amplify and a general frame check
PurplePillDebate,removed,becky youre right its no where near the law requires you to understand it and has consequences for you not doing so i used to call out my dog for not understanding he cant touch his nose to my televisions sensitive off button but he simply stared at me and wagged his tail now i laugh give him a belly rub hes a good boy but some behavior i cant really fix so i roll with it
PurplePillDebate,removed,becky i like stories my dog loves my unconditionally i would never equate him to a ballsy independent lawyer tough cookie who dont put up with no guff
PurplePillDebate,removed,becky i am a troll you are deadly serious weve both had equal contribution to the debate and the best part this in no way affects your contributions self awareness or understanding of the manosphere i take things seriously when others do right now im officially the only one itt who bothered to read even a handful of one of the rp founders writing soon as i start seeing posts reflective of understanding not even acceptance just understanding ill start to play ball

PurplePillDebate,removed,dont worry if theres more women like you men will start taking pills to eliminate their sexual desires towards women sucks that theres no pills to eliminate your materialistic desires to counterbalance that doesnt it women cause men more pain than pleasure as evidenced by male depression and suicide rates after breakups being higher
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not good because they make promises theyre not gonna keep men are the ones whose suicide rate after breakups is times higher than womens
PurplePillDebate,removed,why do you give a pass for female sexual strategy and hypergamy but get butthurt when men start applying their own sexual strategies
PurplePillDebate,removed,i called you a narcissist not because you gave rp advice but because youre a narcissist and a malicious one at that and you were banned because you broke the subs rules oh and lets not forget how you literally claimed that it was okay for you to break the rules because you dont like the guy i mean come on that aside of course someone whos never been in a relationship can have nah not authority expertise thats your narcissistic brain talking youre probably literally unable to separate authority from expertise and knowledge in fact people who struggle with relationships usually have a much better understanding of them for the average person relationships just happen naturally and they invent whatever explanation for relationships dynamics that makes them comfortable as an unattractive guy who struggled for years to find someone i didnt have that luxury i needed to find what actually works
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you write this without caps

PurplePillDebate,removed,while of male messages go to the top women of all female messages to to the top stop pulling numbers out of your ass women message the most attractive times more often than those at the bottom compared to men who do it times more often also women barely actively message at all so theres that according to okcupid men are times more likely to message than women so their response rates to messages they receive would be more enlightening if you scrolled down you would have seen them however here it looks like women are most likely to respond to men septiles above themselves ie women who are bottom of the barrel septile are most likely to respond to guys who are septile while women who are below average septile are most likely to respond to adonises septile where did you get that from more than of the most attractive women even reply to the least attractive men and less than to the most attractive and the least attractive women reply to the least attractive men more often than the most attractive with

PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,just a note im not going to engage any women on this topic because women throwing in their cents in politics or rather some manufactured opinion they read on vice or cosmo is as laughable as me lecturing a woman how to breast feed a child blue and red pill men are welcome
PurplePillDebate,removed,alright then that settles it out women find jmds character of negan not just offensive but incredibly unattractive everything i thought i knew has been proven wrong golly gee heres a video just taken of me after your amazing and hopeful revelation would you be interested in coming on oprah with me next week to talk about how you rekindled hope in a mean sexist bigots life merry christmas the purple pill

PurplePillDebate,removed,well you would clearly know more about that than a legit real deal professional such as mchugh
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes its been explained many times go feign ignorance for someone else it will work better arent you the poster who is a prostitute
PurplePillDebate,removed,ur a tranny
PurplePillDebate,removed,inserts rick and morty quote about love love is not manly enough for the red pill
PurplePillDebate,removed,jeeez calm down harambe are you experiencing a bout of the vapors
PurplePillDebate,removed,welp as an extreme outlier your opinions arent worth much anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,im just going to say it you and everyone else who seems absolutely baffled by the idea that women would want to be attracted to their partner are indeed a dumbass the amount of trp men whining about that is mindblowing
PurplePillDebate,removed,rick potion in comedy views since jun httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
PurplePillDebate,removed,no they werent because when women say attractive they mean attractive for a bf not sexually attractive no one ever told you being nice was sexually attractive i do not believe you and you cant show me any evidence this is true this is a silly flat out lie its not womens fault some weird little group of men didnt stop to investigate what they meant by attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,congratulations you have done it again another post where you show us how stupid and ignorant you are i really hope that you are a troll because otherwise this is just sad and no it mens height does not matter as much as womans breast size a mans height matters a lot more they are not even comparable the vast majority of women refuse to date short men the vast majority of men could not care less about a womans breast size so no it is absolutely not ridiculous if a short man says that women wont date me because of my height because the vast majority of women do not want to date a short guy a mans height is one of the most important things for a woman and it clearly matters more than a mans personality if you look at how women behave nowadays not to mention the fact the fact that women can get their breast size increased whereas short men cant do anything about their height
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you know how much girlswomen mock zac efron for his height have you not see all the posts on social media of women taking pictures with zac efron and then mocking his height but then again you are using the dumbest of examples a celebrity not only that youre using a celebrity who is also rich and handsome
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have never seen posts like that im sure it is an extremely small minority of women however every picture of a woman with boobs even great ones will have a couple negative comments sprinkled in sometimes people put others down to make themselves feel better but that doesnt mean the in a hundred thousand girls who do that make efron less attractive are you a troll or are you just lying short men are constantly mocked for their height including short male celebrities they get fare more abuse that flatchested women have ever gotten you simply refuse to see this because you are a woman and probably a heightist too which is why you are trying to dismiss the experiences of millions of short men around the world flatchested women are considered infinitely more attractive than short men ever will be there are literally millions of men who would date flatchested women or who simply dont care about breast size you cant say the same about women and short men
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a tiny drop compared to the abuse and discrimination that short men receive your whole comparison is way off its so far off that i cant even believe that anyone would be stupid enough to compare height and breast size
PurplePillDebate,removed,if men arent collectivist then how did political parties and trade unions come about
PurplePillDebate,removed,that is why we have men in holland who are considered short at and women who are considered short at feet tall holy shit d d no we dont stop lying you insecure piece of shit i know native dutch guys half a head shorter then you and no one of them is a pussy like you based on your post history you seem to have extreme issues overall and should consider a good mental clinic which depending on your provincei assume noord or zuid holland should be easy to get into
PurplePillDebate,removed,what would the point for her to dress up and look nice if she didnt get attention for it do you not have the concept of looking good for yourself not everything people do is part of some grand machiavellian scheme to get the most out of other people holy shit people are far more egotistical then you give them credit for lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,well you just have to remember other people are not you its a very helpful way of thought because then you realize that everyone has their own different standards on things and then you get less angry that they are doing things for attention
PurplePillDebate,removed,as the poster says this explains a lot though id have you look into getting some drugs which would help with your psyche
PurplePillDebate,removed,when men originally jumped on board female sexual liberation train they probably figured it would be a mass orgy where everyone would be getting a equal amount of wild crazy sex with strangers every other day of the week they certainly didnt expect the marketplace we have today and they didnt expect women en masse would only flock towards a minority of men leaving everyone else bone dry or getting table scraps
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound mad maybe you should go get a boat and quit being a landloving pussy
PurplePillDebate,removed,if drake or justin beiber wanted a bj you damn well know she would be gagging herself on their dicks without a second thought this is all reverse justification for the man having an extremely low smv
PurplePillDebate,removed,actual studies on this kind of stuff confirm the words of a great sage and philosopher a mans only as old as the woman he feels groucho marx
PurplePillDebate,removed,why is my best something that i hate that hurts dont ask this question your pain is shaming and triggering to him
PurplePillDebate,removed,i still dont see many women coming forward and confessing their unconventional preference in men the patriarchy must be deterring all of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound like a loser
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah but it like a crafts man work its passion
PurplePillDebate,removed,also if you are a man and are not completely totally utterly sure you have the biggest penis your gfwife has ever seen or touched shes failed as a woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol i did respond to your post is it possible for you to drop the sarcasm and condescension
PurplePillDebate,removed,ew
PurplePillDebate,removed,all conversations with women are potential traps
PurplePillDebate,removed,faggots
PurplePillDebate,removed,the special snowflakery is pretty insane with bp women if you believe them theyre literally all attracted to chubby men socially awkward men shy men and so on
PurplePillDebate,removed,its good for tiny dicked dudes thats why usexymcsexington is so into it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i actually agree
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive never thought people needed to be educated on consent its quite obvious when someone is consenting
PurplePillDebate,removed,bbbut nice guys win at the end right right guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,hot men with good jobs and education are womens wet dreams these type of guys are the culmination of all that women long for beta bux and alpha bux all in one guy very few women ever achieve this dream the wives of jon bon jovi pierce brosnan and david beckham are having a better life than any king ever had and not just because they are rich and live in the western world but because they fulfilled womens innate genetic law to find alpha genes
PurplePillDebate,removed,good boys never win
PurplePillDebate,removed,why would anyone object to kids sons and daughters being taught about the law all the times young people were hit with sexual assault charges because they didnt understand what legally was consent and why do we want to doom more kids to this situation
PurplePillDebate,removed,shes not a lesbian
PurplePillDebate,removed,also just throwing this out there but ill teach my son to gather videoaudio evidence whether the female is aware or not best to have all the possible ammunition you can against a false accusation could you possibly be any creepier do you also drive a van with tinted windows seriously wtf
PurplePillDebate,removed,what are you talking about where did i even use the word hypocritical at all did you have a stroke at your keyboard
PurplePillDebate,removed,bitches be emotionally abusive and shit by being fine and refusing to twerk on my dick so what the fuck nigga it all go round
PurplePillDebate,removed,alpha fucksbeta bucks your op didnt mention that once your thoughts move at a thousand miles an hour what random thought are you going to present next
PurplePillDebate,removed,women deserve it
PurplePillDebate,removed,youll never understand i feel sorry for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,they feel belittled by women
PurplePillDebate,removed,i had a similar experience when i first learned of trp i read some of their posts and it seems most of them have been jilted or heartbroken by a woman and as a result have become cruel and dismissive of women after all it is far easier to just declare that the whole gender is dumb and shallow than to actually examine the complexities and nuances of romantic relationships thats just my take based on my observations
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes i remember being on the high school basketball team and in the locker room wed talk about how women are children and how women only travel to ride exotic cock i doubt even a quarter of these terpy fags who say locker room talk have even stepped in a locker room or have even been around men talking not faggy neurotic nerds men
PurplePillDebate,removed,they hate the fact that theyre afraid of women and give them shit tons of power over their lives and selfperception
PurplePillDebate,removed,because it makes them feel a superiority that they cant derive from anything else
PurplePillDebate,removed,they have a couple reasons they have been rejected by women and want to feel powerful not dissimilar to the way a child talks shit about his teacher who just gave him detention it makes it easier to justify treating them badly if all women are dumb whores who just want bbc alpha dick they dont have to treat them with any semblance of respect if women rejected them they either have to reject women or take a look at themselves rather than improve or let the rejection go they have to change their mindset to think that women are somehow wrong example if women all want bbc alpha dick they rejected me because im and they are dumb not because im an asshole no way its their fault all women are just dumb its not me thats the problem
PurplePillDebate,removed,because rp men are the kind of black white thinkers who cant accommodate nuance at all so in order to stop being beta nice guys aka that annoying ugly nerd who is a total doormat bc he thinks being a doormatll entitle him to sexual favours and stop thinking women are wonderful they have to become edge lords who think women are sloooots its really just a symptom of the general mental emotional defects that these men have disclaimer narpalt some of you leave the anger phase etc
PurplePillDebate,removed,if the defense but she had an orgasm is not legit when a women was raped then we cant use it for men in the case i named there was other stuff that made the situation way more traumatic than if it was just the rape if the coercion happens through i am going to slaughter your family then this alone can be traumatic enough or the feeling of helplessness
PurplePillDebate,removed,who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men darkness corrupts ignorance is bliss you seem too innocent and i dont wanna hurt you
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre not as smart as you think you are girl some of us dont care if you have shorter hair glasses or pants or no makeup at all you need a reason to hate trp guys i get it but those things you listed arent a big deal to me and a lot of other red pilled men so youll have to do better than that
PurplePillDebate,removed,you will definitely avoid rp men by going after femboys youll also avoid sex altogether oh you poor sweet innocent child
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really are naive sometimes poor doesnt refer to money at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,yup ive said this before and i think you could incude the manospere as a whole not just mgtow feminists have been shtting on men for decades now with pretty much no opposition calling men obsolete violent rapists and even going as far as to promote political lesbianism no one even cared but now that the manosphere grew in popularity and men are starting to do to women what women have been doing to men for so long all of a sudden people are upset but to bad cuz the manosphere keeps getting bigger and is getting closer and closer to mainstream popularity
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre
PurplePillDebate,removed,no auto mod yet but this my point is that the echo chamber nature of trp encourages a really negative outlook on relationships and women in general i certainly agree that men need to carefully vet their ltr partners and be vigilant to avoid being exploited because it does happen and its not particularly rare but i think its toxic when the discourse is so hyperbolic and onesided that it can damage peoples ability to have otherwise healthy relationships and worldview i agree with i cant change your view however i hope that you stop takong rp so seriously and understand that you are doing pretty well in life you dont have to be a rp stereotype
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok bro you just outed yourself as a virgin girls beg to be spanked and shit my ex gf was a blue blood trust fund slut and she was all nordstomproper during the day but at night we would snort amphetamines and ambien and she would get fucking wild sysy has had sex with at least one sex crazed chick to know that i myself have done some porn under a fake name because of my abs and dick shape so i can say that after fucking girls have loved it rough especially on drugs
PurplePillDebate,removed,theres not automod so i have nowhere else to post this i cant change your view nor am i here to because i agree thinking of the most good looking successful alpha males i know or have known the lifestyle and experiences trp claims are common if not the norm for these men is far from reality the kind of can have any girl he wants anytime chad primarily exists in high school and among the upper echelons of society your musicians wealthy entrepeneurs athletes etc
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you even fucking human how pathetic and empty is your fucking life that you cant find a partner you can enjoy spending time with regardless of sex maybe youre so morally repugnant that women with half a brain avoid you like the plague so you have this delusional idea that theyre all shallow bitches let me tell you a little secret you are the shallow bitch and dont tell me what women think because i can easily think of several women i personally know who abhor cheating would never cheat on their partners and have dumpeddivorced their partner for cheating on them i really only know one woman who thinks and behaves like you think women do and shes just one step short of diagnosable bipolar disorder she even recognizes that about herself so at least she has a bit of the selfawareness that you so obviously lack
PurplePillDebate,removed,manosphere option for weak sensitive men to obtain a more dominant mindset femosphere option for women to obtain a more dominant mindset rpw has a term drunk captain it basically encapsulates all male things that are perceived weaknesses just dump terms like incel bigotry racism into it and forget about them the femosphere and manosphere are both practically identical they are two halves of a coin men and women are different men attempt to be in the top percent and women with society naturally create a weeding out process to remove or use the other percent
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol this is a thing i would just ignore it like men do to women most days
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not a redpiller but i wish that the blue pill people who constantly criticize redpill for being sexist and misogynist would turn their gaze towards shit like this once in a while the femosphere has a long tradition of extreme unbridled hatred towards men and this is rarely if ever talked about by blue pillfeminists i think its made even worse by the fact that many of these people slinging hatred at men are also diehard feminists who claim to support equality
PurplePillDebate,removed,the vast majority of rape sex slavery forced marriage etc through history has been manonwomen therefore women are seen as having a right to bitch back at men femosphere bigotry just doesnt matter to most people
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are you telling the punch line of the joke first its supposed to start knock knock i dont know stupid woman cant even manage a knock knock joke
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao how delusional can you be
PurplePillDebate,removed,sorry but if you think youre being mistaken for an autist because youre high iq you are fucking retarded
PurplePillDebate,removed,of aspergers is pathologizing high iq introverts u r retardo
PurplePillDebate,removed,username checks out
PurplePillDebate,removed,which part of the drivel did i miss
PurplePillDebate,removed,literally all they want to do is to shower you with love and affection and live their life for you and what you want which sounds great on paper but turns out is completely unattractive to me assholes finish first nice guys finish last men should never ever be nice guys get a little asshole in your heart men be selfish and self centered and do shit you want put her after your job your hobbies and the shit you want and need to do trp confirmed
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbp this feels wrong therefore it is wrong
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course thats how it works for a cunt the very definition of solipsism
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must have low t to not get random boners id suggest t therapy talk to your doctor
PurplePillDebate,removed,why do you think its full of crap
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbp is against systemization of people because they find it dehumanizing i would say yep which is hilarious since tbps supposed scientific approach is pretty much all about systemizing people putting them into little groups orly i think you are just projecting here points for effort tho
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must be fun at parties hardly any of the bullshit we discuss here is remotely scientific learn to have some fun its the internet
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre the reason god invented false rape accusations
PurplePillDebate,removed,anyone can be redpill as long as youre a pathetic alpha wannabe feeble minded beta cunt who doesnt understand that the alpha to nonalpha ratio cannot be increased by motherfucking definition you fucken anuses and thinks that treating women like dirt and calling them plates makes you somehow less of a little stupid fucken kid assholes
PurplePillDebate,removed,im calling out a troll and explaining exactly what it is about her posts that indicate why its trolling
PurplePillDebate,removed,your solipsism is so acute you might be a woman pretending to be a man your reply is akin to a white man saying ive never experienced racism so it surely does not exist solipsism so much so that you sound like a woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,opinion which is of a magnitude less than legitimate personal experience nope theyre both the same you felt the need to spew your personal experience as though it mattered or isnt fabricated his opinion is formed from his experience also sherlock he just didnt feel the need to dress up his opinion in the hopes it would become more weighty something you mistakenly believe liars often elaborate when not needed i know youre biased i think youre a woman pretending to be a dude
PurplePillDebate,removed,i report uspacewhiskey for trolling this whole thread as evidence
PurplePillDebate,removed,op you nedd to include more than a link you must have text suffocient to explain it and provide some guidance for the discussion when you have done so reply to my comment and i will reapprove
PurplePillDebate,removed,it wouldnt be a bloody insult if a girl asked you out hah not gonna happen and you say no which you could say for a ton of reasons it isnt an insult the only way it is an insult is if you actually insult her like sending her a rape threat via pm like you did to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,sex initiated by a woman on a man doesnt require his consent and her consent is obvious because shes initiating
PurplePillDebate,removed,his consent is always implicit so its nonsense to talk about it look at the incels on this sub who say theyd rather be raped than be virgins essentially its a decision that hes incapable of making because nature programmed him to be unable to say no
PurplePillDebate,removed,the fact that rp struggles so much to understand consent boggles my fucking mind one thread after another asking the same questions again and again when she says no you respect her and stop oh thats right rp does not respect women well theres your problem
PurplePillDebate,removed,true for me i just come on ppd to see how the other half lives
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol bro that downvote out of nowhere
PurplePillDebate,removed,aka are you stupid enough to not read the op or just stupid enough to assume that i am stupid and would mention these guys as failures rather than successes
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminist everyone is a special snowflake but what about this trans lesbian gender ambiguous sex positive human you cant generalize and make conclusions everyone is different you just have to be a good person you entitled misogynistic asshole
PurplePillDebate,removed,adhd just curious were you on stims when you wrote this
PurplePillDebate,removed,i get that your home is a sex dungeon from which there is no escape without paying in anal but some of us invite friends and family over too
PurplePillDebate,removed,their delusion that alpha males have office jobs with bosses they get really mad if you talk about this one lol when you try telling them that an actual alpha male is the complete opposite of the corporate drone trp teaches you to emulate because such a man would be a tattooed drug dealer they cant even respond they just downvote trp kinda reminds me of american psycho in a way they just tell you to suck up to the corporate dream and act like all the other yes men faking that miserable monotonous existence to hide whats underneath but at least patrick bateman murdered people thats alpha
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure you did coward
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are not worthy of my keyboard effort you feminist
PurplePillDebate,removed,in this thread hide behind weasel words all you want posting point of interest threads to a debate sub because youre afraid to state and defend your position makes you a coward
PurplePillDebate,removed,sips sparkling water agreed though the actual number who probably got successful from the red pill is likely extremely small
PurplePillDebate,removed,your toxic ideas have spread enough
PurplePillDebate,removed,hi op since your post is an affirmative claim it is held to higher standards please develop your post more by doing more than linking to an imgur album please remember that cmv posts require that you genuinely want to participate in having your view changed i am skeptical that you will do so based upon your post
PurplePillDebate,removed,this thread explains everything
PurplePillDebate,removed,where are the personal attacks
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok sensei
PurplePillDebate,removed,just accept what all the bloopers and feminists are telling us over and over and over and the government is telling us by passing all these insane misandric laws they are all telling us that women are not actually adults but more like bigger children the most responsible teenager in the house why fight it accept feminism accept that men are superior to women it all makes sense once you do
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you a lawyer because you realize that you are attempting to step into the legislative realm and interpret law written by lawyers theres a reason people need to go to school to do this kind of work the amateur hour interpretations of red pill users should be recognized for what they are uneducated bullshit this thread is all about understanding consent if you are respectful of women and do not classify no as lmr that needs to be smashed through you will never ever find yourself running afoul of these laws however if you want to focus on uneducated interpretations of existing laws knock yourself out
PurplePillDebate,removed,it really doesnt every pill related subreddit is just a small part of a larger shitpost
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah because the quality of a critical reply to something is dependent not on its content but rather on which website hosts it obviously hey since youre posting on reddit would it be fair to assume that youre a nolife neckbeard and thus dismiss your opinion altogether and carry on discussing ops post
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you want women to have lower standards about sex youre probably an ugly loser who cant turn women on and sucks at sex
PurplePillDebate,removed,glad youre at least acknowledging that dp was acting like a dick and in attack mode
PurplePillDebate,removed,nope that was an answer to your exact question youre being obtuse
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol smh
PurplePillDebate,removed,one hundred percent correct
PurplePillDebate,removed,some peoples experiences and views of womens behaviour on this sub are downright weird and bear absolutely no resemblance to mine probably because youre just a regular well adjusted dude and not some salty trp guy if they actually went outside theyd share a similar view
PurplePillDebate,removed,op is a troll i wouldnt really consider his posts worth anything more than a few laughs
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you autistic or something this is so ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,removed,so basically you were a cuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,trying to play the guilt by association game with me keep dreaming kid also everyone knows im red piled i post red pill opinions on facebook all the time i argue red pill ideas at parties and social occasions whenever they come up and yet nobody condemns me for it i know it must boggle your mind you coming from the neofacist feminist camp where all different opinions must be quashed
PurplePillDebate,removed,depends on your definition ofbetter and women were always pretty equal in the west its the stupid muslims that treat women like dirt
PurplePillDebate,removed,itt the majority of men are just insulting women even their own wives insufferable bitch with a few genuine compliments thrown into the mix i would love to be a submissive and domestic wife but not for someone who calls me a bitch and is weird and rude
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre goddamn right
PurplePillDebate,removed,what about the women reeeeee lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,this post needs to be a cmv due to ops title can you either more strongly challenge what hes saying or repost this to the automod
PurplePillDebate,removed,yep same reason lots of rp newbs get caught up on bashing feminists for their looks rather than their ideology feminists are just as likely as rp men to be lowsmv and crude people love to make fun for no other reason than because it feels good
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats why their arguments always devolve into small dickattractiveness insults virginshaming etc for example this conversation i had a few days ago httpimgurcomawuzjt for what its worth i do have a big dick
PurplePillDebate,removed,bp i will find a way to dismiss this post in words or less i could put in the effort really i could you know but its obvious you didnt post this to debate very one sided tbp troll blue pillers ha ive controlcopied shit from stones post to come to intentional erroneous tldrs so others dont have to do the work either lolzwhere is my artesian carbonated water so that i may sip whilst i mock
PurplePillDebate,removed,i thought it was for letting out your misogyny
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you get off of it does it improve how you socialize or are you just a shitposter with plenty of time what great insights have you learned from being an idiot
PurplePillDebate,removed,abuse
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh shut the fuck up you pathetic loser get a life
PurplePillDebate,removed,looks like were done here careful not to get sand in your ears lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,go get raped and murdered you ugly cunt there you go op try to arrest me now whatre ya gonna do ugly cunt lose some weight shave your legs stop being an ugly cunt and then maybe youll be able to finally live out your rape fantasy which you feminists sexually obsess over so much
PurplePillDebate,removed,special snowflake right here i wonder what trp would have to say about you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah and you probably have no religion so you have no right to lecture me about mine
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are the congrats
PurplePillDebate,removed,youve never met me but i can assure you that awalt doesnt apply to me proof lol woman logic
PurplePillDebate,removed,you know nothing about me but thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think youre particularly stupid based on the fact that youve taken to spamming my inbox which is saying a lot for this sub
PurplePillDebate,removed,researchers first observed that male chimps make up more easily than female chimps blacks arent necessarily representative of the population at large
PurplePillDebate,removed,but i wanna haves period pain tooo
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a special snowflake attention seeker im sorry to say this beb but from what youve just typed up youre not much different to the majority of women we know do you really think other women dont think in the way you do or are you just better than all of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is wiab youre talking about everything short of a life sentence for people who behave in a manner deemed problematic by feminists probably isnt enough
PurplePillDebate,removed,op i havnt even read it because we all know you arent stable pls stop
PurplePillDebate,removed,presuming that female sexual strategy is pragmatic why the hell would an attractive woman settle for a boyfriend she is not attracted to because relationship suitability starts and stops at sexual attraction right jackass because there has never existed a male and female couple where the man appears mismatched right because people have qualities which start and stop at their looks right because no woman has ever dated an ugly man of wealthsignificant social status god this isnt even about stupidity its quite clear that like most on this forum you likely possess little to no sexualrelationship experience and struggle with dating like the rest of the cretins on these blue pillpurple pillred pill forums presuming a woman makes a man wait because she is not attracted to him why does she eventually have sex with him usually very frequently if she was not attracted to him surely she would put it off indefinitely yes because sexual desire is not fluid and cannot be influenced by anything other than a mans looks a woman has never ever taken a dick because that dick is attached to a man who despite being uglyphysically unappealing is richfunnyfamousstrategically advantageousattractively aggressive i mean christ the only people who say looks are the only thing women consider are the loser virgins on messageboards are you the female version familiarity and time can be considerable factors when it comes to stimulating sexual desire you have a poor grasp of your own thoughts and reasoning probably because youre some immature millenial no you didnt say women cant have nsa sex but when you frame women as these beings who are easily compromised by casual sexual liaisons youre heavily implying that they cant only an idiot cant see that they never said sexual engagement is harmful to women and then say in the very same fucking comment no less its about the womans selfpreservation its a woman shielding herself until theres enough security self preservation from what what could said self preservation be relating to other than the obvious attempt at implying that sex can be harmful to women it is outdated unless were talking about explicitly criminal acts there is no self preservation required for women who give away sex unless youre trying to imply that women will increas emotional attachement to those they sleep with and please dont try and deny this it obvious thats what youre trying to say sorry but that argument only comes from the naive and sexually inexperienced the loss of a sexual partner is not traumatic to every and any woman lol this post makes it abundantly clear you have no idea what youre talking about and likely have little to no sexual experience either
PurplePillDebate,removed,this seems more cultural than biological to me found the guy who probably needs trt
PurplePillDebate,removed,arent we talking about the rp guys and their belief that a woman who doesnt work will steal your money when you divorces because she cant provide for herself this is paranoia imo a lot of divorce settlements are structured in a way where if a partner sacrificed professional development allowing the other to develop that part of themselves they receive compensation for that regarding your last sentence youre saying that a woman who is independent and is a stem entrepreneur like me cant come and talk to you on this board because that would be bragging who defines who has the right to participate on this board you if youre going to be a sarcastic child i will just say yes and youre banned from the board in all honesty if someone asks you what you do obviously its nice to be able to tell them something admirable but bragging about how you dont need no man fo money is something chavs in instagram do it had no relevance to the discussion since trp is critical of the independent woman circlejerk
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol so naturally rp men your logic so amusing
PurplePillDebate,removed,i guess shes bathing in her own tears now
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey wombat feeling cranky after your little mental breakdown on femradebates ive never seen someone get blown out so hard and still be unable to admit theyre wrong damn you crazy feminist types are entertaining
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,coming from someone too vapid to call herself something other than an asian female youre really only valuable for your cunt
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol nevermind dont want to hurt that brain of yours two logical steps to make i know i know its asking a lot
PurplePillDebate,removed,another horrible comment by you constantly surpassing yourself i see congrats
PurplePillDebate,removed,argument
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,dindu nuffin all over this thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,no sweets thats your hamster talking
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey buddy can you take my other comment and point out exactly where i used the word many nowhere exactly i wasnt talking about sluts or virgins or commitment i was talking about people finding other people attractive could you stay on topic or did you also have a brain aneurysm should i call another ambulance
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont get to pick the topics buddy actually i do stay on topic or kiss my gorgeous ass nice downvoting by the way thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,have fun getting non answers
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats basically trp in a nutshell man good woman worthless
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol i easily won the debate brah
PurplePillDebate,removed,yet again avoiding marriage entirely is the best play i wonder how long before the vast majority of the world figures out this simple to understand concept
PurplePillDebate,removed,come on all feminists are denying they are feminists these days lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,spin plates mgtow or find a unicorn and below percentile man these are your only options assign educated probabilities for each scenario and choose wisely
PurplePillDebate,removed,listen dude stop with your black and white aspie thinking nice aspie shaming besides the whole point of binary views in discussions is to simply and provide brevity if we considered every possible nuance a few paragraphs of discussion suddenly turns into mountains upon mountains of essays that is not very conducive to a discussion forum
PurplePillDebate,removed,sounded pretty feminist to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,parameter is specifically there to force blue pill hamstering to find the exception to the rule
PurplePillDebate,removed,i just quoted your post and youre asking me lol blow me i just answered you in the other post anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,already have we will see what happens
PurplePillDebate,removed,no
PurplePillDebate,removed,so basically he is insecure and letting you know he thinks other men are more attractive to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,pack it up folks upvote for you good sir
PurplePillDebate,removed,nope
PurplePillDebate,removed,my point was pretty well summarized in the last line of my post if your attention span is so short you didnt get that far not my problem if youre feigning ignorance stop it its unbecoming
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats explained in the book
PurplePillDebate,removed,whilst i understand that you are probably drunk please tell me you know what confirmation bias is confirmation bias is the tendency to search for interpret favor and recall information in a way that confirms ones preexisting beliefs or hypotheses while giving disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh jfc for those who read everything literally and are incapable of abstract thought let me interpret women hope men will change into the kind of men they really wish them to change into they hope that they become their ideal man after marriage but they dont the whole observation is about idealism and expectations not the literal process of people changing or remaining static over time am i dealing with a bunch of spergs in this thread or what this is just getting frustrating as hell
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe you should wait to make posts and have discussions until youre actually capable of having them then threads like this wont happen
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must be doing pretty well if this is what gets you riled up
PurplePillDebate,removed,okay sweetie those are some nice thoughts you have ps women slut shame too you need a better understanding of the legal system
PurplePillDebate,removed,didnt you hear having sex with people other than me is unfair now
PurplePillDebate,removed,lets give upembayliss a break here hes busy posting on ppd all day im afraid hell get burnt out if we start demanding for actual citations and examples
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbp guys arent all pussy slayers lmao
PurplePillDebate,removed,sounds like your ex was just a cunt mate
PurplePillDebate,removed,its just a reiteration of the classic marxistfeminist charge that women who reject feminism are suffering from false consciousness just dont know what they want and need to have their consciousnesses raised
PurplePillDebate,removed,many women agree with trp concepts and theory but in indirect subtle ways for example most girls in college will probably agree that the athlete guys on the soccer or football team are way more attractive than the guys who are just physics or cs majors alpha vs beta more specifically girls would probably agree that muscular confident guys are more appealing for casual sex than just smart nerds
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one no one gives a shit about you as a man in society if you dont prove yourself as a man and provide
PurplePillDebate,removed,found the outlier
PurplePillDebate,removed,no using your analogy the red pillers are the guys who try to act like jocks to become popular but its obvious that theyre not really jocks and end up looking like posers when people see through the charade they get angry and start hating everyone else for making the jocks popular they still dedicate of their time towards becoming popular while at the same time denouncing popular people as evil instead of finding healthy ways to make friends they decide to try to become more popular by manipulating people blue pillers are almost everyone else the nerds the jocks the cheerleaders the preps the goths and the gamers who criticize the red pillers for their hypocrisy
PurplePillDebate,removed,wtf
PurplePillDebate,removed,why you getting so worked up over bluepillers opinions you took the cheese hook line and sinker
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont see the conection no and im very worried about your aluminum foil fedora
PurplePillDebate,removed,well duh
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,okay elliot rodger
PurplePillDebate,removed,no that would not be a productive use of your holes
PurplePillDebate,removed,theeeraaaaapyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop being average then
PurplePillDebate,removed,have you ever discriminated against a woman because she was a woman have you been violent or abusive towards a woman solely because of their gender do you treat the women around you worse solely because they are women regardless of their actions if you dislike a woman do you do so because of what they do or the way they act or because of their gender would you dislike or treat badly a man who acted the same way if you have done none of these things you are not a misogynist it doesnt matter what you think or how you are on the inside its your actions that count if you dont treat women badly simply because they are women then you are not a misogynist if you treat people badly because of their actions and those people happen to be women you are still not a misogynist women have agency and are responsible for their choicesactions so giving a woman a free pass for actions that would warrant a different reaction of the culprit had been a male actually makes you a misandrist for you are treating the male worse than the woman for the same choicesactions purely on the basis of his gender
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes if you have the slightest ounce of prejudice or assumption towards the opposite sex that cause you to in any way shape or form treat them differently than you would a man you are a misogynist s strawman aside and not using some powertalkinfused politicallycharged feminazi definition you are a misogynist only if the traits you ascribe to women cause you to hate them if you still love them youre just a boring sexist like everyone on planet earth however bpers have a good argument here if you define female traits as that which tend to revolve around everything destructive for human civilization which even if they dont create a misogynist are easily misogynistic believing that women are all deceitful naturally cunning but shortsighted succubi hellbent on the extraction of labor from men and then turning around like a proud warrior towards his alpha bros to say nah i love women because evil keeps men vigilant this still makes you a misogynist
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre anything but a misogynist you know your role and accept it by the sound of it you pose little threat and therefore you dont make them wetscared no youre just a classic pill guy that is not noticed but one day when youre youll land some moderately overweight divorced woman and think the pill has served you well your life is already written nature made women to be much more selective that i can agree on women are fucking pros at judging what a guy has or is its pretty amazing actually the majority of women are pretty fucking accurate this is evolution in the modern day
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think hes being unreasonable i think you are he asked if the feminist diatribes encompass even one as rational as him in this you are too cowardly to admit indeed they do
PurplePillDebate,removed,lift
PurplePillDebate,removed,look at this psychotic bitch xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,lifting is the way fuck receiving appropriate medical help man just lift your autism away
PurplePillDebate,removed,damn what a bunch of assholes quick bloopies better go upvote that guy to cover up their blatantly obvious feminist pandering proving oncemore that no matter how much they deny it theyre all a bunch of rad fem sarkeesian supporters with superiority complexes
PurplePillDebate,removed,prostitution is likewise an absurd response as its broadly illegal in the west yeah youre so alpha and amoral that you gotta make sure you respect the law at all times haha what a joke
PurplePillDebate,removed,didnt you know that if girls dont like you it is because youre an evil misogynist serial killer women who date men who constantly act like bullies to others have no way of knowing that the asshole will turn on her as well its not like theres a track record of behavior or anything
PurplePillDebate,removed,incels are evil and should be sent to concentration camps because womens rejection is conclusive proof that they are satandevilluciferadolfhitlers it is not like an incel in america could win the lottery and suddenly bitches would be on his dick or anything it isnt like he could fly over to thailand and year old hotties would be loving him or loving his bankroll because everyone knows that womens selection of men is based on pure unchangeable logic rather than flakey whims and sheep herd baaaaaa social pressure
PurplePillDebate,removed,au contraire mon frere women see the bully bullying others and their pussy gets wet this big bad bully can protect me they think but when the asshole bullies them as well theyre shocked and surprised
PurplePillDebate,removed,shhhhh let him project
PurplePillDebate,removed,dude youre selfadmitted clueless and lucked upon your success try not to have too strong an opinion
PurplePillDebate,removed,relax your secret is safe with me
PurplePillDebate,removed,people have the right to judge whoever they want im glad youve established yourself as just an asshole you want to voice controversial opinions be prepared people are going to challenge you since when did men being attracted to younger better women become controversial its just like women being attracted to dominant assholish typa dudes its not controversial well maybe in your head it is but really its just basic most common behavioral patterns in heterosexual people
PurplePillDebate,removed,did i hit a soft spot
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok sweetheart act like a man ill talk to you like one
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why you cant get laid what a pathetic anc defeatist attitude
PurplePillDebate,removed,no point in trying to discuss anything with them theyre feminists and will harbor no discussion
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,needs more shaming language to put this cis white scum in his place maybe copy this thread to tbp and get a downvote train happening that teach him for having a preference hate to think what size lynch mob would invade ppd if he admitted no fat chicks
PurplePillDebate,removed,no there is a correlation between being overweight and self control and there are tons of correlations between success in the smp and being fat slavery still exists all over the world in fact i can and do argue that it exists right here in america right now people just refuse to talk about it anyway good luck with your insane quest to psychologically torture and emotionally abuse everyone into compliance with your insane hateful ideology dont worry your side has been and will continue to lose because its based on envy and denial of reality meanwhile our side will continue to grow and win because its based on truth of course id welcome you to join us and accept reality nobody likes the truth its harsh but at some point youve got to get over the anger and accept it
PurplePillDebate,removed,shes not just one woman she is hillary rodham clinton she who will not be denied she is queen of the universe oh wait
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sorry youre getting downvoted but youre absolutely right maybe i saw it before the minions realized it made them look bad and they started to upvote it instead
PurplePillDebate,removed,fantastic and well written piece op omit the bit about women also being oppressed they are not in the west they are a privileged majority and this would go down well in trp
PurplePillDebate,removed,most men work in an office theres a lot of blue collar jobs and working class men are a sizeable minority of employed men much more so than your dumblrina figure of but even for middle class men working in offices theres no generalized privilege over women my father worked in an office he worked hours everyday plus hours of commuting he had to endure so much more responsibilities compared to my mother who worked parttime work is not just money and power its also stress sacrifices and responsibilities the equivalence work privilege is far from being true
PurplePillDebate,removed,cisness helicopterness
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists that is all
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is somewhat related to a question i posted in rforeveralone just yesterday
PurplePillDebate,removed,id encourage her to cheat on you just to piss you off lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah i dont get it either praising how great she is in one comment and then talking about how shes basically a boring lay not worth remaining faithful to in the other all men are not like that its just a lack of tact or integrity wrapped up in a silly excuse repulsive
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol thathappened
PurplePillDebate,removed,but these girls are the attractive ones all the attractive girls are like this no they arent you just dont have the ability to get the high quality attractive girls who are normal and arent crazy because they dont like you they boycott people like you d
PurplePillDebate,removed,not all women will give birth
PurplePillDebate,removed,western princesses and their troublesome lives mate d
PurplePillDebate,removed,did you copy and paste a prepared set of platitudes for the keywords being nice because you comment is tangential at best to my question
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminist ideology is very comfortable with telling facts to die in a fire have proof that using brutal violence enhances your smv feminists are happy to brand you a liar without doing anything distasteful like looking at the evidence first
PurplePillDebate,removed,all of this is mostly what every human knows in a natural way it would be if we lived in a natural world but we dont there are legitimate problems in our society the decrease of testosterone levels the emasculation of men the massive disrespect of men by the feminism and people becoming less social than before all of this combined created a fresh phenomenon of socially inept unattractive sexless males and the only way to solve this problem is by making the men masculine again and abandoning feminism as a hate movement against men and masculinity i dont think it is possible to come back to the fifties but the current situation is not acceptable either trp essentially is just one way for a modern man to increase his masculinity lift approach go out activate your inner normal man
PurplePillDebate,removed,as with any study where sexual experience is selfreported theres a significant risk of respondents lyingexaggeratingmisremembering while i can believe the conclusions the survey is reporting it could simply be that theyre isolating groups that are more likely to exaggerate their experience not groups that actually have had more experience people who arent in gangshavent used a weapon in a fightdont drink frequently are likely more comfortable admitting sexual inexperience than people who live in highly masculine environments that would lead them to respond differently to those questions
PurplePillDebate,removed,every human being is striving for genetic perfection with women being the gatekeepers of sex and reproduction they arent going to let subpar genes get into the next generation as it should be you are forgetting that natural selection exists in nature some men that are incompatible with the environment such as too tall and thus need too much food or are too dumb and thus cant hunt would have died out the surviving males would then compete for the females and some would reproduce sexual selection alone is not selecting for any kind of genes even controlled natural sexual selection can produce quite peculiar results in fact such as huge gorilla males detrimental big red baboon asses detrimental colorful detrimental peacock tales developed treelike deer horns detrimental and more you are naive to think uncontrolled sexual selection in humans will select for anything perfect
PurplePillDebate,removed,at least my relationships where i wasnt the dumper didnt fail due to conceited sardonic passive aggressivism
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh can we just do one with this niceness and sexual attraction obsession tell me guys you ever get an erection because an ugly or fat chick handed you a slice of cake or gave you a lift to work or whatever nice thing that isnt a blowjob or anal
PurplePillDebate,removed,women want the alpha male but he needs to survive first and he heeds to have the proper set of genes for his environment first natural selection and sexual selection are two different things how did asian people evolve to be so short the answer is that they lived in a harsh environment do we have natural selection now not really life is too easy we are not animals anymore do we have sexual selection now yes we do what do you think will happen when a runaway selection process is left unchecked
PurplePillDebate,removed,women arent as visual as men why do you say that do you ever see a male body used to advertise something for women we always see beautiful women on tradeshows and sports events for men but we dont see that on similar events for women even when directly asked women clearly say they want confidence why do you think women put on high heels and stockings and makeup to look sexy while men buy expensive cars and private jets why do you think a suit is still the goto attire of an attractive male you clearly have no idea if you think women are as visual or more visual as men women are attracted to how they feel not to what they see women feel good when a big strong intimidating male says right things to them men feel good when they see a nice ass and hips height is important too but you can compensate for it it will be harder but what can you do in fact id go as far as to say that the very fact that youre so obsessed with your image shows how emasculated you are real alphas dont give a flying fuck about how they look because being an is about dominance its about strength its about fighting other males masculine looks is just a byproduct of having high testosterone
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont even understand what alpha is as i said alpha is about fighting other males and establishing hierarchy a bitchfaced cutie emasculated prick would get his face punched in by a proper alpha male and that proper alpha male would impregnate the female the rest is just a consequence a large body is a consequence high status and wealth is a consequence confidence no fear of repercussions is a confidence id wager even a short masculine guy would be more successful than a tall twigboy bitch
PurplePillDebate,removed,men just need a fight club
PurplePillDebate,removed,clubs are full of sluts tho
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are correct
PurplePillDebate,removed,the point is not that niceness should get you laid the point actually is that niceness is detrimental to getting laid and you cant use susan boyle anyway because she is a woman and female attraction is different than male attraction so apples vs oranges you in fact are agreeing with op the op is that attractive people are attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,true true but i want a unicorn
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not really that apples to oranges it is i dont typically see men fawning over the unattractive girl whos nice men are visual
PurplePillDebate,removed,double negative women are not visual tho
PurplePillDebate,removed,fucking is useless tho marrying a unicorn is the only way
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah theres a reason none of lollygagyos egalitarian mutual respect path relationships worked out but hey some people can hamster that away no matter how many times it happens
PurplePillDebate,removed,women are not visual is my point
PurplePillDebate,removed,women told me that and i myself confirmed that multiple times are you a woman why do you think youre visual
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think women being visual is a feminist myth of course as fellow humans women are no doubt visual to some degree though not as much as men are is what i think furthermore i think even though women do find the typical sexsymbol males attractive they evaluate attraction differently in real life scenarios i think the phenomenon of attractive male celebrities is to some degree preselection basically when an attractive male is portrayed as highstatus successful dominant and lusted after in the media preselection makes women in real life lust after as if that status was real im actually genuinely curious on this topic on one hand there are loads of women in the askreddit thread saying that what you wear doesnt matter as long as it fits on the other hand there are feminists like yourself and the other poster saying that women are visual finally there is real life where women obsess over their image and men obsess over their status hot bodies stockings high heels makeup and showing body on one side wearing suits watches driving expensive cars and owning private jets on the other i guess the real question should be is a woman being a gold digger by prefering status or is she genuinely attracted to it
PurplePillDebate,removed,costbenefit analysis
PurplePillDebate,removed,how much do you think looks matter
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a time wasted that could be spent playing videogames spinning plates is pointless to each their own i guess
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe ill try it someday though it kinda seems unfulfilling
PurplePillDebate,removed,being an arrogant asshole doesnt make your argument any stronger it makes it much much weaker in fact
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure
PurplePillDebate,removed,looks is the only thing she can evaluate over the internet so i dont think it means anything
PurplePillDebate,removed,well the fact that she requested the picture in the first place kinda implied that
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok after reading that i have zero interest in talking with you feminist girls care more about civilization than you do hell i really think i like feminists because they at least care good luck with your shit nineteen year old girl im sure you have it all figured out
PurplePillDebate,removed,gut feel
PurplePillDebate,removed,meh
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol parched vagina
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sure sound bitter
PurplePillDebate,removed,what does striking a nerve have anything to do with it i just pointed out the absurdity of your claim i flipped your argument you used it as an example of white privilege now be a good sjw and explain your reasoning
PurplePillDebate,removed,just look at posts by the red pill right now in ppd if women get drunk at parties or wear tight clothing they are apparently asking for it and should change their behaviour they arent saying that the women are asking to be raped they are saying that intoxication to the point of incapacitation in an unsafe setting is unwise which it is feminists are also the ones trying to get definitions of rape changed so that rape is not just about penetration so that a man can have a woman charged with rape thanks for the legitimate reason for me to support feminism others are just insisting that im blind to reality our history books are full of what men did and said women were barely allowed to be the scientists artists writers explorers managers decision makers etc of the past and all we were were nameless baby machines were do you have any idea what it feels like as a woman to read history it feels like my own gender wasnt even part of it seems like men with spines kept women out of the picture all along more like men without spines who were afraid of women you think i read history and feel like a part of it because those in it shared my gender personally i hate history and assert that i had nothing to do with it men who are afraid of women and who are desperately trying to hang onto power i never had a reason to fear women until one threatened to kick my ass and a dude locked me up before i could finish laughing im still not afraid that guy was a pussy like all feminist men and what power is it that you think im trying to hang on to name one
PurplePillDebate,removed,you can dress it up as being noble and helping the needy all you like they are not refugees but economic migrants who are acting as an invasion force western women love this because their own men are so brow beaten and pussy whipped by feminism do you honestly think that muslims will assimilate to western society and believe in womens rights what a laughable concept that could only come from an ignorant marxist who thinks all religions are the same ishaq as for ali he said women are plentiful and you can easily change one for another altirmidhi when allahs messenger was asked which woman was best he replied the one who pleases her husband when he looks at her obeys him when he gives a command and does not go against his wishes regarding her person or property by doing anything of which he disapproves tabari vol number treat women well for they are domestic animals with you and do not possess anything for themselves from muhammads farewell sermon the prophet said i looked at paradise and found poor people forming the majority of its inhabitants and i looked at hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women the prophet said isnt the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man the women said yes he said this is because of the deficiency of a womans mind sahih bukhari the prophet said the stipulations most entitled to be abided by are those with which you are given the right to enjoy the womens private parts ie the stipulations of the marriage contract quran court testimony and call to witness from among your men two witnesses and if two men be not found then a man and two women quran inheritance the male shall have the equal of the portion of two females quran and the men are a degree above them
PurplePillDebate,removed,enlighten me its like a dance with a leader and follower i dont understand because you clearly dont as you probably know the term awalt is a response to the claim that not all women are like that virtue signaling that women use against trp trp is not trying to attract some subset of women it works on all women this constant attempt to reframe is very weak it simply states that trp men are bad hunters who only go after weak prey and virtue signals that it would never work on a strong independent woman like me it would and it does because women across the globe react to the same things in fact the more dominant a woman is the more dominant a man must be in order to elicit a favorable response its the same as a woman who wears very high heels needing a much taller man compared to if she simply did not wear the heels because the need to feel protected is ingrained blanket statements are valid all women should take precautions but feminism teaches them that personal responsibility is not necessary youre pretty sexist so is nature suck it commie
PurplePillDebate,removed,mental disorder
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant just force a woman to see masculine perspective
PurplePillDebate,removed,i had a muslim bro a while back who would get irrationally angry at women at random times wed be just walking along and his face would cloud over and hed stop talking except in grunts and then eventually burst out with now why would a woman dress that way doesnt she realize there are children around why do the women in this country dress like prostitutes i would carefully painstakingly egg him on just enough prodding to keep the coals blazing youre right amir its really disgusting im sure in a country where shit made sense you could just pull up that tramp by the hair and teach her a lesson too bad things dont work that way here but between you and me if i was a cop id give the man who beat some sense into that whore a pat on the back we lost touch a few years back because he went to prison for hospitalizing his thengirlfriend i was pretty shocked and crushed when it happened i had been hoping he would pull an er
PurplePillDebate,removed,they havent been engaging in good faith ever theyre not here to debate us theyre here to shame us into conceding
PurplePillDebate,removed,pussypass
PurplePillDebate,removed,no they are just dumb people that dont understand its impossible for two societies to live together without clashing the muslims will never be assimilated by the western world and what will happen as its happening already is that all of those young middleeastern men are going to rape and hurt women now is the time for women to start lifting weights and to learn martial arts because i sure as shit aint going to risk my life if the muslims ever take a foothold inside the usa lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,bluepill has no dignity and doesnt want anybody else to have any either
PurplePillDebate,removed,and folks this is really what what feminists want men to be further exploited in the name is equality they want to be equal yet still get special privileges aka pussypass and not be held to the same standards as men draft being responsible for your safety etc most would sink into deep dark pits of depression if they were truly treated equal in the same way most men are treated by society and women at large lady you are a nutcase
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck no we are grown ups ffs and i would say the same thing to the whining thread about how women are obligated to do anything for a guy offering to buy them a drink totally ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course if hes sure just as with the drink example if they are just getting to know one another to see if they are interested in each other either as romantic partners in some way as with drinks or as a potential ltr sex thats a different story knowingly leading someone on whom you are certain you dont want is wrong whether it involves exploiting the knowledge that someone wants sex or a ltr if on the other hand she accepts the drink and is open to meeting him as a potential romantic partner and ends up deciding no she did nothing wrong similarly if they start dating and early on have sex and a little bit later on down the road he decides shes not the ltr for him and he cuts it off he did nothing wrong their intentions werent to use the other in those scenarios
PurplePillDebate,removed,he absolutely ought to but he shouldnt be obligated to frankly i think you can have much better shortterm casual relationships with a clear conscience if youre upfront about it even then girls will still want to lock guys down but at least they were warned
PurplePillDebate,removed,depends on the context in my opinion if you meet at a party and have a drunken fuck or you meet on tinder dont put a ton of time in and sleep together early shit like that then no if youve been on multiple dates before having sex or met through your social circle then i think its both smart and the right thing to do to clarify that
PurplePillDebate,removed,its almost like alchohol has been used as a social lubricant for most of human history or something god damn youre beta as they come
PurplePillDebate,removed,xd this is so creepy
PurplePillDebate,removed,gray short hair thickframed glasses tattoos and piercings youre going for that im offended by everything look arent you its very common where im from one of the liberalfeminists meccas in the us
PurplePillDebate,removed,they dont see it as an insult they see it for what it is a desperate ugly womans attempt to get attentionany attention both positive and negative
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont forget ive read a lot of your posts you are pretty much one of the perpetually offended virtue signalers on ppd
PurplePillDebate,removed,he shouldnt say ill call you if he has no intention of doing so he doesnt have to say directly im not interested in ltr if she doesnt ask if she asks then he should tell the truth but he shouldnt act as if he wants a ltr if he doesnt
PurplePillDebate,removed,obviously unhappy women should cut a piece off their left hand index finger
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have a hard time taking anything from europe seriously after they let all the sand people come in
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh get over it you asked for evidence got a fuck load and you still refuse to see any merit in it youre obviously just stuck in a pile of your own bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,shhh quiet you dont disrupt her rationalizations with little things like facts
PurplePillDebate,removed,like your posts you like my posts bless you
PurplePillDebate,removed,your flair and comments are amazing its amazing what people are doing with poes law in been keeping an eye out on your comments for a bit and im still not sure if youre sincerely a twerp or making fun of them by playing a caricature of them i dont really care which it is the entertainment value of your account will remain the same just wanted to let you know its appreciated
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,gets popcorn
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you felt that men could have as much flexibility in their gender role as women can without being rendered unfuckable oh thats just their solipsism i personally wouldnt fuck some guy that doesnt have strong sweaty muscles therefore effeminate guys cant ever get laid id bet a dollar that even gets more sex with relatively good looking women than the top percentile trpers even though they claim that awalt is not to be taken literally they do take it literally by believing that a could never get laid if they get called out in it its just a heuristic but when it comes to making logical conclusions all women are a single entity and if they admit that he could get laid they brush it off by saying that he only gets which no man would ever want and here again they dont believe that different people could have different taste and dont understand that just because they personally wouldnt want an alternative chick that this doesnt mean that no man could want it
PurplePillDebate,removed,upornaddict make a small edit to your post so that the automoderator notices it and posts the message for the offtopic section of the thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,when you examine feminist beliefs they are literally all either obvious to all sane people qualified people should not be discriminated against for their sex or simple gibberish the usa is something that can fairly be labeled a patriarchy nobody can understand gibberish as by definition it lacks any meaning its like saying i cant do math because i cannot divide seven by zero
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont forget that the destruction of marriage has also made womens commitment worth far less thereby giving their short term sexuality a higher weight
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you so say so i do think that genuine kindness is a necessary trait for someone to be a good person and i think you need to be a good person to have good relationships im sorry if not meeting my standards of decency hurts your feelings please rest assured that hurting your feelings wasnt my goal when i came up with my values system
PurplePillDebate,removed,just stating the fact not virtue signaling lolol to reiterate looks is the only thing that matters in a womans smv my little friend does not care whether you have a college degree or how much you make all that matters is how fertile and healthy you look which sadly for you excludes fat women
PurplePillDebate,removed,lets play the how bad is your post game from the sidebar no affirmative claims in titles feminists are trying to shame men into finding undesirable women attractive no excessively leading questions i mean its a very leading rant but there is no actual question posed no editorialized titles nothing but an editorialized title no links to outside content without posttext sufficient to explain the linked content no rants nothing but a rant no witchhunting hey you didnt break this one no questions internal to trp or tbp again no question at all posts should be in good faith lol no theres no good faith in a rant that jokes about fat women caking on their makeup posts from brand new accounts with no karma may be removed at the mod teams discretion weeks old but you focus on upvoteheavy subs so at least you have the karma posts from accounts with negative karma are not allowed see do not post compulsively see know our flair system nope no flair cmv posts are moderated differently see here for info id bet gold op didnt check the info there so your post only overtly broke of the rules but a is still an f in most places
PurplePillDebate,removed,rolls eyes boo hoo we average men cant date attractive women so now we have to sit at home and cry and jack ourselves off fuck you feminism wahhhhh
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is a dogshit post and even shittier hypothesis that demonstrates pretty conclusively how ignorant and misguided red pill is when it come to economics first of all there are no stats to back up this argument one shitty chart that demonstrates a very tenuous and unfounded historical correlation correlation is not causation secondly there are no reputable sources presented if you are trying to make an economics argument sources are extremely important ms magazine cannot be taken seriously do your fucking research or go back to fantasizing about chads big cock third this premise is so stupid and easily debunked that it has been featured on rbadeconomics because the only way to respond to this shit is with straight up anyone who takes this stuff seriously is outing themselves as being absolutely ignorant of modern economics in short if you believe this you look like a fool for those interested in a serious discussion of the actual causes of wage stagnation this is a topic with much academic research and inquiry that is all httpwwwepiorgpublicationcausesofwagestagnation httpswwwbrookingseduopinionssourcesofrealwagestagnation too there is no reason for red pill guys to keep making these ridiculous arguments stop looking like idiots i know there are smart rpers i have talked to them you guys need to work to this shit from your ranks it makes you all look like you ride the short bus
PurplePillDebate,removed,so doubling the workforce doesnt dilute the supply of workers read the links i provided and your question is answered there unemployment is controlled at the macro level by the fed if you understand how that works you will see one of the biggest levers in this discussion instead of making random guesses like you are now also correlation is not causation is becoming a shut up talking point rather than what that phrase was intended for no its really not there are a multitude of factors in play with regards to the question of wage stagnation and the op has highlighted his personal pet peeve with no corroboration to back anything up and not touched on anything else that phrase is absolutely descriptive as to what is happening here two absurd things to link together but might by blind chance see variability explained between the two in a data model no data model provided again do your research or be quiet these opinion threads masquerading as science are fucking stupid
PurplePillDebate,removed,ugeekyfeministdork fits the stereotype of a feminist perfectly thank you for posting you demand your interests and hobbies be taken seriously and respected you are wanting the men you date to be your follower instead of you their follower you are confused about the dynamic of a relationship what you as a woman are what your value as a woman is and likewise are confused about what men are and what their value is you think you are so different and special because youre geeky and a dork yet you confirm awalt incredibly well not that you have an inkling what awalt is or why you conform to it
PurplePillDebate,removed,so chad is not real because that guy you see that looks like chad to you goes to bed at night and has nightmares about his vampirised girlfriend laughing at him with chad caught you trolling here i did go to some dates with chads and no they did not end with wild ahem carouseling and chads are extremely extremely nice and gallant only wannabe aspies think they act like assholes but they look for stacey the sporty girl with whom to go hiking clubbing etc it was clear we did not click
PurplePillDebate,removed,the biggest false reality rp refuses to deal with is the myth that they are average the second biggest myth is that there is some chad out there who can fuck anyone he wants both false beliefs just demonstrate how out of touch with the real smp red pill guys actually are
PurplePillDebate,removed,he is rich
PurplePillDebate,removed,because then it becomes female imperative you singlehandedly decided you and your partner are not going to have sex does the partner know that
PurplePillDebate,removed,you forgot thousand cock stare regardless of how many times you repeat this mantra of women being no different than men you will still be factually incorrect and deluded women give up sex men earn it sex is easy for women hard for men when a woman chooses the easy way of having sex with hot guys she is displaying a lack of character when a man has lots of sex with hot girls he is proving his character

PurplePillDebate,removed,ignoring the jihadi elephant in the room
PurplePillDebate,removed,where did you get the figure from men are half the population hence the youre just going off on a victimhood rant are men not allowed to go off victimhood rants im merely pointing out the hypocrisy and misandry of your average feminist you get butthurt over awalt and trp even though its kinda true claiming were all blank states and gender is a social construct but then you turn around and say that men are entitled and are bombers and terrorists you cant have it both ways this isnt about all men what makes you think it is male entitlement kinda does mean all males
PurplePillDebate,removed,spoken like a true privileged person that seems like an outright personal attack the person you are taking a cheap shot at made a good post and raised good questions if you arent willing to debate its in the name of the sub for chrissakes the least you could do is not sling petty insults sheesh
PurplePillDebate,removed,the guy tells you not to approach people but wait for others to come to you because youll just make a fool out of yourself otherwise the problem is that nobody has ever tried to initiate a conversation with me not once in my years of university not once in highschool fucking never i just stand around and get ignored at any type of event and im invisible in class nobody ever talks to me i shower ever day ive always been clean shaven not overweight dont have any physical deformities and i dress normally yet im a friendless virgin that nobody wants anything to do with if i cant talk to other people and nobody wants to talk to me how the fuck am i supposed to escape this
PurplePillDebate,removed,this partly why i wager why male suicides are up this is what i dont understand why kill yourself when you can kill the people the piss you off and then kill yourself sounds much more productive
PurplePillDebate,removed,your wife gets a raise red pill man gets pissed seems legit

PurplePillDebate,removed,usquidracer you forgot to listen and believe women are always right you fucking idiot
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeh this is what my h does
PurplePillDebate,removed,i can debate without personal attacks i forgot what sub i was in and i edited the post to remove the last line but if im being truly honest id have to remove the first line also is calling someone a white knight not also a personal attack
PurplePillDebate,removed,you just cant handle trp buddy i dont know if you should debate here i dont want you to feel hurt or frustrated by what people talk about here
PurplePillDebate,removed,either i am not as good as expressing myself through text as i think i am or you dont understand because you cant youre bp
PurplePillDebate,removed,you thick bro
PurplePillDebate,removed,come to think of it i have never heard the term loser applied to a woman in my circles but ive heard it bandied around to describe men i think you have to try hard to be called a loser as a woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,and this is exactly why women are almost never interesting and almost never accomplish anything worthwhile no impetus putting on makeup and going to the bar and spending mens money is enough
PurplePillDebate,removed,if i was a woman i would have already have been approved of as worthy because im good looking but being a good looking man noone really cares
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats true at this moment in history a woman who cant keep her shit together is still a strong independent single lady while a man who screws up in a lesser way is universally derided as a loser
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant even be bothered to read the thread to see if soemoen stated the so obviousthatitdoesntneedtobesaid but women win at womenning by acheiving the minimum female accomplishment of getting amrried and having babies there is no such thing for men must must acheive in the world outside of their physicality in order to succeed thats why men can be losers and women largely cant
PurplePillDebate,removed,when i first read the title i thought it was another one of paul feigs tasks to earn the privilege of being stepped on by women but then i read the post yeah men definitely have to get their shit together or they are fucked dont have a job and are only semiattractive you cant marry like a woman for survival got ordered by court to pay alimonychild support whatever even though you dont have a job no welfare house for you only jail
PurplePillDebate,removed,because youre a sad individual
PurplePillDebate,removed,how is it that red pill aware peopel are constantly asking questions like this male sexuality is dangerous to women and frankly repulsive to them when they see it in its full magnitude male and female sexual nature and strategies are mutually incompatible in competition with each other and antagonistic exactly what benefit woudl womend erive from helping men succeed at their sexual strategy at the expense of women what motivation do women have other than to try to make men into what suits their sexual strategies where are these weird moral contracts and expectations so many of you have stop asking women period
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you wish
PurplePillDebate,removed,baloney the actual feminist books literally say that they cannot allow women the right to choose to be a sahm because if they did far too many women would choose this you are simply making shit up ive read the insane feminist books from the women who lead your insane hateful antifreedom movement feminism is about not allowing women the right to choose and choosing for them youve been brainwashed im sorry but now is your chance actually go read the books and stop just regurgitating the dogma youve been forced fed i mean if youre smart enough to do it

PurplePillDebate,removed,lol youre an idiot nigger
PurplePillDebate,removed,women love to submit to a powerful man so just shove it down there if she resists slap her in the face throw her down and jam it back in after youre done cuddle with her and watch the love flow
PurplePillDebate,removed,why argue with these women they dont have your best interests at heart do whatever you want to do to them whenever you want to do it who really cares if they dont like it they dont know what they like anyway

PurplePillDebate,removed,this thread is a large scale confirmation of physical hypergamy from women of every pill color even bp women are not so bp when it comes to physical requirements in men
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey bud youre getting a little repetitive ive already answered all your meaningful questions some of them literally one comment ago yet youre just asking the same questions again are you doing ok we can take a break from this discussion if you need one it seems like it might do you good to take a couple deep breaths and try to calm down
PurplePillDebate,removed,at first i wanted to have some fun making fun of you but now i just feel bad i hadnt realized your mental state was this fragileguess thats the downside of poking redpillers you never know when youre going to seriously trigger one of them ill give you a bit of space to try to pull yourself together its the least i can do for someone like you try to talk this out with your partner or someone else in your emotional support network ok it seems like you really need the helppoor little guy enjoy the rest of your day

PurplePillDebate,removed,spare me your bullshit any feminist will go on and on about challenging gender norms if you dint have to challenge your preference for tall then men dont have to challenge their aversion toward women with high n counts
PurplePillDebate,removed,such a feminist wow much strong much independence
PurplePillDebate,removed,meditate work out master a skill travel accept that life is fucked up and we are all going to die eventually find things you are grateful for and say them out loud right before you go to sleep smile at everyone meditate and date a short guy some of them are amazing just like some single moms oh wait youd never date a short guy im my boyfriend is i prefer very tall im high school i dated college after college today last and final not sure what that means but for me sex has gotten better over the years and i think the height made a difference but im tall so theres that i used to get mad at short girls who took all the tall guys lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,you have those rights but you also bitch and whine about gender norms so maybe you should stop being such a hypocrite
PurplePillDebate,removed,dismal no more difficult yes im so the standards of masculinity that i have to live up to are much much higher i will continue to oppose feminism at every turn and im comforted by the fact that rtheredpill comtimues to grow and spread more men will become aware of the lies of equality then feminism fed them also check your female privilege you dumb tall chasing cunt
PurplePillDebate,removed,gotta take time off from retard wrangling because of muh election
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice hypergamy
PurplePillDebate,removed,also you dont need to say younger and hotter thats redundant shes hotter than you by default because shes younger
PurplePillDebate,removed,you as in the feminist stay on track sweetie
PurplePillDebate,removed,it wasnt a personal attack it was an accurate observation
PurplePillDebate,removed,the lie i was referring to was that tall women even remotely experience anything similar to what short men go through but thanks for the anecdata your relationship wont last as evidenced by your something very attractive about being with someone taller mindset ticking time bomb of hypergamy
PurplePillDebate,removed,you did not exactly link two serious videos did you group of neckbeards trying to form a prorape group
PurplePillDebate,removed,ugly cunts being cunty oh and male abuse and child support stuff

PurplePillDebate,removed,some pigs are more equal than others
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh forgive me i forgot a guys only two options are a running away b violence i guess coming up with a response would have been putting two much strain on his brain having those two neurones rub together hurts
PurplePillDebate,removed,how much do you weigh
PurplePillDebate,removed,my shit posts arent angry they are passionate you chodes are so close im rooting for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound like an absolute relic probably be happier in sa or somewhere

PurplePillDebate,removed,trans is mental illness gender is determined by your chromosomes
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a woman so you would not even know how to shoot the thing or have the balls oh wait
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists are terrorists
PurplePillDebate,removed,i get to trigger geekyfeministmisandrist just by having my red flar show up
PurplePillDebate,removed,it wouldnt matter what i say like nearly every feminist ive spoken to i can anticipate your response youll just reframe what i say to fit your narrative i say female privilege you say benevolent sexism i say misandry you say patriarchy backfiring i say male objectification you say just a preference nothing i say would penetrate your foggy feminist lense
PurplePillDebate,removed,probably when white people want to become sand people something is off
PurplePillDebate,removed,clearly they do enjoy it i never said they dont people also enjoy doing cocaine maybe we snould all stop this opreshun and start being cocainpositive cocainsts
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not bad it is just nothing to brag about besides brushing teeth is a bad example it may be easy as in low effort but it is not exactly a pleasant thing to do a more appropriate example would be drinking or doing drugs being a cocaine addict is easy and shows lack of character being a videogame addict is easy and shows lack of character hurting those weaker than you is easy and shows lack of character competing with elementary school students is easy and shows lack of character having sex with a minor or from a position of power is easy and shows lack of character
PurplePillDebate,removed,because having character requires one to fight the temptations the temptations of easy sex the temptations of easy pleasure from another dose the temptations of power abuse etc sex is hard to get for men so naturally if you get lots of it it is admirable and the reverse for women does a woman who has no sex display character while a man who has no sex displays a lack of it i wouldnt claim that it doesnt have to be true logic doesnt always work both ways
PurplePillDebate,removed,no what are you smoking its clearly anxiety and depressioninducing emotional abuse and everyone who does it should be killed
PurplePillDebate,removed,today i saw this on bustle from a sexpositive feminist author about which guys women prefer for a casual fling which unlike most things on bustle i found quite interesting and the reason why is because its content if it came from anywhere else would not doubt be derided rapidly as much as we love to throw around the old anecdote about how men think with their penises women are guilty of thinking about what gets them sexually excited too — when it comes to shortterm love affairs theyre not looking past living in the moment so someone who takes risks is more attractive than the person who plays it safe women especially younger women are turned on more by the cool guy alexander tells bustle the cool guy is the player type the one who all the girls want to date the one who is unattainable and if im to be honest usually the unattainable bad boy or girl is fleeting these cool guys typically have a devilmaycare attitude thus they are more prone to being reckless in all areas of their life says alexander they drink they smoke they may be careless about other behaviors as well there is something primal about this according to alexander this need to be excited by the bad boy is more likely to be founder in younger women for them the nice guy is boring its only after they get their hearts broken do they realize that this cool guy is not all fun and games says alexander men might actually be aware of what their risky behavior is doing unlike women when it comes looking for a shortterm partner men couldnt care less if a woman indulges in risky behavior or not they like the cool girl too but for them the cool girl is the one who is confident and selfassured says alexander so according to this author women want to have sex with risque unattainable bad boys who have a reckless careless attitude who need to break their hearts after having sex with them before women switch a type as they grow older they find nice guys boring and men are aware of that tendency in women purposefully faking it just for them even if they arent like this naturally to top it all men themselves do not share that same mindset with women even without rephrasing anything into more blunt terms or manospherian slang all of the conclusions in this article look as if they could come directly from an hardcore redpiller or any angry incel where they wouldve been immediately ridiculed as delusional bitter misogynistic niceguy myths well next time someone asks these guys where they got their beliefs on womens sexual behavior from they could cite your friendlyneighborhood sexpositive feminist publication bustle since apparently this is the kind of information you can derive from reading it
PurplePillDebate,removed,automod not showing but it should be there it says comments but i can only see happens from time to time use this post for your shit posts and bullshit i will start
PurplePillDebate,removed,i said women arent obligated to date betas learn to read society tries to force the idea that men need to grow up and date single mothers or that men are immature for liking younger men and preferring not to date women over a certain age bracket men have no obligation to date these women the same way women have no obligation to date men they deem undesirabe
PurplePillDebate,removed,she your right hand identifies as female to the mods yeah yeah cant attack people but come on how could that be left just hanging out there like that forgive me
PurplePillDebate,removed,cute wheres the personal attack wheres the slur or direct insult you guys really are bias to your own kind and thats not just me being salty the bloopers attack us with much more venom but were not so fickle to report it every time it happens do they really need you guys to defend them when things get heated sad

PurplePillDebate,removed,oh no im not here to debate its absolutely pointless with you lot might as well be shouting into a hole in the ground im simply here to vent and express my extreme disdain and disgust for you subhuman shitlords ya feel me
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck you and fuck all women who are stupid and heartless and selfcentered and unimaginative and unempathetic and ignorant enough to think about male virginity and incelness like you do you spout the exact same shit that women spout who have never given it much thought takes you about minutes to come to your conclusion wow you figured out what male suffering with lobeliness and lack of intimate validation means in minutes mad props oh waitno you didnt thats fine you dont have to butjust shut up and dont be so arrogant to write insulting shit like your op you have no empathy no sympathy no understanding and you are too lazy and heartless to imagine how it must really be but decide to write about it you should be ashamed of yourself you have no decency if you just dont care no problem but shut the fuck up ps when i lost my virginity everything changed for the better really everything there is not a single aspect in ones life that doesnt get better after losing ones virginity and no you cannot get the validation you get through sex by doing other stuff and no sex doesnt just find you if you are a guy
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a prostitute thoughso your opinion is kinda worthless on that subject dont you think
PurplePillDebate,removed,orbiters
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must know that you dont speak for all men i assume youre extremely beta everything about you is begging for approval only now its from men not women just reading you i can tell that if you were in a street fight even a canadian street fight you would literally cry and cry and cry and hope the rcmp were coming to save your quivering sobbing sad ass stop trying to be red pill until you are ready you are really embarrassingstupid full of unwarranted hubris and way too needy
PurplePillDebate,removed,he was an inferior option he was a partner who wasnt willing to ensure she was comfortable or that she trusted him ie not a good partner for her ie bullet dodged he also dodged one from his pov because he wants sex she wasnt giving it up no sex bullet dodged

PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree im just annoyed that she didnt answer despite being completely wrong the arrogance required amazes me and from such a redpilled person outright a bluepill view regarding rights blew me away
PurplePillDebate,removed,shes right im far from hot i have a ton of deal breakers and none of it matters because my natural altruism was the kind that made friends fast and allowed me to meet people through my social circles you confuse altruism with being socially inept no looks and no sense of style all of which are serious handicaps that knock off any points scored by personality whenever those things are combined your hamster kicks in hard you demonstrate a lack of selfawareness or curiosity and an inability to adapt
PurplePillDebate,removed,i bet he bangs fat bluehaired feminist crazies or they bang him
PurplePillDebate,removed,short guys are doomed to have a sexless life in a tall country what you can do move to another country with shorter people this usually means a country where life is hard and food is not plentiful in the us people eat so much there is actually a fat epidemic learn to live without needing sex with women or female company youre short your reflexes are superior because nerve signals have to travel less you can beat an asian at starcraft so get to it make guy friends instead make online guy friends that you can play videogames with your sex drive will decline the older you get but your need for company will not guys make better actual friends women are retarded anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,its obvious what kind of circles your experience comes from
PurplePillDebate,removed,theyre all indian and asian in western countries thats the problem no one wants to admit
PurplePillDebate,removed,what the fuck does that even mean
PurplePillDebate,removed,and women seethe with anger and resentment at this the of the world absolutely hate that they have to settle for particularly after having had hot sex with and then being rejected by those just come out of the closet already
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes here to troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,it adds something she mentioned it so it means its relevant not my fault youre a short fat fuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,just because the css hides it doesnt mean that people cant downvote you also what do you mean that women are all the same
PurplePillDebate,removed,they think a deadbedrooms represents all of married reality
PurplePillDebate,removed,ha yes and i know a hottie who is absolutely crazy over her asian boyfriend who isnt really a prize thats exactly what i mean if you obsess over theory and science and statistics and start to think in terms like genetically inferior my god you might be convinced that no asian guy will be lovedever but its simply not true its ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre full of shit truth is you would not affect anyone youd be going around saying their dick is small lmfao you can leave now we dont need delusional little girls here

PurplePillDebate,removed,uleanegenova how do you like the circlejerking
PurplePillDebate,removed,lolwhut
PurplePillDebate,removed,i havent discussed my opinion of the user thank you very much i have however made observations and posted my opinion of the subject matter the user is posting and that is relevant i have not attacked the users character only the subject matter they post
PurplePillDebate,removed,bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh no no free shit d
PurplePillDebate,removed,you ok buddy
PurplePillDebate,removed,reread my first comment
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really need to be less disingenuous an abusive marriage has sufficient reason for divorce legally it doesnt need no fault divorce most countries with modern legal systems list abuse as one of the conditions for divorce without that your argument looks pretty thin which i guess explains why you put that red herring in there i hope you understand that by making up stuff you destroy your credibility which makes lying to bolster a weak argument fairly counterproductive
PurplePillDebate,removed,your partner is not cattle let them be an asshole if they like it a good healthy marriage should not be like that
PurplePillDebate,removed,if there are no any obligations in marriage for the other partner why would you marry at all just be a forever girlfriend and boyfriend
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant decide for other people sadly
PurplePillDebate,removed,marriage is not for making kids kids are a side effect because kids primarily benefit the mother its not like i can think i want myself a kid and then marry someone that aint going to work before i know it we are getting divorced and the mother is taking the kid so marriage should be about the person you are marrying instead commitment for commitment money and commitment of a man for sex and commitment of a woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,after all we live in a rape culture men can freely rape women get applauded for it and then the woman has to go to prison for extra maternal sex
PurplePillDebate,removed,i see a well meaning attempt from some feminists who seem unaware how cruel girls can be or how that video comes across to many boys but if all feminists are like that how can you complain when they claim all men are like that youre both doing the exact same thing
PurplePillDebate,removed,man you got that from that video so instead of saying damn there might be some issues that young girls have to deal with youre like it says feminists think all men are rapists so i think my problem with trp on top of the misogyny rape apologia and general douchebaggery is taking something and exaggerating it to fit your narrative
PurplePillDebate,removed,in this case my problem is making false claims pretty ironic false claims considering the fact that trp advocates for the slogan that all women are like that projecting much
PurplePillDebate,removed,the accents killed it for me couldnt watch
PurplePillDebate,removed,do not post content like this here again so no posts showing true feminist colors are allowed
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure then i will make a better post next time hopefully it wont break any rules to give a justification for removal i have posted my idea three times in different posts and three times it has been removed by a mod two times without a corresponding message with a reason i have an idea and i am unable to discuss it with others i feel silenced and im not liking it
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont marry with a random woman just so that you can have a kid for yourself it doesnt work like that the woman will simply leave you and you will be left with child support and alimony and no child you marry a woman you think is wife material and then maybe you make a child the point i was making is this difference
PurplePillDebate,removed,again the woman you marry or rather the choice of a woman that you make is more important than the fact that you want a kid because children are for the woman primarily you are not getting the custody of the children unless in some very specific cases so wanting kids does not justify marriage when a dude marries a shitty woman he cannot say at least i have kids now because he will only have kids if the woman is not shitty so the only sensible thing to say is i married a good woman and now i have kids she loves me and we now have a family
PurplePillDebate,removed,women are strong and independent they dont need no man
PurplePillDebate,removed,hows that releveant
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes but hows that relevant im not disagreeing i was making a different point
PurplePillDebate,removed,hence if youre family oriented finding a marriage partner who actually wants a family is more important than finding one who wants a wife or a husband or wedding but thats what youre refusing to understand there will be no family and no kids for you if the woman you marry is a bad wife
PurplePillDebate,removed,well im fine with your definition but to me a woman wanting a family which includes an so and kids does not guarantee she will be a good wife which in consequence does not guarantee there will be a family at all on the other hand if the wife is a good wife the family comes naturally with or without kids
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is hard to fight your instincts it is hard to get your shit together and stop procrastinating on reddit it is hard to not stay up too late because somebody is wrong on the internet it is hard to give up an immediate reward even when logically you understand that waiting a little will get you more so women submitting to their natural urges is understandable
PurplePillDebate,removed,no apparently hes a young kid just got himself into some trouble what a little rascal
PurplePillDebate,removed,pissing everywhere sure thats why they invented haha
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes just being a silly little kid little kids do that all the time no
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah greeklady does take the cake on this one i wonder if she has a job or how she passes the time when shes not on reddit
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must be unnattractive not ridiculous its true
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok i was reminiscing about an old female writer i liked and it took me long enough—from the end of my virginity to my first single summer at twentyone—to learn the trick of sleeping with someone without waking up obsessed and even then it didnt exactly become my superpower it was easy to stop believing that sex is between a husband and wife as my parents had taught me it was less easy to stop believing that sex is between two people who love each other very much as my friends parents had taught them whether its alpha widow draining the feeling of novelty seeing patterns instead of people via the collection of data whatever its a thing at least for lots of women shes totally hypergamous though has fucked photographers was fucked in a hotel room by a famous artist on coke she got engaged at
PurplePillDebate,removed,sometimes men are just idiots and prioritise pleasure over safety men dont give a shit because years of life experience indicating to men that its not easy for men results in risky behaviour you just wouldnt understand that being female idiotic is the wrong choice of words
PurplePillDebate,removed,its her defence mechanism
PurplePillDebate,removed,id marry me because im ridiculously attractive i split the work despite what you may think but i decide who does what and i dont secretly want to fuck anybody i express my desire openly like the dog i am i love my wife and i simultaneously like her convenient set of holes crazy right and i would never destroy her or anyone for that matter financially or emotionally i would also love to have kids i wouldnt marry a trp subscriber if i were you though because hell likely see through your bullshit and never give you a chance
PurplePillDebate,removed,and we can say all that because its a male strategy sub
PurplePillDebate,removed,remember rp sets its standards of success by being able to pick up and fuck the hottest woman in da club on any given night this is how alpha males are defined apparently women who are not in that world do not really exist to them
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp doesnt work on old women because theyre done with fucking alpha males and are now into beta buxs
PurplePillDebate,removed,most women dont want alphas we want high betas lol and even though very few rpers are alpha thats what they want to be and thats what they try to emulate fake it til you make it princess
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are nasty people who cares what you do in bed
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe youre just jealous
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh no the gold digging afbb practicing whores dont want to marry rp men anymore whatever are those rp guys ever going to do without your high n count your incessant demands your tepid duty sex and your fucking chad on the side wont someone think of the poor rp males
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes you are a prime example
PurplePillDebate,removed,its idiotic to have unprotected sex with a woman who sells sex for money if shes doing it with you you can safely assume shes doing it with all of her other partners tf noones talking about fucking you that was in response to this thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,those bastards
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeh and stalking me wtf are you ok
PurplePillDebate,removed,i see you and see the exact result of feminism you grabbed for power both ways both by becoming a lawyer and professional whore amazing in ways horrifying in others
PurplePillDebate,removed,like i said the context of this was in regard to the topic you responded to my post about how men try to not use condoms with me and how this was idiotic nope i was talking about people fucking me well why are you talking about that sorry i dont want to fuck you
PurplePillDebate,removed,a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle i wouldnt say that where else are they going to get their validation and approval from
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are you editing your responses do i really psychologically fuck you that bad sorry about that and haha im so upset im going to spend the rest of the night crying really mate calm down i didnt get ppd confused with the craigslist casual encounters section and even if i had you wouldnt be on my to do list try to be strong youll hopefully get over it
PurplePillDebate,removed,shakes head in pity why are you still going i feel like im obtaining a disease from this conversation
PurplePillDebate,removed,fair enough i just want to put the contrast out there for any baby rps that might otherwise assume no woman wants to be with a man that she respects
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol idontbelieveyoujpg
PurplePillDebate,removed,socalled satire is wasted on red pillers because we dngaf about your ignorant ass opinions but to address you silly points man mows lawn woman does dishes how oppressive is that and there is good evidence that shows that men who choreplay have shitty relationships so why go there i cook and many other men do so that is not outlier material or anything men love women but not in the same way that women love men for some of the players sex is an act of conquest or dealing with their other inadequacies but for your typical guy it is an act of intimacy if and when a woman fucks the living shit out of a guys then dollars to donuts he will fall in love with her men want to be fathers and want to be allowed to be fathers trpers have not destroyed traditional marriage they have abandoned it because feminism has warped it into something really dangerous and oppressive
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes your big d privilege is triggering me where is the trigger warning where is my safe space why the rampart misandry in your post i can even ps posting as a male version of a delusional femme is fun i should do this more often read some tbp for inspiration reverse the genders in the moronic outbursts and ridiculous statements and viola
PurplePillDebate,removed,wut
PurplePillDebate,removed,again fuck off all the reasons you just listed are not why people join the military
PurplePillDebate,removed,perhaps he makes a statement considering tans gay everythings allowed but incels go to fucking hell you pathetic pieces of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,facepalm slowly slides hand down
PurplePillDebate,removed,you see that other post thats why people would dismiss you before wasting their time
PurplePillDebate,removed,no im in disagreement your analogy was completely incorrect and its damaging and must be restricted
PurplePillDebate,removed,how was it stupid a woman can claim rape and the entire system will work to ruin the mans life the duluth model insists the male is almost always arrested during domestic violence situations a woman can claim abuse during divorce however fraudulent and women get everything in divorce women get preferntial hiring in all government jobs plus more scholarships and even private company hiring quotas women get less jail time for the same exact crimes
PurplePillDebate,removed,still no answers other than trust a woman and ensure she is a good woman so basically you want men to be at the mercy of a woman lying lovely
PurplePillDebate,removed,doesnt have to go to court to end your life court of public opinion or even the charge ends your life so again zero way for men to protect themselves just like you want itd
PurplePillDebate,removed,bingo hes paying lipservice to false ideals be doesnt believe in similar to liberals
PurplePillDebate,removed,hmm strokes chin the reductionism is strong in this one
PurplePillDebate,removed,i suggest you watch daniel dennetts ted talk its enlightening will answer your question and save you from wasting mine
PurplePillDebate,removed,then having sex with birth control should not count
PurplePillDebate,removed,this question shows ignorance by calling transgenders a fad i have known people who struggle with their gender identity some have killed themselves it is not a fun problen to deal with whether it is mental illness exposure to hormones in the womb or social maladjustment is the question this hateful question disguised as a post is just facile are you christian if so your stupidity makes perfect sense now
PurplePillDebate,removed,calling women dumb bimbos sounds like youre already an unethical asshole hows it working out for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,pretty confident that its nothing more than twomen wanting to be treated as real people women rather than freaks and having the courage to stand up and demand their rights as members of our society
PurplePillDebate,removed,the more time i spend on reddit the more i realize that murder can be a good thing sometimes
PurplePillDebate,removed,and it was at that moment that anundecidedpill got roasted and completely shut down
PurplePillDebate,removed,see if you can figure it out toodles
PurplePillDebate,removed,the numbers are you describing the nuclear family which literally as an institution has existed basically our evolutionary existence which now is in he verge of being dead or the socioeconomic decline of the standard of living and spike of the top what fucking numbers the ones youre pulling from your asshole for your nonexistent rebuttal
PurplePillDebate,removed,😹😂😹😂😹😂😹
PurplePillDebate,removed,too few words youre an idiot
PurplePillDebate,removed,prostitution is legal where i live prostitutes still make bank its a taxing profession physically mentally social stigma etc most women shy away from sex work even when it is legal so the supplydemand dynamic remains similar the industry is much safer here though eh my painter friends earn as much as my doctor lawyer friends and their jobs are infinitely easier capitalism does not work hard to make your money capitalism manipulate whatever niche in the market you can to make your money
PurplePillDebate,removed,it isnt completely dead fool but in japan the trends among millennials show that young professionals would prefer freedom over the responsibilities of parenthood
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah
PurplePillDebate,removed,if theres a different explanation i could be persuaded considering its an ad for a pain reliever my first thought was being filmed puking into the toilet with a hangover my mind didnt go to sex at all let alone nonconsensual sex you perv
PurplePillDebate,removed,how is it relevant well when one person talks to another person and the topic of conversation flows from one idea to another the original person will likely respond to that idea with their own opinion why do i need to explain conversation dynamics to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,they dont need to go to trial to ruin someones lives the duke kids lives were ruined mattress girls victim ect ect but you dont care about men thanks for proving trps point men will continue to be encouraged to do this and save texts
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do
PurplePillDebate,removed,this post makes you sound like a creep lolll
PurplePillDebate,removed,you have to because of the consent craze
PurplePillDebate,removed,except tbp isnt targeting straight white males they just target those in the manosohere im pretty sure that men in the manosohere dont represent all straight white men now i might be wrong buuuuuut something tells me that im not
PurplePillDebate,removed,to be entirely honest i cant tell whether this is sarcasm or not because of the grammar much confusion if that is something that happened though then i must have missed it was it recent or a really long time ago i havent really been looking into that sub as often as i used to so i must have missed it
PurplePillDebate,removed,well thought out argument care to link me to a source
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really need to learn to read more than just a word or two that send you into a red rage if a woman wants to be groped does this fail to convey the concept of consensuality consensualness i am going for i dont care if you read trump and grope and reach for your rape whistle thats on you i really couldnt make it more clear if a woman consents to being groped it isnt sexual assault its foreplay do you still not see the problem i have with bloopers a few years ago i would have said you cant be this dense clearly youre being willfully obtuse now im not sure i think you really are all that dense its like information that contradicts your neat little feminist worldview in any way cannot be processed i know that you really want grope to mean sexual assault but it really doesnt i get that you want everyone who disagrees with you to be a horrible person but mostly we arent the world is not that simple despite your indoctrination god damn arguing with a feminist is like yelling at the clouds to stop raining on you it doesnt change anything and you just look like a fool for trying
PurplePillDebate,removed,ad hominems seriously if you had presented any sort of argument and i had attacked you in an effort to discredit your argument that would be an ad hominem you have no argument to discredit just your feels youre wrong youve always been wrong and youll always be wrong im running out of different ways to reiterate what i said in the first place but you still refuse to understand my time would be better spent explaining particle physics to a dog than defining a simple english word for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,no brer fox dont throw me in that briar patch conversing with you is the only thing that makes my bone cancer seem pleasant by comparison now ill have to go back to jabbing bamboo splinters under my fingers while listening to coldplay
PurplePillDebate,removed,you have a better grasp of the meaning than usublimemongrel does i specifically deliberately stated that i was talking about consensual groping i pasted the dictionary definition i quoted myself and restated the same thing in three different ways shes hopeless she insists that i was referring to nonconsensual groping whatever she claims to be a lawyer but cant form an argument and doesnt know what words mean also your english is impeccable
PurplePillDebate,removed,you think a lot of things that are incorrect you assume everyone who disagrees with you must be red pill
PurplePillDebate,removed,i exaggerated i have osteoarthritis and carpal tunnel issues by exaggerated i mean i made it up i dont have any cancer i am aware of it was the only thing i could think of that was as painful as trying to explain logic to a feminist you can go back to being done with me now
PurplePillDebate,removed,seriously groping someone who wants to be groped by you is consensual it just is thats sort of what consensual means groping someone who you think wants you to but doesnt will get you maced that is the context in which i used it i dont need a sugarcoated meaning all the words you needed to understand were right there everyone else seems to get it you are the only one who doesnt get it and you never will
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound bitter
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is another obvious example of sophistry i suppose its hypocritical that woman want tall guys when they are not tall themselves women do not shame short guys choosing not to mate with someone and actively abusing someone are two different things or wanting a masculine guy when she is not masculine herself is this a serious comparison youre saying that a woman wanting a masculine guy as a partner and women abusing women for having what are perceived to be too many sexual partners are somehow comparable what complete idiocy or the any number of the hundreds of different preferences men and women have where did i say that men shouldnt have the choice of mating with whoever they select obviously this is personal choice i am simply saying that men shouldnt abuse women for making the same personal choices that they make im not going to bother pointing out the other logical fallacies in this post you obviously didnt have that many brain cells to begin with so i wouldnt worry about losing a few
PurplePillDebate,removed,ppd already knows your women are wonderful stance i expected you to dismiss this post
PurplePillDebate,removed,beta bob gets shamed for being a nice guy to try and sleep with women because hes acting like a chick fem lordess gets shamed for being a cool girl because shes acting like a dude bob and lordess may be physically attractive but any time spend with them will clearly be a turn off but your post is one example of this if a woman will exclude you from acts shes done in the past but require your time attention and commitment showing them the fucking door be sure to laugh when they say youre just intimidated by her experience
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not a bper but i can easily see this occurs in black american communities quite a lot just because of the overarching culture its nowhere near as prevalent in the extremely whitebread world that i live in although it is a valid observation that if youre too supplicating then its unsexy
PurplePillDebate,removed,just because you dont like that fact that other people can make their own choices and gasp be public about those choices ie to reject sluts for marriage does not mean its abuse get a grip man you are all over ppd today shouting increasingly rabid accusations of abuse everywhere take a break you are losing it
PurplePillDebate,removed,there you go again all chicken little crying about abuse when all it is is people voicing their opinions just because you dont like someones opinion does not make it abuse
PurplePillDebate,removed,idk she has been crying about abuse with every response
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes pretty obviously a dude from all of his posts including these ones no woman would post this shit because all the responses would just be u just mad no one wants to date u slut
PurplePillDebate,removed,if a mans gonna decide to be a slob it shows that theres no point in cleaning up after him over and over again kill yourself so it gets to be a filth pit again no point
PurplePillDebate,removed,no you just got all emotional and upset and started flinging shit at me for no reason i dont tolerate that
PurplePillDebate,removed,i read the fucking thread i am responding to your silly claim that rejecting women or not dating them or not investing in them because theyre sluts or even out and out calling a woman a slut is not abusive read my fucking comment before you respond or dont fucking respond at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,this post isnt for women you dont know what you like so i dont particularly care what you want to convince me what works on you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah thats the textbook empowered woman answer for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is true to an extent i do think there is a point for every man where a womans sluttiness becomes too much for some it can be more than and for some it could be more than i think ideally though most men would prefer lower n count over higher all things equal personally if i had an absurd n count of like and a girl i like had like i would definitely not care as much but yes to say that insecurity on the mans side doesnt play a role in this is just ignorant of reality
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok thats a
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is even the point of this thread seriously and no there are actual very strong biological reasons for men to prefer low ncount partners but what it does it even matter the high value men you want will always have options and when they decide to settle down if they ever do theyll still chose a low ncount partner no matter what you or anyone else says the only men who might actually fall for that rubbish if for no other reason than theyre in desperate need of a cope are the ones you and other women have no interest to begin with so quit your yapping already will you
PurplePillDebate,removed,me that was fairly purposeless yet oddly fun thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,white knighting mangina alert shes not gonna love u now bro shes getting a fix watching u fight for her even though you mean nothing to her
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre saying its not diesel
PurplePillDebate,removed,which i thought was them applying these negative characterizations in an overbroad way now its actually something else very womany
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont wave your false woman penis in my face ill bite it off
PurplePillDebate,removed,nope men are the only ones who shame they shame betas alphas sluts and each other
PurplePillDebate,removed,nooooooo my alpha males points please daddy teach me how to be more alpha like you where do i buy a frame and a plate
PurplePillDebate,removed,howdareyounottakemyadvice you dont want to be happy pity party
PurplePillDebate,removed,sounds like you fed a hamster this morning
PurplePillDebate,removed,you probably deserved it
PurplePillDebate,removed,intentionally not interacting with your partner and intentionally talking to other women so that your partner sees for the intention of making her worry about losing you to another woman is playing with emotions and insecurities emotional manipulationabuse is an asshole thing to do why is emotional abuse so im not allowed to talk to women in front of my woman because it may make her insecure im a social person i love meeting new people i need to only talk to women she doesnt worry about women emotionally manipulate all the god damn time too passing shit tests red pill men are urged to be condescending patronizing or entirely dismissive when their partners bring up issues to be discussed being dismissivepatronizing towards your partner over relationship issues is emotionally abusive people deserve to be taken seriously in their relationships why is it abusive like of the shit women demand is utterly irrelevant and not actually needed the remainder of stuff is perhaps serious do i really need to explain why negging is abusive yes actually though i can guess why it feels bad so therefor its abusive how very bp and feminine making someone feel bad is wrong red pill also generally urges men to be sexually aggressive impulsive and misogynistic whats wrong with being sexual aggressive its mans nature to be same with impulsive again male nature perhaps you have repressed this side of you as i once did in the past
PurplePillDebate,removed,facepalm go read the sidebar before you debate on ppd or is that too much reading for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i did say she needs to be thin but yeah money does wonders hehehehehehehe im red pill hear me roar ooooh look a woman with money im whore im a whore im a whore
PurplePillDebate,removed,suck that d my n
PurplePillDebate,removed,bs my mother is one of the most rational smart calm and loving people i know my ex wife was a smart beautiful and socially engaging person when i met her in time i learned that behind that wonderful persona hid the mind of a sociopath feminist incapable of taking responsibility for her actions and yet wont to see especially towards the end every loving act as the sign of me being a chauvinist examples i bring home dinner one night without asking her what she wanted to eat because she doesnt cook remembering to include a few of her favorite dishes i am a power mad chauvinist trying to dictate what she eats i stay up nights by her bedside when she was in the hospital for illness after a hour workday i have control issues i became red pill after she destroyed the marriage our shared dreams and left me to navigate my middle age and old age alone after robbing me blind aided and abetted by feminist divorce courts red pill was an important factor in me choosing not to commit suicide many men arent as lucky feminist liars like you keep trying to pretend that effect precedes cause maybe under exotic conditions in relativity not in daily life
PurplePillDebate,removed,you have to be autistic not to see its quite clearly satire
PurplePillDebate,removed,rtbp i am a bot i link the subreddits mentioned in the title for easy navigation
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wouldnt read too deep into that particular post other than its pretty crappy humor but tbp has its fair share of people in the anger phase that display pretty unhealthy feelings towards men tbp members will naturally minimize or deny it exactly the same way trp members do about their own hateful members
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont have to go to tbp to experience misandry just watch a commercial you are more likely to see a man being shown as a buffoon than a woman being denigrated misandry is both legally protected and mainstream now
PurplePillDebate,removed,loooooooooooooooooool
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree its completely unintelligible judging from his posting history he seems somewhat obsessed with age how it can be bad for dating so why does his view supposedly say that you can never be too old or too young his completely incomprehensible post seems roughly to lean in the other direction but who can say also surely years may be too old for some people and years is too young why cant i downvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,your mislabeling my sentiment i say different and you hear inferior i cant unproject your insecurities for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre only including consensual sex for sex in general
PurplePillDebate,removed,it just happens i never specified that all girls are fucking like rabbits i just said its those girls who cause the outrage in the forum sorry cheapening yourself through impulsive irresponsible behavior may fly on tbp but it makes me sad
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah everything is mens fault which is why i think men should just stop bothering chasing women in any way the quicker more men turn into something like the herbivore men in japan the faster the human population will decline therefore stopping all problems
PurplePillDebate,removed,repill men are subhuman trash what they value should be mocked along with their personalities and penis size
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are a reactionary against mgtow you are reacting against men wanting to remove women from their lives by being a woman who isnt making sense and is a reaction to a reaction thats going to change heaps of mgtows minds s
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you arent a reactionary against the reaction its now selfpreservation would you like to pick a train of thought and stick to it or are you intending on proving why men are better off without this kind of behaviour in their homes
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you know a redpiller just tell the cops he raped you theyll sort it out
PurplePillDebate,removed,nailed it were done here thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,even if they get a trail and are found not guilty itll still ruin his reputation and career thats good enough for me
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont care about being independent i keep saying this but you idiots dont get it i believe in interdependence in relationships where both people help each other my point is he should have looked at her character first instead of going based on whatever would give him more status
PurplePillDebate,removed,bingo the only thing that that a woman could find hurtful from me is that i dont want to date them or be intimate with them and thats no different to when they turn down another guy that is trying to ask them out therefore the only thing left that women could possibly be upset about with mgtow is that men are not available to have their resources extracted
PurplePillDebate,removed,that literally doesnt mean that independence doesnt exist try again
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are very naive
PurplePillDebate,removed,why would any woman want to be with a man that she feels she has to lie to yeah silly me youre right a woman would never lie to a man she is with what was i thinking hilarious
PurplePillDebate,removed,mm
PurplePillDebate,removed,so i cant take a quote out of context but you can and complaining about punctuation with your standard of grammar is not something you should be doing just saying
PurplePillDebate,removed,yikes
PurplePillDebate,removed,everyone should pay close attention to this post as it is a perfect example of the female mind its so subtle no wonder it works on most men
PurplePillDebate,removed,i weep for thee
PurplePillDebate,removed,its ironic because this girl is lying right now it doesnt make sense to me that a woman would want to be with someone who makes her feel she has to lie about herself and her past i mean dear fucking christ just look at this thing it would almost be impressive if it wasnt so hilariously sad
PurplePillDebate,removed,yep im reading the hamsters hamster away the double standard right here its inexcusable logically inexcusable it doesnt matter what the two people are like the betrayal is one and the same but no women can never be at fault women always have the best interests of both parties in the relationship women are moral and can never ever do bad things men are the true aggressors in every scenario i dont know what i was expecting the bloopers can never ever admit theyre wrong they dig in their heels and make snarky comments thinking it makes them right they just cant stand to accept that we pillers are right about some things in fact a lot of things they like being edgey because for them the delivery of the argument always trumps the logicity of it they spout the same arguments over and over again even when weve adequately addressed them im just straight up disappointed op made a great post the hamsters are still going in the comments if this is what bloopers truly believe then im done with thinking theyre even worth debating anymore lost causes literally what a bunch of women i think ive become even more of a sexist since browsing this sub if this is what the smartest of the bp world has to offer well then
PurplePillDebate,removed,ah yes i have used my crystal ball many a timesit is now telling me that you are in fact a lousy lay
PurplePillDebate,removed,this thread looks promising have an upvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,a visitor from the red planet looking for more guy friends
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure you seem to have a real infatuation with me based on you following me around and commenting on all my posts like a teenage girl i can give you what you want if ur cute but you might be a bit far away xxx
PurplePillDebate,removed,then she needs to stop calling people idiots
PurplePillDebate,removed,my snapchat is cheekycunt come at me girl if you have the balls
PurplePillDebate,removed,wtf who are you you do something
PurplePillDebate,removed,in fact nah fuck it youre being a power hungry cunt and i dont give a fuck about your self absorbed little power trip ban away fuck face and enjoy your stay decline of a subreddit thats being moderated to death peace out
PurplePillDebate,removed,thread are you guys for real x
PurplePillDebate,removed,blunt is uncivil if all you know how to communicate in is blunt please find somewhere else to discuss things thx
PurplePillDebate,removed,he needs to talk to his wife to find out if an abortion actually happened and take it from there right now all he knows is that she had a routine gynecological procedure talk talk talk x needs to talk to y did you come here from twox deadbedrooms relationship if you have a wife that has a medical procedureand doesnt even bother mentioning it you are so fucking far beyond the stupid boilerplate talk advice its not even funny
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok so you see them as workhorses
PurplePillDebate,removed,i use to think false rape accusations were immoral but ive grown to view them as useful tools of ruining the lives of people who annoy you
PurplePillDebate,removed,uhmy quote was the evidence did you even read it can you really not see how subtle manipulative it is i mean i can spell it out if you want
PurplePillDebate,removed,more like uskiinnysweaty got caught arguing against his own words
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah youre a joke
PurplePillDebate,removed,the point of my post was to bring to light a common tactic women use to shift blame while this is off the main topic it is relevant to the topic at hand because she is talking about lying and her argument is intellectually dishonest i didnt attack her i attacked her action i dont care about the user i care about the ideas she is putting forth it doesnt make sense to me that a woman would want to be with someone who makes her feel she has to lie about herself and her past the argument states that it is men who force women to feel like they have to lie it completely absolves responsibility from women because apparently men instill this feeling to lie in women and women must act on any and all emotions whether the woman wants or doesnt want a man like this it is still the man who causes her to lie and lets not forget the it doesnt make sense to me escape clause oh sure there is no implication about men being to blame the statement is just expressing how that particular situation doesnt make sense an honest question would look more like why do women lie in relationships or why do women feel the need to lie to their partners or why does anybody man or woman lie in relationships not why do men cause women to lie that is ridiculous how can women be strong and independent yet simultaneously blame everyone but themselves for their actions furthermore im attacking her idea with logic while you are attacking the way in which i put forth my argument just because someone is abrasive doesnt mean they are wrong or have nothing of worth to contribute regardless in a debate people attack what other people say thats how debates work if you are debating and you rationally think the other person is being dishonest you are supposed to say so but thats the thing the average woman cant debate ideas so instead she tone polices in an attempt to derail the conversation and make it about the individual and that is the ultimate irony here you are criticizing me for making things personal but that is in fact what you are doing you are ignoring the issue at hand and instead saying i need to be a certain way in order to speak i need to be civil but what does that mean exactly it seems like being civil here means not calling a woman out on their bullshit because i very much doubt you would have reprimanded me if i was debating a guy its just like the terms racism and sexism these days they mean whatever the person using them wants them to mean so in effect they have lost all meaning same with gender rape social justus and whole host of other words if people have to change the meanings of words or make up words like mansplain to make their point then they have already lost the argument because said argument is not rooted in rational thought instead the debate becomes a useless exercise in using arbitrary feelings to justify acting like a child
PurplePillDebate,removed,for someone whos antiblabbing youre sure flapping your gums about shit that has nothing to do with this post but keep fapping to your revenge fantasies of rapefugees
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre so full of shit as if the most alpha man still cant be swayed by hard to get if you are in a ltr stop trying so hard to pretend you man is so alpha
PurplePillDebate,removed,that surrender hahayoure no stranger to personal attacks
PurplePillDebate,removed,there were some awesome people who refused to let me become a statistic fuckers
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol at women claiming they cant remember
PurplePillDebate,removed,heres what a man who is honest with himself thinks id rather teach her from the ground up no need for her to go through a meat grinder of dicks shes so helpless so trusting and her standards are so low thank god she has no idea how insecure i utruthuncensored really am or how overreactive my gag reflex is whatever other dicks touch is contaminated they have jizz cooties just helping you live up to your username meanwhile i dont want to train a clueless virgin i want to learn i want to find a coconspirator your masturbatory fantasies are a complete turnoff
PurplePillDebate,removed,who cares
PurplePillDebate,removed,i didnt know they kept stats on beastiality
PurplePillDebate,removed,it just screams low self esteem doesnt it
PurplePillDebate,removed,riiiight i thought it was acknowledged that the patriarchy has historically restricted womens sexuality isnt that what we hear about allll the time why would we do that if men dont care at times its patently ridiculous sometimes debating on here with people that dont cop to the most basic premise laughable really frankly youre outright delusional if you think men dont want chaste women or that men are actively looking for exsluts to wife up delusional
PurplePillDebate,removed,the fuck you say women would never lie bro whats your problem man you insecure or something s i think over time whats going on becomes pretty obvious to the casual observer
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah if you can only get a date via tinder
PurplePillDebate,removed,and the church said amen
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont cut yourself on that edge bro
PurplePillDebate,removed,true and by that logic trp is also an overblown reaction to feminism and the real world i guess everyone on ppd is a child
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are all womens comments so bad on this r it distressing that we see women so easily able to manipulate men and now were seeing it even on this forum anyone who has been reading ppd for the past few days knows who i specifically mean by all women these women post lazy comments that are sometimes only five words or less ending with lol they give zero effort to write something interestingunique or even to just explain their honest feelings despite this they are able convince the men on this forum to project an attractive aura onto them causing us to give them a lot of attention that will never be returned what would it be like to be a woman in this era it bizarre to attempt contemplate their experience i am unable to and they have no interest of actually expressing themselves in a coherently concrete way
PurplePillDebate,removed,i see you are all decked out in shinny white armor ready to defend mladys honor you really have this fantasy image in your heard where rape victims are these poor damsels in distress that did everything right and then bam suddenly their best friend that they trust completly and has been nothing but nice to her ripps his mask off rapes her and reveals how he has been stalking her and planning this all along like a true serial killer most people getting raped were doing high risk behaviour that is also at a high risk for many other things like death for example also the data gets skewd by many things that are not rape rather unconfortable or regretfull situation getting called rape
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah the analogy breaks down when you cant say dont leave your doors unlocked if you dont wanna get robbed dont walk around a shitty neighborhood with your wallet out and it really looks more like dont give your friend you trust a key he might rob you or dont ask your friend to hold your wallet for a moment he might take all your money out of it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean you guys are white in skin only genetically though ashkenazis are just as close to shitskins north africans and levantines as they are central europeans
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you serious this whole conversation is about someone citing trp as a source thats the data im talking about and im just going to have to say i think youre wrong and leave it at that i believe they are very much the same and i really dont care enough to have a debate about it or hear someone trying to back up either of these disgusting groups sorry
PurplePillDebate,removed,sorry mate
PurplePillDebate,removed,and
PurplePillDebate,removed,what a completely moronic statement id probably attempt suicide by cop in the courtroom
PurplePillDebate,removed,it works by separating observations about the world and personal emotions hard to understand i know when you only have the latter
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill argue using a strawman deal with it finding enjoyment from life outside of the pursuit of women it says its about sexual strategy as in you know having sex maybe with women maybe with men maybe with etc
PurplePillDebate,removed,excuses excuses

PurplePillDebate,removed,amen to that
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree amen
PurplePillDebate,removed,no shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have no idea what part of my post is circlejerking or uncivilised i agree with everything ukrispymcsockington said and explained why i agree with it i also have no idea why you single out what i said as being uncivilised when the op of this comment chain said implementing redpill is the automatic equivalent of homocideviolation of road rulestheft and you said nothing they say in a different thread that someone cannot have a rational part in their own brain if they agree with any part of trp philosophy and you say nothing they are arguing that the fact that several trp actions are widely considered immoral vague at best should prevent people from using those actions as if somehow their immorality is automatically a sign of their defectiveness time and time again morality gets in the way of a proper discussion of conflicting philosophies which is what i thought this sub was about i was clearly mistaken
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,so true about time a woman here said this
PurplePillDebate,removed,your comment is complete bullshit i think women here are tired of reading this kind of trash
PurplePillDebate,removed,this isnt an attempt to change your view im just offering a womans perspective to the debate any man who would be satisfied with a sex bot over a real human female is not someone who i would want to date anyway if anything it removes people from the dating people who want me to lie there silently while they use me for their pleasure there are already too many of these men out there trust me i have slept with a few of them if something helps these men get off so i dont have to be the target of their loneliness and sexual frustration it is actually a good thing for me i do not believe for a second that sex bots would ever become so popular as to seriously affect any womans likelihood to find a partner if anything it will equalize the dating pool by providing sexually frustrated men with an alternative and likely better form of masturbation i imagine the type of men who would prefer a sex bot over a real woman are the type of men who creep out andor hurt women anyway please sex bots take them off our hands we dont want em this would be great
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe you should talk to some actual women someday
PurplePillDebate,removed,we should just chain women up and put them in cages then take them out when its time for rape the majority would like it anyhow seeing as so many of them have rape fantasies i guess they understand theyre only good for their disgusting holes
PurplePillDebate,removed,tl dr darwin dna evolution its not womens fault they are hard wired to reject the bottom of males
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol i triggered all the cat ladies xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,rap music is also to blame lolololol fuck are you or jfc mods pls make qw flair blames rap music with a blue color
PurplePillDebate,removed,do we really need a post to explain why women like strong attractive in shape and outgoing men
PurplePillDebate,removed,thanks for sharing youre a special snowflake
PurplePillDebate,removed,men are attracted very much to stacy chads female counterpart
PurplePillDebate,removed,my mind is blown by this stunning revelation i have seen the light holy f jfc this is a quality post really
PurplePillDebate,removed,it may be anecdotal but i see more and more women who have simply opted out of dating and marriage because they see it isnt worth it good lol id much rather than subprime unwanted postwall hags go die in a corner quietly than infect the smp any further year old washed up exsluts are a terrible influence on other women they have nothing to lose so they slut it up with abandon they are unable to maintain relationships with men so they hate men with abandon younger untainted women are unfortunately easily influenced by watching these old sluts in action if the sluts just go and die off far away from the cock carousel they wont be able to set a terrible example for all other women more importantly they wont be exploiting beta males for their resources in exchange for tepid infrequent sex its a win win
PurplePillDebate,removed,violent its the natural order of things no more violent than a predator eating another animal
PurplePillDebate,removed,aw do you crave a more controversial post babe hang on let me pound out one on how all women secretly crave being raped
PurplePillDebate,removed,as stupid as this thread is this is a no downvote subreddit and id thank you all to respect that
PurplePillDebate,removed,please speak english
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre ok in my book bro nothing gay about getting your dick sucked even if the person doing it is some queer its only ever gay if they penetrate you
PurplePillDebate,removed,everything you said was emotional and irrational further proving my point
PurplePillDebate,removed,im a decent human beings and i get a lot of girls its easy
PurplePillDebate,removed,how exactly is it a problem men uniting to discuss how they can behave in such a way that pleases women enough for them to want to fuck them available alternative are rape celibacy which would you prefer
PurplePillDebate,removed,shove it
PurplePillDebate,removed,im going to go with symptom ive watched many female friends toy with socalled betas at bars and in social settings only to ditch them for an alpha as soon as he brushes his boner past her butt at the bar i dont blame them as ive also upped the quality of the target midstream but i think i did this much less often than my female friends this leaves a bunch of men hanging out to dry and looking for ways to be the alpha or at least the one that the girls go home with also as much as blue pillers dont like to admit this these little games work sex is like money people always want more of it some people attend trump university as a symptom of wanting to be rich others read trp though i would venture to guess that trp is more successful than trump u
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not pretending anything but i dont get why you think asking someone please speak english when they send a message as cryptic as terpers dont like it when the shoes on the other foot can rate as uncivil im not a trp as the flair makes clear and i have made constructive contributions to this discussion which is more than can be said of ulerellens comment which makes literally no sense in the context of the thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,a throat hug maybe
PurplePillDebate,removed,hahaha
PurplePillDebate,removed,so this is griddy treating this like its her blog huh
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah working to improve yourself is totally entitled that makes sense you feminists need to come up with some new buzzwords
PurplePillDebate,removed,an echo chamber
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp is a self improvementdating advice forum thats why they say just lift bro all the time i just assumed youre a feminist because you seem to be suffering from the symptoms i mentioned earlier
PurplePillDebate,removed,im vaguely surprised this reply was so well thought out
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah women actually commit just as much if not more violent crime compared to men its just that women have such an easy time in the justice system that they rarely get convicted men have a higher chance of being convicted of a crime and are much more likely to be charged in the first place since the stats on violent crime only take convicted criminals into account women are underrepresented because they get off scot free extremely often also youre wrong about women suffering the majority of violence men suffer far more violence than women and are much more likely to be the target of any violent attack
PurplePillDebate,removed,its caused by the atomisation of society people lacking social circles have piss poor social status by default and that sort of things hamper male ability to get laid those people always existed but urbanisation and internet tend to increase atomisation so more and more people fall trought the cracks the feminisation of society doesnt help cause women are more socially based than men and so malajusted men feel the alienation even harder
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is a vague nonanswer this could be the generic answer to any question about anything
PurplePillDebate,removed,interesting reply but unfortunately not this time
PurplePillDebate,removed,its interesting that blues refer to fiction for rpbp archetypes when rpers have done the same use fictional narratives or characters to illustrate trp concepts blues yell thats fiction thats not real thats a figment of your imagination
PurplePillDebate,removed,cope harder try not to kill yourself as you cry tonight
PurplePillDebate,removed,you must have been really sheltered if you never heard men and women yelling at each other ect
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats nice dear and kind of irrelevant to the topic at hand we were discussing what value positive or negative men bring to the table if youd like to complain and brag about failing with women in your own country trp is that way
PurplePillDebate,removed,and youre proving my point being the irresponsible bad boy who gets tons of sex is far better than being a sucker aka the bare minimum of having a job and being a decent person you are also very confused its women who ultimately lose the wailing of these future cat ladies is delicious trp and other manosphere sites are just accelerating the process that is what you have an issue with
PurplePillDebate,removed,symptom
PurplePillDebate,removed,if its a hot guy i doubt you can tell the difference in the heat of the moment most women cant
PurplePillDebate,removed,next
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes i understand that it was intended to be a hate fueled mockery of trp
PurplePillDebate,removed,how arrogant no a collection of outofcontext comments on a multitude of topics many of which are obvious sarcasmjokes does not constitute a mic drop use your words this is a debate forum
PurplePillDebate,removed,everyone has the potential to be awful imagine a society in which men can do no wrong in any dispute people automatically favored men men could hit and insult women without fear of retaliation men demanded all the responsibility they could get while absolving themselves of any blame for the outcomes of their behavior youd see men start to act pretty badly pretty quickly being awful is largely a function of never having boundaries set on your behavior this isnt a gender issue its a parentinglegal system issue so yes women on average are pretty awful these days because they can be it takes willpower to control your own impulses people only acquire this ability if theyre made to society right now is organized around pampering and pandering to women hence theyve never had to learn to control themselves and many of them act very badly
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont argue with archwinger hes a complete shill for rp and basically hates women youre not going to get anywhere
PurplePillDebate,removed,can confirm i totally attract and settle for the wrong women my fault too i actually spend much time trying to figure out why after speaking with friends and family it turns out that im lazy ive almost never asked a girl out i simply wait around until they ask me out and these aggressive girls may possible not be of the highest quality but then maybe its for the best i probably wouldnt be good for a nice girl
PurplePillDebate,removed,i read tbp several times a day i dont post there because its not my space the rest of what you wrote is unrelated gobbledygook
PurplePillDebate,removed,why dont you tell me what you think it is and then we can discuss whether or not its ethical i dont know what im talking about but its popular to hate it so i go along with the crowd whats surprising to me isnt that blue pillers hate trp hate is easy to manufacture and trp uses coarse language thats easy to criticize especially out of context what really gets me is that people whove spend so much time hating trp still dont have a decent grasp on even the subs most prominent ideas how can you discuss a topic so frequently and not even learn a little bit here and there
PurplePillDebate,removed,i still really dont understand why women are so upset with the negative opinions certain trps or mgtows have on women when women on the extreme side of feminism have been just as bad or even worse twoards men for decades now
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah youre a shitty person you can worry about being the best you can be without worrying about whether or not you measure up to others competing with yourself is a tactic that secure successful people have been using for aeons my desire to achieve and to be the best or make money or whatever isnt driven by fear if i stopped working tomorrow and moved back in with my parents theyd probably just provide for me forever and then id inherit their propertiesassets and be all set eventually my desire to achieve is rooted in pride and ambition generally speaking no dread does not doesnt mean a relationship is shitty
PurplePillDebate,removed,no you are not shitty because you believe in the smp you are shitty because youre actively manipulative due to your insecurities
PurplePillDebate,removed,totally no man hate or blatant misandry in tbp or srs right just good old fashion satire right they so dont encourage hate and violence against men right no delusions in the femmepire subs right gtfo hypocrite xox
PurplePillDebate,removed,because you obviously didnt read what i wrote here it is again claiming someone tr to change everything they encounter into an rp thing based on their posts on red pill forums is like claiming someone thinks everything is about baseball based on their posts on rbaseball
PurplePillDebate,removed,prove it
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is not trp talking this is uatlasbshruggin talking about my personal treatment at the hands of tbp youre reactions are inappropriate and insane
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is within has very little to do with who you attract and dont attract not everyone has total control over how they look
PurplePillDebate,removed,virginal queen of seduction would be an amazing flair
PurplePillDebate,removed,annnnnd that hits the point right home
PurplePillDebate,removed,op talks about how a girl and a guy who dont know each other and arent in a relationship with each other or anyone else have casual sex and the girl could see it as just sex kyle proceeds to get triggered and has to bring breaking a relationship rule into the whole scenario hahaha oh typical kyle you love to get triggered dont ya
PurplePillDebate,removed,if the man has formed a relationship with the child andor has provided material support to the child for an undefined period of time you could be ordered to pay child support more importantly most importantly for the two clients that we have paying women who are also receiving additional monthly funds for the same child from a different man the cases are being heard in tribal court
PurplePillDebate,removed,so by the same token if you didnt like my response because you felt it was pandering why not just downvote it and not comment in the first place what club are you desperately trying to belong to oh yeah edgelords for
PurplePillDebate,removed,ah i mistook your post about the marginal cases of psychotic women who likely have chromosomal abnormalities or brain damage and think they are men and hence fantasize about raping others and the universal propensity of women to fantasize about being raped my mistake enjoy the pegging sessions
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol all men are rapists or at least potential rapists to get a rapist just add a drink to a man i feel sorry for your hypothetical son having you as a parent is really going to mess him up he will be on rtheredpill before he turns you man hating is too obvious try a little subtlety
PurplePillDebate,removed,just because your younger self failed to achieve it doesnt mean we all did
PurplePillDebate,removed,doesnt mean he wants to fuck you
PurplePillDebate,removed,no im sure theyre way more heteosexual than the rest of the population you should reassure them its okay to enjoy themselves if anything touches their prostate
PurplePillDebate,removed,either participate or stfu
PurplePillDebate,removed,ehhh stfu go to trp stop whining ive never been the type to sit and baby anybody
PurplePillDebate,removed,a psychological breakdown yes i have to break down psych cases like you every day you just dont have anyone in your life to tell you when youre wrong its okay i understand the internet is a tough a scary place for people like you who were coddled their entire lives what youre talking about is sex toys what we just witnessed was a man putting his dick in an automobile in public there is no money there as i said many times before only you seem to misunderstand the importance of that fact i just cant make you understand and its a shame because you seem to at least be interested
PurplePillDebate,removed,ye
PurplePillDebate,removed,thank you this entitled shit here
PurplePillDebate,removed,ooh i hope i never find you in real life you probably dont even know what a clitoris is
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes even some feminists recognise this httpwwwalternetorgsexamprelationshipswhydowepunishmenexpressingtheirsexualdesires title
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a woman i dont expect you to ever care about men in any way whatsoever
PurplePillDebate,removed,trying your usual dishonest tactics i see
PurplePillDebate,removed,who the fuck talked to you go back to your thread where you said you cant find any men to have sex with
PurplePillDebate,removed,only you could call this drivel logic
PurplePillDebate,removed,no youve simply proved my point bpers often do this for me yes this confirms it we dont need to look any further thank you uhhh no i was addressing this question you had asked you gave it up right here how can it be questionable if they dont have a duty to other people there is only the law and if its not illegal the individualist wouldnt see any moral transgressions here i answered your question by stating one of the questionable strategies rp advocates for tell me didnt you state that there is only law i believe i explicitly stated that emotional abuse is illegal therefore it is questionable because they have a legal duty to other people around them what point of yours am i proving by answering this question seriously how is stating that one of the things trp advocates for is illegal proving your point please explain id love to know great strawman it wasnt a strawman i was just stating my own preference if it were a strawman then i would have to be stating an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponents argument while actually refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent i was not attempting to refute anything therefore it is not a strawman argument it is simply a statement of my opinion its more narrow because of the nature of collectivism it necessitates ideological uniformity to work this is shown if you clicked the links k fam id odd that you continue to try and argue while simultaneously only proving my point well i did kinda concede did you not notice when i said then i suppose i was wrong then i had already conceded and came to the same conclusion i was just asking that last question to clarify one little thing that was nagging me in the back of my mind congrats bro you won the debate a little tip you dont have to act so high and mighty and rub it in my face when you win a debate then i suppose i was wrong then ok glad i was able to get my point across in a rational and factual manner you literally could have just quoted the part where i said i conceded and left it at that but naaaawwww son you gotta find a knife and try to wound the person whom you debated with so you can watch them rageget upset while you jerk yourself off as you celebrate a victory on the internet no youve simply proved my point bpers often do this for me yes this confirms it we dont need to look any further thank you id odd that you continue to try and argue while simultaneously only proving my point holy massiveegoandlikestobragalotpersonalitytype batman seriously man get off of your high horse its the internet
PurplePillDebate,removed,yep it just makes sense until then to have them pony up years worth of financial support for a child that is not even theirs i am hoping that you arent the smartest one in your group
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats not propaganda you maniac its quotes taken directly from rincel
PurplePillDebate,removed,women live for validation and attention so ofcourse they would welcome it doing this is problematic though see my flair just today i had a cute blonde smile as she passed me and i didnt do anything so what youre not supposed to do anything but smile back she is essentially doing nothing do you just want to be left alone when at the store dont worry about what they want buddy because they sure as hell arent concerned with what you want
PurplePillDebate,removed,they dont like you bruh
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont get salty legbeard if you cant find a suitable guy without effort then youre probably not smart or beautiful you probably repel guys even fat lards nowadays can find a decently attractive desperate guy to screw if you cant even manage that in a world where men are desperate for sex then you suck ass as a sexual prospect why dont you work on your body and attitude instead of blaming other people for your problems
PurplePillDebate,removed,great post completely savaged them all look at how salty they getting they dont have a platform to argue from
PurplePillDebate,removed,what do i mean by non feminist are you serious stop with the questions if youre unintelligent enough to not understand my concepts but intelligent enough to know quality when you see it then thats on you either add to the discussion or dont say anything at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,believe it or not not everyone is trying to bait you you gave me a bullshit condescending ad hominem and just plain fucking rude answer ahahah i love you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i made a thread once along similar lines op i think i suggested bpers are sexnegative in regards to male sexuality they denied it happened
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do think feminism needs to keep going until women have fair and equal representation at all levels of government and positions of leadership thats nonnegotiable women are half the population and they need equal representation and not just women but women of colour and diverse women because people even with the best of intentions have blinders we need diversity for all the things were missing i dont agree that feminism is a sexual strategy theyve got that wrong its only partly true feminism benefits everyone including children its a strategy that wants to see everyone have choices and rights still plugged in
PurplePillDebate,removed,please stop being weird
PurplePillDebate,removed,gee thanks for letting everyone know you wont be around it was so important for you to announce your departure well make sure to plan for that and well all muddle through somehow without you
PurplePillDebate,removed,please stop being weird
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre an idiot women dont have a sex drive unless theyre near an alpha male what fucking planet do you live on
PurplePillDebate,removed,the hell would you know about women
PurplePillDebate,removed,i said typically not everyone is a special snowflake like you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont understand your point its still effort which is what this thread is basically debating you sound a little neckbeardy most women can look like men too with makeup and a wig because heavy labored makeup rather than regular makeup is transformative
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you think men raping comes from being unable to control their urges but women prostituting and divorce raping to cause a mans suicide doesnt then you need psychiatric help with a really skilled specialist
PurplePillDebate,removed,start my own company failing that take up arms and kill my oppressors what i certainly wouldnt do is sit there whining about how i deserve a fair shake nah im not the type to cry for handouts or a leg up which is probably why me and fellow white men have so much stuff and are so historically and presently dominant we likedo stuff we dont just sit there waiting for someone else to give it to us
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp inc
PurplePillDebate,removed,im guessing he has an active alt because who the fuck would come back to reddit to correct someone on a tiny sub because their friend pmed them sometimes it feels like trp is just iterations of the same person
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is so so much more than not being fat hair she must have an abundance on the head and it must look amazing at all times and in all weather with no greys but not a scrap is allowed anywhere else on her body
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not that they cant read its that they can only see the spaces around the words instead of the words themselves
PurplePillDebate,removed,is ideal for marriage if going into marriage as virgins is desired historically accurate for the most part now if the fact that i say that to my knowledge yo has been the age that girls historically wed is somehow making me into a pedo i would love to see the mental gymnastics on that one its ok though youre probably one of those jews that loves palestine
PurplePillDebate,removed,another thread when its bad women do it when its good men do it where did i pass judgement people do this both genders i literally wrote that they do however they do not do it equally often this should just be a post at this point because everyone knows women cant read or comprehend words youre such a misogynist
PurplePillDebate,removed,since my redpill journey began years ago i have been approached by more women than in the previous years i have had times as many offers for women to be affair partners in the time my wife and i have sex somewhere between and times as often as we used to something is working and it wasnt me being bluepill
PurplePillDebate,removed,because hes trash
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a bitter man and i feel sorry for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,my mums far too incredible of a woman to fall into that trap shes basically a walking example of why that sub is bullshit if anything its far more sad that you terpers have obviously never experienced a female role model in your lives
PurplePillDebate,removed,you seriously very clearly have some sort of disorder please do get tested
PurplePillDebate,removed,op confirmed manlet suicide recommended
PurplePillDebate,removed,am man would feel strong dread if i ever got in a relationship my partner could find another man with a snap of her fingers while i might never again have a romantic relationship
PurplePillDebate,removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of the phrase hedgehogs dilemma refers to the notion that the closer two beings come to one another in a relationship the more likely it might be for them to inflict psychological pain on each other yet if they remain apart they each might feel the roughlyequivalent psychological pain of loneliness this notion comes from the conjecture that hedgehogs with sharp spines on their backs might hurt each other if they get too close it is a character trait believed to be possessed by some individuals in real life as well as in works of fiction sometimes causing antisocial behaviours often allegedly caused by an unpleasant past experience of intimate relationships a person who suffers from the hedgehogs dilemma will usually avoid becoming too close or involved with someone due to fear of another similar possibly painful experience such as they had experienced in the past porcupines are a better example of the hedgehogs dilemma due to their commonly known dangerously sharp spines as you can imagine getting too close to them will provoke them and might force a few spines in you in self defense httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol if youve read them youd know most have it
PurplePillDebate,removed,so in opposition to pua theory it seems like women and men in the healthiest romantic relationships wouldnt feel dread or fear that their partner is going to cheat or leave them because they understand each other and do not engage in behaviors which would eventually cause that fear no one on trp is suggesting that a happy relationship should involve terrorizing your partner into thinking youll abandon them on a whim in a happy relationship passive dread is just being attractive enough in terms of physique personality and statusmoney that your partner knows you could find someone else without much trouble because if you can find someone else without much trouble youre a catch and if youre a catch theyll want to keep you happy the term dread comes from how the concept applies in an unhappy relationship one where the woman has no respect for the man and feels like she can do whatever she wants no matter how damaging to the man and hell still cling to her for want of other options in that situation you do need her to become afraid of losing you because she hasnt even considered the possibility of you leaving in a long time and yes fear is the right word if she knows you might leave and is fine with it you obviously havent improved yourself enough youre not a catch the idea is to be desirable so that when shes presented with the fear of a desirable partner leaving shell be open to significant adjustments to the relationship to make it more equitable for the man
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not purposeful that would be a covert contract a man is simply persuing his own abundance since his girl isnt the source he looks elsewhere and if she continues to be a cold cunt he will most likely kick her to the curb and persue his options the feelings is all on her man wants happiness her only decision is if its with her or another girl
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know my so feels it and she expresses as jealousy but she also knows its partly due to the fact that im considered by a lot of her friends as a good guy because ive stayed committed and loyal for so long
PurplePillDebate,removed,its probably just because most poly chicks are half dykes who want triple penetration
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok but does making it sound so sinister actually help or hurt these men i thought i was pretty heavy with the implication that its not sinister and you just have a weak stomach
PurplePillDebate,removed,your replacements are lame dont ever go into marketing
PurplePillDebate,removed,god youre creepy
PurplePillDebate,removed,be the top of your potential crap like this post allows people to blame the world for their lack of grit
PurplePillDebate,removed,talk like a child get treated like one

PurplePillDebate,removed,youre just too wonderful to fool with our parlor tricks hun
PurplePillDebate,removed,men who are with attractive women dont have reasons to cheat and women who are with alphas dont have a need to cheat its the average and below average people that cheat on their partners every chance they get lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,test
PurplePillDebate,removed,shitpost
PurplePillDebate,removed,how is your manhate you sound like the newbie sooks in trp when they are talking about women lol women are happier with a supportive spouse that values her because she is getting money stability and can do what she likes he is happy cause he is too stupid to realise she is schtuping the pool boy and yes these relationships wherr the man falls onto the altar of yes dear anything you want is the where deadbedrooms come from
PurplePillDebate,removed,i read through your opinion of someone elses opinion which drove you to type the man hating dribble that is the op if i was in a more financial position id probably offer to pay for therapy for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,read the anger in what you type nearly every post is borderline misandrist rage any excuse to have another chop at anything remotely male and you hide behind the srs and tbp mantra of its just satire trp says awalt yes but they dont hate women they hate what some women do bloopers like yourself hate men period
PurplePillDebate,removed,blue pill theory summed up in other words thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,im a dude who understands that looks fade and an artist whos aware that theres more than one aesthetic for beauty regardless of what those who get their life plan from commercials think oh so thats why you dont have a beautiful girlfriend im also aware that those who chose a relationship based on beauty over character while advocating passive dread game are only sabotaging their happiness you just quoted a study that said that couple were happier when the wife was beautiful its no wonder why team blue is much happier overall hahaha after i turned my marriage red im much happier and all the shit that my friends complain about in their marriages is gone shes a sweet submissive kinky fitness freak which is certainly not the standard for a mid wife with children
PurplePillDebate,removed,all his posts sound like circle jerking might be better off in tbp than here
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre right that was mean

PurplePillDebate,removed,many men dont want year old women who have taken dicks to men n count matters
PurplePillDebate,removed,i as what youre saying is true you bring facts into the equation you reason forcefully your conclusion seems entirely merited yet i find the conclusion unpleasant because i dont want to face the facts about human nature so ill just downvote you without replying im terribly sorry about that s

PurplePillDebate,removed,that was a rumour they didnt break up and how is it sad he is the worlds sexiest man who happens to be genetics surely it makes sense for him to date younger girls as women his age are clearly nowhere near as good looking
PurplePillDebate,removed,for people who dont like anecdotes you all sure do get preachy when it comes time to deal with real social issues
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are so delusional it actually makes me feel unwell see this is why trpers get accused of being part of rape culture you convince yourself that the heap of evidence in front of you isnt real lets just entertain your bullshit notion for a second lets first of all assume like you said that this woman agreed to have sex with a guy she hadnt met before or even spoke to at this party behind a dumpster she had abrasions on her body pine needles in her hair and dirt in her vagina her necklace was wrapped around her neck dress hiked up above her shoulders all consistent with a girl having a good time in your mind i weep for any unfortunate girlfriend you may have but i digress this isnt just about the unlikely hood of any woman giving consent to be roughly fingered on the dirty ground behind a dumpster this is about the evidence it was rape lucky for us there were two witnesses when the two bicyclists found her she wasnt moving at all clearly unable to give consent but brock was though he was rubbing himself against her unconscious body sober enough to run away too his first instinct was to run not to help the woman who had hurt herself and was lying with her genitals exposed on the ground if you think that a person who is so drunk they are falling over behind a dumpster can give consent you are wrong if you think that it is okay to have sex with a person after they pass out you are wrong this is rape plain and simple and of his peers convicted him of it because they arent oblivious to evidence hell pretty much anyone who has heard of the story who has read the evidence agrees that hes a rapist but not you so all i can say is this seek help learn to recognise consent before you ruin someones life if you dont and youre really unlucky maybe youll be convicted of rape even then im sure youd think it was someone elses fault
PurplePillDebate,removed,but the things he cant do and women can ie getting sex easier better pickings but that he wants to do are examples of female privilege but in calling out this privilege he totally ignores the downsides that come with it in my view that constitutes a lack of empathy because they cannot look past their own perspective at all fucking ridiculous she can just get fat or burn off her face if getting sexual attention so horrible nobody does this because being wanted is much better than being alone
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol redscum defending rapists not surprised
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think his crime deserved any more she was probably a whore anyway

PurplePillDebate,removed,strings a bunch of latin words together something something fallacy these arent exceptions if you see them a lot they just want to pretend its rare because they need more excuses
PurplePillDebate,removed,no i dont buy the alphabeta bullshit i never called him a beta i just said that hes paying all of his wives at the same time and im sorry one of the most powerful men on earth what actual power does he have he owns some buildings and golf courses thats hardly power what exactly can he do with the power leaders have power hes a brilliant marketer and mediocre businessman he has no real power its adorable you think he does though
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is straight out of their holy book muhammad was all about that masturbation is banned africans will rape babies to cure aids on the say so of their witch doctors i dont think many of these men are attracted to these girls more likely that they are the available holes and their religion encourages it and treats women as property so no harm is done in their mind
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is my political affiliation if i dont even believe in democracy because why in the hell should my mongoloid neighbors have a say in anything i want to say libertarian because i feel like my personal liberties and pursuit of happiness are being heavily curbed
PurplePillDebate,removed,top kek
PurplePillDebate,removed,im guessing your a woman because it feels like im arguing with a teenager
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes a dumb shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,whats the site
PurplePillDebate,removed,true are these the same people that claim that its impossible to know the system
PurplePillDebate,removed,so it breaks their disneyesque narrative thats what i thought too what i dont understand is how trp breaks that narrative for them just going outside does it for me
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre absolutely right theres a long list of other reasons why so many people have this distaste but this is definitely one of the main reasons nobody wants to feel like they are predictable and easily manipulated i agree with most of trp however i still dont like knowing what i know i just wanna fall in love mannn it feels so good i dont think i ever will again though i feel like i know too much bliss is out of the question
PurplePillDebate,removed,you one paranoid motherfucker dude
PurplePillDebate,removed,women dont like to think of themselves as robots its kinda true tho
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre right when i talk to my not xntx husband these are his main criticisms following how pathetic these men are
PurplePillDebate,removed,your post just confirms how stupid you are and you practically admit yourself that women are stupid hating women for something they have no control over i dont hate women and youre stupid if you think that women have no control over who they are attracted to but i dont why i even bothered replying to you youre either a stupid and ignorant cnt or a troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,while that still seems like a bunch of faggy twits to me tony robbins would be able to defend his methods red pillers dont seem like they can
PurplePillDebate,removed,can women even do anything about their overly emotional and manipulative ways while super masculine men might not be all that common now a days ive yet to meet a woman whos not an overly emotional cry baby its like they cant help it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont see why antifeminists deny it prolly cuz most trpers arent the chads who were pumping and dumping sluts cat calling being casually sexist sharing their exs nudes and beating up homosexuals to prove their macho dominance trp was the friendzoned beta who had to hear about why are men such pigs from fannie feminist when shes in between fucking chads
PurplePillDebate,removed,probably yes but they maintain its always the patriarchys fault because women have no real agency they are just children incapable of personal responsibility
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh please you were trying to tell me about real men tm and i politely told you to gtfo
PurplePillDebate,removed,insecurity aint sexy you asked for his honest feelings and he gave it grow a pair
PurplePillDebate,removed,it means that she has you pegged as a backup guy a beta or she wants to vet you for that in one sense its a shit test to see if youre such a weakling that youll get in the friend zone a test you pass by sexualizing the relationship as quickly as possible either this creates a sexual relationship or ruins her plan to turn you into an orbiter a win either way in another sense its a grievous insult to you as a man so it may be tempting to spit in the girls face but dont do that just ignore her and make a move any sex you wait for is going to be bad sex and women decide that they will or will not fuck you within five seconds of meeting you
PurplePillDebate,removed,it means she is evaluating your provider potential if she didnt see you as a potential provider but as an alpha she wouldnt make you wait
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol is this a brainchild or should i say brainfart of the irc
PurplePillDebate,removed,want a shot at the title wish you luck people just remember this is peoples lives here try not to fuck it up because your ego is in the way also just call it blue advice you cant sprinkle a little alpha on life so there will be nothing red in there seriously though dont fuck up someones life to feed your ego
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah fuck their feelings faggots no wonder they need trp they are so butthurt about everything
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol no nice coping mechanism though
PurplePillDebate,removed,its about defining a successful beta because their definition of the term was essentially boring your thoughts are mangled and unclear do you have adhd
PurplePillDebate,removed,reading must be hard for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,no at worst they are silver diggers who want the stable bb admittedly i do buy presents for the and in a complete beta eruption took the on a trip to thailand right before she balked at being committed however in the former case we are talking peanuts compared to the wealthy businessmen who are trying to lock her down and in the latter case it was still just a matter of me showing up in town and she came over and bought me dinner and then slept with me
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,its just true they look like apes facially and they are at the bottom of the status totem pole
PurplePillDebate,removed,average millennial white party girl has seen a wide variety of dicks from all ethnicities
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh my god you cant make that comparison rape is actually traumatic for guys of the time a grill says she was raped she actually wanted it but then decided the guy was ugly and under and regretted it reeeeeeee
PurplePillDebate,removed,ew
PurplePillDebate,removed,he had to pretend you were so he could trpsplain to his imaginary audience of cheering trp fans stupid
PurplePillDebate,removed,a girl lying about her sexual history a guy knowingly marrying a slut i kinda feel like youre insecure about your sexual past so youre projecting your desires onto us telling a guy youve been with dudes is an instant dick shriveler so you wont youll lie about it and if you did tell the truth the only guy who would accept that is a desperate loser im not really in the mood to argue universal truths we all know you arent going around telling guys youve slept with hundreds of dudes so quit the bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,bbut
PurplePillDebate,removed,just make sure you manipulate a white girl into traveling to the middle east with you get a liberal and accuse her of racism and islamaphobia if she resists this way you can trap her there and accomplish your goals without committing miscegenation and race traitoring
PurplePillDebate,removed,well we all know hes not married thats for damn sure s
PurplePillDebate,removed,beat them
PurplePillDebate,removed,getting so offended you resort to psychoanalysis kek

PurplePillDebate,removed,cats
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you saying that female behavior may be modeled as turds in a toilet bowl
PurplePillDebate,removed,who cares women reward this behavior with access to the golden gash if its an illness more jewish psychobabble why do women want to pass this along their genetic line
PurplePillDebate,removed,those grapes are so sour we should call them purple lemons
PurplePillDebate,removed,so im saying the end result was not necessitated by her voicing she doesnt like ripped guys the only people less selfaware than women are other women
PurplePillDebate,removed,bitter alert
PurplePillDebate,removed,surprise womens and mens sexuality ie want of sex or sex drive is already the same the only things holding back most women from going around and blowing chads left and right is criticism slutshaming and safety if you could theoretically take away criticism of female promiscuity especially from other women and make it safe to bang than you have what accounts for a hippie smokeout or swinger party
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are my favorite these are things i have said and thought for a long time but you wrote it out very concisely thank you for this post
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats my issue with the red pill not to mention their bio truths
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol this is the result of when you view relationships from a capitalistic angle this is hilarious
PurplePillDebate,removed,i believe its more due to clash of cultures those immigrants typically come from cultures that dont have a lot of respect for women or hell even other men when you grow up in a shitstorm without a lot of opportunities to thrive or make something of yourself you wind up not having a lot of values and living life with the attitude of only in it for me most of the current influx of immigrants coming into places like sweden come from countries that are voted as the worst for women in the world not that most of the refugees are bad but of course youre going to get people who think its reasonable to treat women as shitty in sweden as back home because back home it wouldnt have been a big deal combine that with the fact that women in places like sweden are a lot more liberated and independent a lot of these men see that as an invite because again they are basing how women should act based on how women act back home so to them a normal swedish woman would appear very brazen and since they have no attachment to them and consider them just as foreign as they themselves are considered its easier for them to justify doing such acts also how do you know that they actually are sexually frustrated why would they be its not like immigrant women arent coming over and its not like their families arent expecting them to datemarry one of their own kind
PurplePillDebate,removed,if this was the case why dont you see every sexually frustrated swedish guy going around raping women
PurplePillDebate,removed,no its because they are backwards uneducated and poor
PurplePillDebate,removed,i didnt realize that there was a war between men and women
PurplePillDebate,removed,middleeastern men cannot compete with white men look at how much sex crimes have been going on in europe if these middleeastern guys cant find women from their own countries to oppress they are going to try and have their way with western women the solution is to either castrate those dudes or send them back to their shit hole of a country
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is ridiculous you might as well say all men who arent well built and with a nice face are more prone to sexual assault
PurplePillDebate,removed,the average scandinavian male is tall well built and has a nice face but utterly lacking in maleness or charm most immigrants coming from other countries just cannot compete with that they arent though i read an increasing amount of native scandinavianit may have been swedish men are marrying foreign brides rather than other native women
PurplePillDebate,removed,well ive told my story previously of the middle eastern refugee who attempted to assault me he had a massive sense of entitlement to my body after only knowing me for two weeks thats the culture he was raised in nothing to do with being sexually undesirable had everything to do with thinking of me as property just like all those other entitled idiots who are not even refugees
PurplePillDebate,removed,thanks and praise the sun
PurplePillDebate,removed,its incredibly useful do nothing close your eyes hope for the best
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really think no kids will suffer because of this policy no one said that fuck you typical leftist debate style mods please ban this shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think they really care
PurplePillDebate,removed,check the upvotes and eat a dick
PurplePillDebate,removed,begone weeaboo degenerate
PurplePillDebate,removed,well this is a nice moment someone found their first case of httpwwwdictionarycombrowsehyperbole today
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats why im for forcing them to do the right thing standard poor as fuck blood sucking nobody you will from now on be mocked for this every time you reply to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,the same rights that people have to do whatever they want also gives everyone else the right to judge them for it this exactly thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,but its okay when i do it
PurplePillDebate,removed,no wait i got this maybe you should consider talking with her or seeing a counsellor i think a chat about how you can remove some of her burdens such as doing more chores so she isnt as tired when she gets home remember shes been working hard all day and needs a break now and then to help get her into a sexy mood while youre at it throw outdelete your porn avert your gaze when a woman who is more attractive than your wife wanders by and maybe ask her how her day was because your really want to hear how that bitch wendy from accounting is still giving her a hard time while sleeping with every guy in the office because shes such a slut with her low cut tops and short skirts anyway when she inevitably mentions chad that tall handsome soontobepromoted stallion who your wife occasionally talks to and hangs out with after work which is why she sometimes comes in late dont be jealous theyre just friends after all and maybe shes turned to him for advice from a male perspective when shes out with him do the dishes and put the kids to bed do not be discouraged when she says shes tired keep at it therapy talking it out and your wifes time with chad will have your relationships right in no time
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think it is a bit humorous taken in the light of the rp words pay attention to actions not words or other similar things people can do pretty much whatever they want but i am free to comment on it and if it in any way affects me then i can act upon it in many cases however its not as judgmental as it appears at first blush hands up who loves sluts they are fun to be around and a good romp in the sack from having so much practice do i want a slut to be the mother of my child no would i introduce her to my mother probably not but then you get the bree olsens of the world whose hamster became road kill because a woman can retcon one relationship but not a thousand porn movies trpillers are judgmental of dysfunctional lifestyles and quite blunt among themselves about what other members are doing wrong but there is no red pill lifestyle per se there is the common formulation of running night game and spinning plates when youre not yknow lifting weights and making six figures in your own small business lots of people have happy relationships hell the majority of people have happy relationships right up until they are no longer happy the difference is that comes as a shock to a blue pill mind especially when they have put half of everything on one spin of the wheel called marriage the red pill mind understands that all good things must come to an end and dont give other people women mostly enough rope so they can hang you with it some people are happy with their choices because they felt they didnt have any trpillers reserve their harshest judgments for those who judge them the sjws and white knights and whatever criticism you make of trp the doxxing and witch hunts that sjws will engage in is pretty much unknown among red pillers
PurplePillDebate,removed,some red pillers are idiots thats all you need to know
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes but only men women deserve no blame ever
PurplePillDebate,removed,may i just submit that girl have small brain
PurplePillDebate,removed,if i might shed some light if it was a girl girl do have small brain
PurplePillDebate,removed,fam
PurplePillDebate,removed,once again you are intentionally missing the point to push an agenda honestly woman fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,eat a dick what i said was a legitimate criticism of her ideas if id said it in a more pc way the message wouldnt have changed her world view involves stealing from anonymous people to better herself this cannot be said in any way that isnt a direct judgement of her character youre attempting to ban people disagreeing with her ideas based on her poor character essentially a thought crime
PurplePillDebate,removed,im only lbs granted im fat can do push ups in minutes and wear a military kit that advertises my elite unit with a shield and lightning bolts on my shoulder and i am with a rare alpha attitude in the us military but despite my average looks only my square jaw tan and perfect teeth save my shy personality and inferiority complex i still bang a ton of usmc and usaf women some married sometimes at once and once with three usmc year olds in panama i would be a creepy guy to them but being in good shape being army special forces and making hazard and language pay plus being a lt make me much more than most mil guys on par witht the cia and fbi hrt warriors i work with in forbidden or hostile territory point is find your advantage i used to be a sad sack and although i really am the military right now i found a way to bang girls a year
PurplePillDebate,removed,field report no i done seen a bigass creature loping through the woods bout feet away from me way hairy with long arms and a large head i approached and tried negging the creature it escalated when it chomped off my foot but i maintained frame and projected amused mastery it got a bit skittish when i moved in closer but then i dread gamed it and totally dominated and then it sucked my balls ive got the teeth marks to prove it
PurplePillDebate,removed,look at how many of them react to having to pay for their own children if women have the option of killing of their own children via abortion and they also have the option of abandoning their children via safe haven laws whats between those options and men wanting to be able to have some sort of opt out clause look at how many of those demand women bend over backwards for them yet get nothing in return not even commitment there are both and flair filters on trp nothing in return nothing at all based on what also plenty of us commit look at how many just look at things they can help and go not my problem look at all the incel men out there that would love to get laid every once in a while and all the evil women that could offer some sympathy pussy but go not my problem elliott rodger wouldnt have been a thing if a few hotties just took one for the team look at all the women that choose to birth the children of shitty men and then they wonder why theyre single before the child is even born troll harder next time
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,and thats fine i like the company i keep and anyone that doesnt like it can eat a bowl of dicks and die judge away
PurplePillDebate,removed,best answer
PurplePillDebate,removed,words have implications and subtext are you too dense to realize it
PurplePillDebate,removed,suppose the one thing that annoys me is how tough and macho a lot of red posers talk right before admitting they are cowards who would not stand up to a felon committing a violent act against a pregnant woman because that sort of white knighting is for suckers or something ive seen where that logic leadsand its gratitude generally the couple unite and turn on the white knight who suddenly finds the girl screaming in his face about how he needs to mind his own business etc once i saw the couple attack the guy and then wander off arm in armso i guess in a way the guy was successful in diffusing the argument
PurplePillDebate,removed,in other words your cynicism is so much you cant even make this work on an individual level i bet if a woman sacrificed for you you wouldnt help her if she was in need
PurplePillDebate,removed,you could also consider not kicking so many puppies in the future so that they dont turn into dangerous dogs you knowjust a thought
PurplePillDebate,removed,you completly missed the point of that post reread it
PurplePillDebate,removed,entitled to what fucking feminist buzzwords irritate the shit out of me
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow youre so entitled
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck sacrifice look at how you respond to customer service employees bending over backwards to help you kicking them in the teeth and never leaving tips then shitposting about it on ppd later i hereby request the mods alter qw flair to read cinderellas ugly stepsister and remove her ability to alter it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was with you til the last part she can get beaten up for all i care why the fuck am i risking my ass for a society that uses me as a wallet
PurplePillDebate,removed,qw my point is that i believe if redpillers were in situation x they would do y rp we wouldnt qw why would you do y whyyyyy
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you pissed you sound like an mgtow
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes its almost like any sacrifice men make is expected while if they ask that a woman make a sacrifice too its misogyny any woman who has ever said things like if he cant handle me at my worst he doesnt deserve me at my best or happy wife happy life doesnt understand that there are sacrifices she may need to make too it is no wonder modern women are entitled and at the same time unhappy theyve been told they dont have to sacrifice anything they can have it all a child a husband a career men were not exactly having a good time nor were they having it all they toiled worked hard died in wars went down with the ship while women and children went first they are still expected to be the security barrier when a criminal breaks in they sacrifice their lives for their women far more than women do for men women dont understand those sorts of sacrifices which is why they come across as entitled because the relationship is supposed to be all about her she would be shocked to discover that her husband was unhappy because she thought everything was going wellfor her at least its why sometimes women complain about trp because it took the focus from her and put it on him any time you suggest she may need to make a sacrifice or even do something for him its misogyny these days relationships benefit women far more sure they could both make sacrifices but why does she have to when she has society telling her its okay that she doesnt and an incentive to take from men without any repercussions such as through divorce some examples of not having to make sacrifices lose weight youre shallow maybe dress sexy once in a while for him youre not only shallow youre dictating what she must wear and how dare you not see her as sexy regardless of what shes wearing more sex shes tired because she has to raise your kids work and cook shes never going to sacrifice one so the others can be done without exhausting her so you better get used to a dead bedroom at least thats the excuse because lets face it you just dont give her the tingles anymore be a stay at home dad good luck getting away with this one youd better be really good looking the best lover shes ever had or have a passive income an unemployed man is a disposable man oh and what have you done for me lately which is pretty much entitlement to the core there is also the custody issue consent laws inherent bias in the legal system that makes it easier for women to get off or serve lighter sentences we still havent figured out who rapes whom when two drunk women have sex that law seems to only apply to heterosexual men and who does the police arrest when two women are beating each other at home tough one how about this one are women willing to sacrifice partying socialising and getting wasted to reduce their vulnerability and reduce the chances of anything bad happen to them or are they passing the responsibility for their personal safety onto men and society if men blamed women in a similar way for example abusing their vulnerabilities and taking their stuff through the legal system their concerns are not taken seriously society just doesnt care how men feel
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you want men who dont mind being treated badly
PurplePillDebate,removed,one word hypergamy
PurplePillDebate,removed,girl have small brain and no invent anything
PurplePillDebate,removed,im afraid that any man who thinks as you do cant have been around or had sex with many women and before you call that virgin shaming it isnt at all i dont see that as a bad thing well as long as you dont think its insulting it be ok your a massive cunt by the way i dont think thats an insult though as cunts are where babies come from
PurplePillDebate,removed,because guys choose to be desperate and can afford to have no standards and women being forced to have higher standards have given them the benefit of being able to pick what did i just read guys choose to be desperate what lol youre a lunatic are you saying sexual desire is a choice youre not very bright are you btw check that misandry feminist scum
PurplePillDebate,removed,look a wild nawalt
PurplePillDebate,removed,and ive actually been reading a lot of posts on rtheredpill i didnt read further therein lies your problem stop that will edit after i finished reading
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think im not who brought the point about men not wanting to look desperate but not looking desperate would actually help you getting sex oh yes you are you started the whole just jerk off and shut the fuck up thing you misandrist no one ever even assumed men have trouble getting sex because they look desperate you did so women are innocent unicorns with only good intentions and men are the perpetrators and are fucking themselves over on a scale of billions of people according to you youre basically saying you cant get laid because you look desperate to like of male population which is like billion people and you say youre not a misanrist if you have problems socializing that is understandable but it has nothing to do with women and im pretty sure there is a lot of people with interesting interests out there it kinda comes with being interests cosmopolitan isnt interesting sorry its pure cancer well if youre a femalecentric misandrist then perhaps indeed all those boring electronics and maths and videogames are weird boring and are for weirdos and creepers right because if you have more things in your head that are not sex you think less in sex that is a pretty easy one by the way notice how you jumped into incredibly farfetched conclusions just to keep bashing on women dude that is not good for you more like you saying some ridiculous bullshit as if you are coming from a position of authority it always amazes me how feminists always think they are in the moral right even when they say things they have no fucking idea of
PurplePillDebate,removed,you complain about feminism and how it has destroyed our world but just the way you view women as not your equals is the exact reason feminism exists in the first place its funny because its because of feminism that trp exists in the first place
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok heres that comment that the moderator deleted because guys choose to be desperate and can afford to have no standards and women being forced to have higher standards have given them the benefit of being able to pick what did i just read guys choose to be desperate what lol youre a lunatic are you saying sexual desire is a choice youre not very bright are you so you said women have an advantage in the sexual marketplace because guys choose to be desperate considering that more than of men are disadvantaged in the sexual marketplace unlike women who can get laid anytime they want you are in fact saying that you cant get laid because you look desperate to like more than of male population now and im positive that of male population in an exaggeration if you think thats the amount of people that cant get laid again where is the misandry there having sex with the people you want to have sex isnt your right you know its not an exaggeration actually almost all men cant get laid without effort if they wished to unlike women the misandry is that you think that men are somehow flawed and are desperate and need to jerk off to porn did it ever occur to you that perhaps men are not inherently evil and flawed maybe its just how it should be maybe there is nothing wrong with wanting sex having sex with the people you want to have sex isnt your right you know oh yes this is the feminist narrative that i see pushed around a lot so youre going with the entitlement path huh now bud can you cite me where i say it is your right to have sex with people you want to have sex with im studing maths at the university my female friends are mostly maths and physicis students our common interests are music films videogames and tv shows i dont know if they buy magazines in their free time i personally dont im sorry that i dont fit in your obviously misogynistic and cliché narrative or that i keep not giving you reasons to call me misandrist but you will have to work with reality oh so youre a nerd that doesnt seem quite right there are no women in stem and the only few women that are there are fetishized by hungry nerds that cant find a woman that can understand them so ping me back when you come back from your imaginationland on planet earth stereotype is not an empty word now i would love you to point what have i said that is at the same time bullshit and comes from any position of authority also if you manage to befriend women with no actual sexual intention you get rid of a big part of the undesired libido fucking what i didnt know maths students also studied sexology and were qualified to give such life advice if you have problems socializing that is understandable but it has nothing to do with women and im pretty sure there is a lot of people with interesting interests out there again apparently you being a feminist automatically makes you an expert on human relations and socializing
PurplePillDebate,removed,no he acknowledged the privilege he just said that the female counterpart has the privilege of not ever stressing about going homeless while a male knows society will leave him to die if he has nothing and argued that he would prefer that youre the idiot straw manning
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah but youre also probably a neckbeard whos never worked a day in his life
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont particularly care if you disagree you really shouldnt be doing a cmv post then can you explain why this shouldnt be removed
PurplePillDebate,removed,not sure if ironicor stupid
PurplePillDebate,removed,its ok you fucked up no ones perfect have another downvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,the reference is how long until you can do this shit yourself and do i actually have to explain that
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats the thing chad only wants ons or fwb doesnt that make it a win win for him ask op hes the one who brought up marriage and relationships and kids as goals for men whos leaving dumb chad is giving up on any kind of real accomplishment because it no longer makes him feel superior to women good go away weed yourself out
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao exactly
PurplePillDebate,removed,theyre frustrated because women arent the stepford wives
PurplePillDebate,removed,ahhh here comes the alt right white supremacist trump supporting white neckbeard gotta have at least one in every thread these days rule of the internet
PurplePillDebate,removed,in difference to other altfascists im well aware that my view of reality may be slightly tainted by jewish manipulation
PurplePillDebate,removed,now theyre going to say wanting men who are good looking is still an expression of hypergamy and then men who are exciting as an expression of hypergamy and then men who are good at sex as an expression of hypergamy hypergamy means everything hypergamy means nothing

PurplePillDebate,removed,the right to walk down a street without the fear of being assaulted because everybody knows men never get assaulted s its quite paradoxical how these strong and independent feminist women are scared pretty much of everything

PurplePillDebate,removed,there are intelligent fifteen year olds who are capable of making an informed rational realistic voting decision but we still dont allow anyone under eighteen to vote because the vast majority of them are completely incapable the same is true of women i mean in europe they overwhelmingly supported bringing in millions of refugees how stupid can you be they overwhelmingly vote with blind emotion or in line with their peers and it lands them in the shit not just them of course the rest of us too i know the idea sounds bizarre to you that your opinion might just be complete shit but its probably true
PurplePillDebate,removed,because youre an emotional and mental wreck obviously why do you think its because of your vagina
PurplePillDebate,removed,people who dont meet expectations get targeted youre obsessed with the idea that women are completely hated and oppressed by society so youll never even consider the idea that unusual unattractive men experience the same sort of thing stop wasting my time with your delirious ideas
PurplePillDebate,removed,some serious psychological dread game depending on how long wed been married and if we had kids i may just skip that and dump her
PurplePillDebate,removed,no you think that you are because just like most feminists you have mental issues and a massive victim complex
PurplePillDebate,removed,break up thats what i did when my male partner did this to me or if that feels too hardline to you try opening the relationship only if theyre okay with that obviously and dont present it as an ultimatum or take a short break from each other i honestly think breaking up is the best option here though and the least emotionally messy unless she genuinely hashad a low libido to begin with its likely that stress or depression is the cause of this sudden lack of desire for sex if so work out whether its short or long term and whether or not youre willing to ride things out this is something my partners all know about me upfront sometimes ill fuck you twenty times a day and freak the shit out of you by pushing your limits in very bizarre freaky ways ah the joys of manic hypersexuality other times i dont want to touch you i can still do maintenance sex if youre okay with that and willing to use lube butyoure going to be able to tell the difference between normal me sex and depressed me sex
PurplePillDebate,removed,notice that there has not been a single answer to your question not one
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have no wish to be a mod but i do appreciate your support i take comfort in the fact that someone who literally thinks my response of because i said so is goading will never achieve any sort of high office or attain any personal success because any such person is not fit to enter the adult world usensen

PurplePillDebate,removed,this is openly stated in that thread that op linked to why do you bother talking to blues they dont listen cant read and like wallowing in shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,why dont you explain why possessing kiddie porn is apparently no big deal and also explain why calling a kiddie porn apologist creepy offends your fee fees
PurplePillDebate,removed,you and op are being disingenuous what youre doing is akin to saying civil rights passed in discrimination is illegal therefore black people have nothing to complain about bullshit low energy posting
PurplePillDebate,removed,core rules no downvoting we ask that you refrain from downvoting ppd is a neutral space but the demographics of the sub shift constantly in order to prevent one side from voting the other side away the mods ask that users refrain from downvoting on ppd
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice dodge are you now on the kiddie porn is no big deal team pem i thought you had a few standards at least
PurplePillDebate,removed,correct me if im misinterpreting anything but i dont think id see any gain in my relationship by following rpwi advice okay then keep it moving what is this gross written display do you want validation for not being an rpw no one is asking or cares amirite about whether strangers are rpws or not rpwi isnt probing the web looking for women to convert this isnt a movement if you like your relationship dynamic and it works then do you but what rpwi advises women works for some and thats more than enough this post is gross and attention whorish
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats not an argument im personally not turned on by something its bad its baaaad i hate it why cant poor people just choose not to be poor i dont understand i hate it i hate things i dont understand
PurplePillDebate,removed,no im downvoting you because youre flip flopping you clearly didnt even read your own post it says dont waste youre time trying to get sex from these bitches they just want a beta bux to take care of them in non redpill speak that means the woman is looking for a relationship seriously read your own post
PurplePillDebate,removed,ha youve edited you original message you said you downvoted him so no point in lying now i always wonder who are these people that think theyre above the rules and downvote now i found one of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not so much about internet points its about certain people like you who go out of their way modify subreddit style to downvoted people even though its against the rules it says a lot when someone of supposedly low moral fiber a redpiller plays by the rules and you do not
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont get to whine is that how you read my disappointment try using less long nasal vowels when you read my words in your head de·hu·man·ize dēˈhyo͞oməˌnīzsubmit verb deprive of positive human qualities there we go im sure that ridiculous oversimplification answers all your burning questions but now im curious what prevents you from registering the information in my previous posts do you have alexithymia
PurplePillDebate,removed,bullshit i do not take a position on who men and women should fuck they are adults pick your own partners you just like to shit on women so you blame them for what is a two person choice and then you compound your hypocrisy by perpetuating a system that creates shitbag guys whose one mission in life is to fuck as many women as they can while creating no marriages sustainable relationships or anything else that benefits society gtfo
PurplePillDebate,removed,because i said so

PurplePillDebate,removed,ugaylubeoil uciswhitemaelstrom
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think that many men are against feminism tbh most men dont even think about it and are totally unaware
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminism is inclusive to high quality high status men every other man gets fucked so when your choose percentage here bottom whatever man isnt getting any benefits from a massive cultural change why would he get on board feminism is literally designed to reduce mens privileges and freedoms framed as improving womens privileges and freedoms which if thats all it was i dont think anyone would have an issue and if youre not going to make that up in some way why would a man ever get on board
PurplePillDebate,removed,well you only think this because as a woman and a human being you personally are trash
PurplePillDebate,removed,and their base goal is to be the best at the lowest cost that actually doesnt work too low and you damage your perceived value clients arent at all objective and are you really going to argue that the market leaders are the best quality its like drawing a beautiful painting on a canvas made of shit if youve suffered serious cognitive impairment come back when youve figured out how to phrase your criticism without the strawman hint youre arguing anything besides generic mainstream music is founded on a base of shit too at the end of the day your job is to compete against everyone around and to prove that your ambition talent careful planning and energy are better than everyone elses no i just need to prove we share the same goals and were better for each other than anyone else theres only so far you can take the market metaphor before you need to expand it to take in the human experience
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh ffs all red pillers claim that awalt that women are hypergamous and selfish most claim that women are inferior to men less moral than men have fucked up sexual natures and are manipulative and deceptive many believe that women are basically children that it is okay for men to cheat that women are worthless except for their vaginas and that rape victims are liars some believe that rape victims all deserved it that you should leave a woman if she was raped that women should not be allowed to vote work or do anything without her father or husbands consent ive come across all of this quite commonly that is misogyny you moron
PurplePillDebate,removed,only cucks marry single motheds kill the kid or next her
PurplePillDebate,removed,this entire debate boils down to this whatchu say bout my momma
PurplePillDebate,removed,because most of them are white knights hellspawn of single mothers who were raised to worship women lol thats why they have no problem dating tiertrash women
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh man there is a classic trp post single mothers are delinquent subhuman scum who you should avoid at all costs such a good post filled with data as well the fact is that single mothers are almost always entirely responsible for their situation they either drove their baby daddy away because they are shit quality ltr material or they are low fto sluts with horrible judgement they ruin childrens lives and single mothers should be seen for what they are child abusers i wish we could take away all their welfare and those bastard children could just die in the street either that or women would have to stop fucking exciting bad boy losers and start bringing something to the table in marriage
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant force anyone to want your vienna sausage
PurplePillDebate,removed,the greater blue pill is about defending degeneracy above all else
PurplePillDebate,removed,so why do red pillers keep acting as if there are isnt it obvious its clearly revenge fantasy these girls are having sex and dating while im not in my teensearly when im i will be george clooneyesque while these women are fat unwanted and regret not dating nice guys like me instead sleeping with chads
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol have i triggered you youre around i see
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah i agree women who sleep around eventually get to have the cake and marry and form a family instead of desiring them ill do your best to not to end with these kind of women as a life partner
PurplePillDebate,removed,you would be a dead lesbian so you would still lose
PurplePillDebate,removed,many a truth in jest youre an older man dont get so upset that you have a heart attack dear
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you big mad or little mad d
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree some people might agree with some rp truths yet react to it differently like some people reading may become paranoid or more blue pilled in lifestyle because they dont want to be a plate or a girl who gets left in the dust at ive seen it cause girls to not want to date or even have sex anymore
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah which is that why most famous people around the world in every culture largely do not marry year olds just because you are a psycho weirdo creep doesnt mean every man is
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes you are hun nice try though
PurplePillDebate,removed,anyway it doesnt matter you are objectively wrong and you are also a creep who seems to obsess over young girlsboys whos taken trp a little too seriously and is now prancing about trying to make women feel bad in every way because what are you insecure jealous
PurplePillDebate,removed,go suck on a pistol

PurplePillDebate,removed,your hand doesnt count as a girlfriend mate
PurplePillDebate,removed,i recognize that i was kidding too but i wouldnt be surprised if she got lonely one night and made a tinder account to seek out all nearby chads
PurplePillDebate,removed,look at all the sheeple falling in line in hopes theyll be honored with your little post of the weak award
PurplePillDebate,removed,what does she get in return your inherent female inferiority complex is running again its not mans fault you were born without a penis yet you continue to mentally fuck yourself what net benefit does she extract to follow what you call her nature try being submissive as your baseline premise honey that was gods plans noone stole your penis life is an exchange you take that to the nth degree stay in your lane
PurplePillDebate,removed,i live to anger people like you lol what a sad sorry pathetic excuse for an organism you are
PurplePillDebate,removed,the idea that women are selfless sounds like male fantasy women can be selfless but only if they get something in return pleasure love whatever so that goes against the notion of selflessness
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp logic man do as i say not as i do
PurplePillDebate,removed,because to them selfless is a feminine trait and being selfish is a masculine trait who is the first woman in a mans life his mother single mother or traditional stay at home mother moms give give give without expecting or wanting anything in return women do most if not all the child rearing selfless i think men going out into the dating world expect women to be like there mom
PurplePillDebate,removed,your anger and the way you treated me that is not feminine behavior women dont get angry like that are you really a woman or are you a guy pretending to be a girl
PurplePillDebate,removed,getting high is wild what are you a fucking mormon

PurplePillDebate,removed,quite right and yet the elite would have us believe that colleges are a den of rape and misogyny lock shillary up
PurplePillDebate,removed,spam
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminists dont seek truth they seek outrage
PurplePillDebate,removed,how this relates to hillary everything ties back to hillary the elite necons northrop grumman sayyid qutb marx monsanto rousseau boehner macmillan wilson etc they setup tents of intellectual groupings cleverly structuring the graph of knowledgeideologies such that each edge may by definition only know a maximum of √n vertices outside of connecting its own two vertices shillary and the ncons know all this of course it was their game all along clever girl
PurplePillDebate,removed,because we have niggas like you reading books and bending over backwards to get their dicks wet maybe thats why
PurplePillDebate,removed,baby want bottle
PurplePillDebate,removed,keep trying yourself that sugartits
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sure there are a few houses like that but in just saying the situation set up in the first post i responded to sounds like it was written by a year old who just say american pie typically no one lives in frat houses im sure there are some but most fraternity members live elsewhere then they have to get a girl to stay the night there then the girl has to claim rape so to avoid that you invite her to a breakfast she was probably just trying to get some dick i wouldnt want to see my ons again in the day light and if she was going to accuse him of rape why would she go to a breakfast idk maybe it was a troll post it just read like someone who had never been to college and is a little logic impaired wrote it
PurplePillDebate,removed,one of these days somebody is going to shoot you with a real bullet you dont get to roll dice to dodge it because life isnt actually a roleplaying game you just die because off of the internet youre not actually faster than a bullet or smart enough to talk people out of killing you or useful enough that they dont have a choice or youll actually try one of your zany ideas that you express on the internet and figure out that there are a lot of steps involved and its actually hard and give up or youll fail at something and run out of money and end up homeless somewhere which today you think you could overcome by just digging deeper and trying harder and finding a way out but in the real world tryings not good enough and nobody helps you out and you remain homeless and broke and hungry forever
PurplePillDebate,removed,you might not be in touch with yourself as you think
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not as worried about these things if im fed and fucking point stands blooper
PurplePillDebate,removed,get the fuck outta here
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course it means to satisfy thats included in love and cherish if you and your wife explicitly agree on a sexually monogamous marriage then yes sex can only happen within the marriage and therefore its part of the deal to sexually satisfy your spouse since you expect him or her not to have sex anywhere else if you arent happy with your wife for any reason you can get a divorce bs and then pay your money to them you sound a bit delusional too discussing sex before marriage doesnt help can you add having sex and every fantasy in a prenup if so wont it be annulled in court because if you cant or if it wont be considered in court then nothing protects a man from a sexless marriage if she can easily change her mind and he cant legally punish her for that and at the same time he cant withdraw commitment money being a father fidelity without it backfiring in case of divorce or serving a good legal reason for divorce then its bs and divorce is not an option for a man and discussing sex is not an option too moreover you cant say women want equality if they dont fight for what i just described to be fixed
PurplePillDebate,removed,i assume most of what you say is the antithesis of honest
PurplePillDebate,removed,they dont like you anymore than a coke head likes their asshole dealer you just think they like you since your ego is huge
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbp is like srs its good as an index of interesting posts beyond that theyre a bunch of selfsatisfied twats
PurplePillDebate,removed,in order to know if blue pill should be taken seriously or as satire i would have to read it i would rather inject human faeces into my eyeball than ready the juvenile thoughts of haters and evopsych deniers
PurplePillDebate,removed,then there are guys like you who for some reason actually like women maybe you were raised soft or you didnt like the things boys liked growing up or you have that madeup bullshit called emotional intelligence whatever the case you dont understand why anyone would need a strategy because youre sick enough to enjoy company with women lol omg that whole paragraph was just classic how cranky can you be
PurplePillDebate,removed,your mother
PurplePillDebate,removed,hii
PurplePillDebate,removed,i feel like red pills cant play this game because theyve overemphasized some weird evolutionary sexual strategy that is counterproductive to having women want to have sex with you they can smell inauthentic shit a mile away guys are constantly trying to fuck them with whatever new hip strategy or mindset that exists yes its all riduculous theyre like spinning off into total chaos every time they egg each other on but what you know it makes sense in one way what other option do they have they can either lay down and die or do the typical male thing as is congruent with fixing something industrial and find a way to fix it things never really change just like the little boy putting the triangle through the circle hole and then finding the triangle redpill men are basically lost
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes sick of masturbating obviously
PurplePillDebate,removed,you should probably go to law school and work as a divorce lawyer rather than doing a google search and claim that someone doesnt know what they are talking about notice that i put common law in quotes because it is not actually a common law marriage but it would take too long to explain the specific legalities rather than using a term that people are more familiar with
PurplePillDebate,removed,race mixing is extremely degenerate
PurplePillDebate,removed,if the upside of being married to him was so slight then the woman needs to take a serious look at her mate selection capabilities and allow elders to pick a suitable husband for her since shes clearly a retard
PurplePillDebate,removed,most human beings have egoinvestment in beliefs that support and validate their own identity and way of life put simply most people are biased towards people like themselves and youre no exception i took his advice and suddenly i was considered sexually attractive way before i was ready to deal with it all meanwhile you just endorse a plan that guilt trips everyone who doesnt want to sacrifice every form of attraction that isnt purely physical because many trp types struggle with advanced social interaction they cant grasp abstract concepts like lets have so much fun together until we practically have to fuck because theyre still waiting for you to explain it to them in computer programming code they cant sexually heal anyone without doing serious internal damage and they claim these as virtues so they compensate by adopting the most popular sex fantasies as biblical script because lets face it sex fantasies almost never lack way too specific details and body sculpting because that works well in math and then they shit on everyone else kind of like youre doing now you really have no shame
PurplePillDebate,removed,stop complaining
PurplePillDebate,removed,please by all means do sell your emotions are we attaching monetary value to things there are different values systems you can use to ascribe value to anything but if you want to use a monetary one then the human body probably sells for less than for its chemical components emotions are common easy to come by everybody has them they achieve little or nothing so because something is common it lacks value this is an absurd point to try and argue everyone has a life but i certainly wouldnt say because my life is common it has no value also regarding what they achieve emotions achieve everything there is nothing that great that has been done that wasnt an emotional labour all the great discoveries and inventions have been pursuits of passion and emotion yes they are worthless you literally cant even sell them on an open market and you will have to give it away for free and people will still not be intrested in them what can be more worthless than that your value system is actually retarded not only are emotions unimportant and worthless but they are more likely to cause stupid choises that are more likely to harm you this is possibly the closest thing to actual true statement you said and only accidentally for all the wrong reasons emotions can blind just like buying into any particular perspective thought system or ideology can blind just because people hurt themselves abusing something doesnt make that something inherently bad so go ahead believe that your emotions are something special if you want to i will and i will be far better off than living a valueless and purposeless nonlife like someone like you
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you read my post youd have seen that i was once very worried about finding or getting it honestly literacy skills amongst rpers seem to be pretty low
PurplePillDebate,removed,god damn ofspock im impressed by your ability to consistently spot my comments and snark them within an hour i just imagine you have a list of ppl on ppd and when a comment goes off from one of us you slide down the pole in full gear like a firefighter into your reddit workstation with a futuristic looking chair and computer rubbing your hands together vigorously to bust out some zings

PurplePillDebate,removed,i think we are referring to the same person ive read through some of her post history and shes legitimately a loony toons crazy female supremacist
PurplePillDebate,removed,the extreme tragedy here is that women dont want to be equal to men anyways at least in the sense that men are still expected to adhere to our gender roles and be the toptier males women want us to be women dont respect men that are equal to them or lesser than them ideally id prefer the concept of rights and all that to be left to a separate realm but it never works that way with people especially since we have the internet
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you one of those people that get their ass kicked a couple times and claim they now have ptsd similar to veterans coming back from war lol

PurplePillDebate,removed,bp itt girls like being dominated but dont you neckbeards dare try it
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not the targeted audience for this question but im answering anyways i lift do boxing and a variety of other activities that require strength and stamina so honestly im stronger than the average women im taller too im as for relationships i love the idea of a size difference and a guy saying something like let me do that youre too little but thats just not a reality for me lol id say me and my current boyfriend are pretty evenly matched in terms of strength ive never really considered it a bad or a good thing as for intelligence were both much more street smart than book smart but hes also more street smart than me if that makes sense both of us barely got through school and i even had to repeat a grade so it doesnt take much to be more intelligent than me really again ive never put much thought into it so i wouldnt mind if i was in a relationship with someone smarter than me as long as they didnt look down on me for it
PurplePillDebate,removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of oral sex between two allegedly heterosexual male friends particular when said friends are wasted abbrev brohj so are you like gay now that ernie sucked your wang no it was totally just a bro job i loves the ladies httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something
PurplePillDebate,removed,its my ridiculing your post because its incredibly dishonest susan cox is one person who was critical of marriage yet its an example of women seeking to liberate themselves from being women in regards to the girly thing im sure some do but in the article you cited thats actually not the case you didnt look into that article you posted and no its not a personal attack this whole post was bullshit coming from you not only that but it turns out my dog has diarrhea which is exactly what this post is
PurplePillDebate,removed,hypocrisy is not some kind of solid logical basis but it is a part of human nature the reconcile it by assuming that we are civilised and superior to our base natural instincts it shouldnt confuse men because it is so easy to fake interest and be impressed this is just a shit test that men fail nonstop because they believe in honesty
PurplePillDebate,removed,because its alright when advances are consented to
PurplePillDebate,removed,its subcommunication the message is that its unattractive to be unattractive and attractive to be attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,then i was raped girl confirmed must have been hard for you saying yes to a guy
PurplePillDebate,removed,according to feminists objectifying women is bad while objectifying men is ok their rationale is that men hold institutional power so they are a free target for criticism and objectification while women as a marginalized group should be exempt from such things the amazing atheist has a nice summary of this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwoqxqmvxuo once you understand that feminism is just double standards in favor of women everything else becomes clearer including their apparently incoherent attitude about being sexualized
PurplePillDebate,removed,why do women tell men its disgusting to objectify a women while at the same time find it sexy to be objectified by a man they deem attractive because in their world its all about them what is right or wrong is dependant on how they feel women trying to be epic again
PurplePillDebate,removed,this doesnt even touch on how women objectify men
PurplePillDebate,removed,rape has to involve penetration of the rapee i should have said maybe hey man you asked for my best troll judging from your response you got what you asked for
PurplePillDebate,removed,httpwwwmitedushaslangmprgnussbaumopdf perhaps you are simply confused and think that when feminists are referring to objectification they mean any sexual attraction whatsoever or perhaps you are under the impression that male sexuality inherently requires treating women like their feelings dont need to be taken into account treating women as interchangeable acting like women are tools to be used for your own purposes etc in which case i would advise you to stop being such a misandrist fuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill just leave this here
PurplePillDebate,removed,the minimum sentence for saying nice tits to a chick was moved up to years last friday didnt you hear unattractive men are being goddamn vilified

PurplePillDebate,removed,if you listen to women this stuff is super commonplace but divorce rape is rare instead of pretending like women are cutesy little snowflakes who would never lie or be biased im going to assume women act like normal people do that is women are conniving and seek to take advantage of every opportunity simply put the women that claim this happens frequently are biased as fuck and full of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,i live in italy and italian men are stereotyped as being obnoxious and constantly approaching and propositioning to women on the streets if you ask me its totally not true ive seen more catcalling from ghetto minorities in the us

PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think it happens near as much as women claim but it does when there is alcohol involved i can understand why so many pretty women have a rbf resting b face because they dont want ugly or even average guys to approach them only about of men can approach of women
PurplePillDebate,removed,and this is why youre a clown firstly because you take analogies literally and secondly because you dont even understand the first thing about fas lol they arent asking you to hand them shit theyve tried time and time again to learn but every time they run into retards like the blue pillers on this sub or dipshits like you who say shit like hurr durr nobody gonna hand you shit bruh nobody has given them constructive advice to help them help themselves out of their own death spiral but nah the fact they were never taught these skills when they were kids is their fault lol i mean how dare they not learn something before they needed to know it fucking lazy arse kids not picking up their fishing rods
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmao deleted your reply huh no worries i caught what that garbage was uiamsounsure lemme play it back for you and this is why youre a clown firstly because you take analogies literally so youre saying i think all fas need a literal fishing rod if you do then youre actually retarded if you dont then maybe you dont know what the fuck a metaphor is and should keep them out of your misinformed brain before spewing out garbage and secondly because you dont even understand the first thing about fas lol let me see how much you have doxxed me and know about me and how much fa incel bullshit i have personally been through they arent asking you to hand them shit except a lot of them are and dont come back with your no true scotsman fallacy bullshit theyve tried time and time again to learn but every time they run into retards like the blue pillers on this sub or dipshits like you who say shit like hurr durr nobody gonna hand you shit bruh yes because me and the tbp are the exact reasons for their failures if only every single time an incel was about to get laid one of us didnt push them back down into pit of fadom can you blame any one else harder for the failure of others nobody has given them constructive advice to help them help themselves out of their own death spiral except for all the advice thats given to them constantly this is a blatant lie the advice ranges from banal platitudes to actionable and thoughtful insight but its there i refuse to believe that no soul could ever possibly conceive the pain and solution to the disease of inceldom but nah the fact they were never taught these skills when they were kids is their fault lol i mean how dare they not learn something before they needed to know it fucking lazy arse kids not picking up their fishing rods there are people that have suffered child abuse sexual abuse and being orphaned who come out on the other side as functioning adults and you want to tell me that someone who is incorrectly socialized cant reprogram themselves fuck off ahahahahahaha dude youre a fucking moron this is comedy gold
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow this is probably the most retarded idea on this sub like ever
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey this was autoremoved by reddits spam filter but your title isnt neutral so this will have to be a cmv post if you want people who agree with you to post toplevel responses i would repost with a title thats not an affirmative claim
PurplePillDebate,removed,mary j blige had a hit in the entitled i can do bad all by myself one of her best tracks thats all i have to contribute to this sub
PurplePillDebate,removed,good luck with that mr sjw

PurplePillDebate,removed,i could imagine thanks for the comment
PurplePillDebate,removed,an easier solution would be just to ban bluepill men its funny you post chads father the dude is pretty much a cryptorp ive been through his account call me a creep i am he looks like a trper he acts like a trper hes shallow like a trper hes a rp without really knowing it i imagine hes been chadtier most of his life therefore to him it just seems like the norm hence why hes bp
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh honey of course i dont want you to think im inconsiderate of your point of view i considered it and i just think that it would be best for us if we did what i say i enjoy our sex life so much i wouldnt want to ruin it for both of us im not being sarcastic or snarky im only doing this out of love
PurplePillDebate,removed,i can feel the love hey dummy is an identical actually a better thread started by an rp guy that i really respect what is the difference between the two i had nothing in my op where i was talking about myself at all why you chose to start an entire thread to take a swing at me i do not understand my thread was valid and good discussion ensued so fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,its in his comments he claims to be dominant hawt and that he gets teh sex all the time the post is just a thin veneer
PurplePillDebate,removed,reported for personal attack
PurplePillDebate,removed,awwwww boo hoooooo
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh no but when trp moves to voat or whatever other shitty board to be disgusting where will we mock them
PurplePillDebate,removed,an oddly agreeable statement op should fuck off wonder if he can cmv
PurplePillDebate,removed,anyone who bothers to read bp knows its not satire talking about mansplaining just makes you sound like an unintelligent teenager
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really need to stop telling me what i am thinking you are always always wrong please stop projecting its very beta your son would be very disappointed
PurplePillDebate,removed,oy vey
PurplePillDebate,removed,mhmm
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah we got a country by manipulating the low iq goyim high five
PurplePillDebate,removed,does it really need to hes kind of a chode
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you know when you look at that little inbox icon next to your username when you click on it you are brought to your inbox your theres an arrow up and an arrow going down click on the arrow going up thats how you give an upvote but thanks for the sweet thoughts and vibrations
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure but theres levels to this shit tping a house is stupid lighting it on fire is fucking retarded in the same way a girl having a drunk ons once or twice is an excusable bad decision doing it times shows horrible judgement and personality traits underage drinking is also a thing and you make some dumb choices when you are young and drunk plus you are in high school and then leave for university which also means that you get to meet new people and your old friendships and relationships grow apart just because a lot or even a majority of people do something stupid doesnt mean its excusable or acceptable teens are naturally experimental and try to broaden their horizon again levels but somehow its considered impossible that women can mature and change why cant you believe that adult women are different compared to how they were when they were she could but the kind of women who has a high ncount by the time she is is most likely going to fail at life at my high school all the high ncount sluts about of them were single moms within years of graduating like stealing your fathers booze getting drunk with your friends stealing his car sitting on top of it while you let a bro try to drive and then crash it and wonder how you even survived most people dont do shit this dumb or being a loud mouthed asshole and getting into unnecessary fights and then stealing some street signs on the way home and getting into trouble with the police you really have a thing for stealing dont you sitting in a shopping cart and getting pushed down a hill and landing in some bushes and thanking god that you still have both eyes both balls and the ability to walk this example is more realistic its dumb but not criminally retarded its the level of stupidity excusable in most teenagers so why is a woman a undateable slut all her life because she tried ons had casual sex with her friends and had some threesomes when she was couldnt it ever be that she might have changed her priorities matured and also became more future oriented shes not i dont understand why high ncount women get upset when guys say they are undateable there are still guys that will date you not everyone has to love you just accept that being high ncount is going to turn away a very sizable chunk men threesomes when she was this screams daddy issues slut would it be fair to judge you all your life for the things you did as a teen again levels people do grow up but people should accept that your actions leave a permanent mark on you a reformed rapist still carries the mark of having been a rapist no matter how sorry or repentant he has been
PurplePillDebate,removed,honestly in high school i was a loser didnt go to parties didnt make out with a dude untillike i was didnt have full blown sex until like i dont have much in my life i truly regret besides letting my low self worth put me in a couple of situations i wasnt ready for the confident me now would not have fallen for said shit i think the bad situations helped me grow as a person but skipping a couple and gaining the confidence anyway would have been nice
PurplePillDebate,removed,is sugardating code for i was a whore for a rich dude
PurplePillDebate,removed,tried to fake my death to stop my ex from stalking me
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a white knight who advocates for feels over objectivity people like you are the reason men get longer prison sentences for equal crime its disgusting
PurplePillDebate,removed,k thanks for the informative and useful post
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh look another entitled whiny post okay ill make this easy a woman who works equally as much as a man should get paid an equal amount as a man a man who does not work equally as hard to become more attractive as a man who is getting laid is not going to get an equal amount of sex women are not entitled to have sex with men they find unattractive because they feel bad
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a nonissue because the actual pay gap is something like cents on the dollar
PurplePillDebate,removed,considering you are someone who thinks that they are owed sex for no apparent reason besides just wanting it i think its safe to say that nobody cares how you feel about equal pay or anything else for that matter whether you care about equal pay or not it wont change the fact that you cant get laid
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you have a source aside from your own bitterness
PurplePillDebate,removed,life experience
PurplePillDebate,removed,great point op women will try and get all specific and diversionary but they wont be able to debunk this concept
PurplePillDebate,removed,because were humans ah gotta love those red herrings bloops drop in these debates the bitterness of these statements is showing sorry if i triggered you
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh poor you
PurplePillDebate,removed,dude this is like posting one painting hitler did of a nice house or field or something and saying look hes not hateful that is literally how ridiculous your argument is in any case what it would take would be years and years of men making exclusively constructive comments in the vein of trps aborted companionsub attempt rbecomeaman the mods would have to aggressively ban the bitter neckbeards and year old edgemasters who have mobbed the place and due to trps ideology not being a sfe space that can never happen
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you really so dense or just a troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have an exam tomorrow likely bullshit school just started for the vast majority of students if your claim is as common as you say it is backing it up would be trivially easy
PurplePillDebate,removed,i never said tricking then what did you mean by make him give you stuff that he wouldnt give you otherwise in what way is that not a trick you keep using the downvote button im not downvoting you whining about imaginary internet points is unbecoming
PurplePillDebate,removed,misogyny everything that doesnt agree with what women say doesnt support women doesnt help women and doesnt see women as part of the women are wonderful social phenomenon
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre not gonna bother replying when i didnt let you get away with a shitty comment and instead hide behind its just a prank bro cute i know all i need to know about you now
PurplePillDebate,removed,any criticism of women which relates to their nature or is all encompassing is misogyny the real question is why is misogyny intrinsically bad
PurplePillDebate,removed,a man breathing
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is what the bluepill gets wrong about the idea that a year old man is more valuable than a year old man it isnt that he gets hotter its that his value in the market increases this post could pretty much be a copypasta reply to these misunderstandings from now on good job
PurplePillDebate,removed,stating a truth like the wage gap is a myth or female athletes generally cannot compete on the same athletic level as male athletes is not misogynistic stating that women do not deserve rights equal to that of men for which there really is absolutely no basis is misogynistic for example women dont offer anything to society women shouldnt be allowed to vote women have the emotional sophistication of children that is misogynistic
PurplePillDebate,removed,hes so focused on women getting their payback that he doesnt see reality
PurplePillDebate,removed,i suppose that is to give men confidence and make them feel superior yup all the dumb shit is just fee fee supportpandering for feminized betas
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats nice dear i just did a poo that stuck out a good inches above the water
PurplePillDebate,removed,just admit that you fucked up becky
PurplePillDebate,removed,your words implied what i assumed becky yes they could literally mean what you state you dont have to win becky debate is for growth
PurplePillDebate,removed,a man whos successful and above average lookingdefinitely
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive always been an effortless dresser so success in people enjoying my style ive always done well in school so always been confident in my academic prowess writing has always been a thing of mine everyone wants me to pen their bio or blog for them or proofread their works and then being a woman who isnt ugly helps with desirability validation from both men and women that said i have insecurities in enough areas to be considered a normal human
PurplePillDebate,removed,i honestly cant tell if you are retarded or a troll gonna cry about normies next
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree ive known plenty of young guys some guys as young as who have dated women years and up but the relationships are never serious dating a cougar can be a form of validation for young men and it is a fun experience specially since many times they are well off women who will buy you stuff but i doubt many guys actually take them serious a woman over is already old if you stay with her for a couple years like youre gonna witness her become an old fart and wish you never got into the relationship in the first place
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre going to waste my time you might as well learn something httpsenwikipediaorgwikiescalationofcommitment
PurplePillDebate,removed,masochism
PurplePillDebate,removed,haha lovely youre insulting me constantly by referring to womens behaviour vs mens behaviour its passive aggression i pointed this out as people issue sure im projecting my views onto people all of us here are doing that all the time when we theorise about human behaviour and what motivates us its not the crime you think it is no one wants brutal honesty people say this to sound edgy and men are more prone to wanting to sound edgy ime than women unapologetic honesty or respectful honesty perhaps brutal no mean girl frenemies and cliques are all cliches people are not a bad ya novel jfc
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one is forcing you to do anything and you realize your argument is as stupid as my question right
PurplePillDebate,removed,ruh roh another bloopy infurryated by my antics looks like im in the doghouse again tonight
PurplePillDebate,removed,because red pill is first and foremost sexist in its outlook therefore women get shit on routinely while men get lifted up as often as possible
PurplePillDebate,removed,ooooooooo i bet that got you tendies and a case of mountain dew a tip of thee fedora to you sir
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh so the nazis arent racist because they actually believed it
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think one can infer bpers on tbp not here are quite misandrist and gynocentric
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you actually a long con bper or do you really not understand the bait you just took
PurplePillDebate,removed,love how you worked in the humblebrag about getting your cock sucked
PurplePillDebate,removed,have you even ever gotten a blowjob because that screams blowjobvirgin or you are the most boring person to give blowjobs to women certainly do check up on you periodically if you still enjoy it even if you just stop moaning and dont move your hips rhythmically anymore for a while they will ask if they are doing everything correctly or they will look you into your eyes and ask it with their body language they would certainly notice it if you would freeze up and would ask whats wrong theres a constant communication going on nonverbally so that you dont have to ask all the time but dirty talk is sexy so we also do that but even though your post sounds logically sound you are still purposely moving the goal post to put a bad light on women and to make them look like children the whole debate started with women that freeze up due to their brains rape instinct triggering its fight or flight but you are holding them down so they cant flee and they are much weaker so they cant fight thus their brain chooses to save them by freezing up just like a deer that looks into the headlights of a car would rather scream fight or run away but they just cant the deer doesnt consent to getting run over just because its incapable of jumping away its not that women are weak little children that cant even speak up when they dont enjoy the sex its that sometimes people freeze up during sex and trpers use this as propaganda against women if they are too afraid to speak up and communicate in a consensual sexual encounter about something they dont like they shouldnt be having sex if a man cant even figure out if the person hes having sex with enjoys it or is frozen up with terror they shouldnt be having sex
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,now i think you are even more of a child for throwing a tantrum over a post you dont like someone help this child needs validation that he is being taken seriously
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think both should be punished but the latter should be punished far more i think most people are idiots who wont do the right thing unless punished otherwise
PurplePillDebate,removed,its almost as if trp doesnt make sense
PurplePillDebate,removed,translation i disagree with this idea but have no valid counterargument to it so poison the well
PurplePillDebate,removed,not an argument just poisoning the well
PurplePillDebate,removed,still no counterargument just poisoning the well
PurplePillDebate,removed,alex is a stupid nigger
PurplePillDebate,removed,you have no counterargument to anything in the essay so you resort to poisoning the well
PurplePillDebate,removed,you have no counterargument so you resort to poisoning the well every response you have is just point and sputter
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you actually have a valid counterargument to anything in this post all you do is poison the well
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre just poisoning the well because you have no valid counterargument to whats been asserted here
PurplePillDebate,removed,again you have no counterargument so you resort to ad hominems you want to be a debate sub start by forming a valid counterargument
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill be sure to hold your hand all the way to the end of the next post i link but does that make a capacity for provisioning inherently a beta trait i think its easy to misconstrue that capacity as beta because provisioning is a highvalue attribute that is expected from beta men according to their own sexual strategy provisioning is associated with betas because it is integral to their sexual strategy and also part of the blue pill plan for which women are hoping to fulfill at a point in their maturity when they are subjectively at their most necessitous what do you think
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not a death sentence its solitary confinement women just step on you when youre only inches tall
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh so sexism and racism were not ok in the past but they are ok now seriously why dont you go apologize to your ex wife for whatever you did to her
PurplePillDebate,removed,women get tired of men more often and have all the incentives in divorce lol at cucks getting married
PurplePillDebate,removed,next time wont waisted my time arguing with someone not in good faith that said if you had vague knowledge of his writing my citation of the quote would be sufficient because you would have some knowledge youre lack of proves you have zero credulity with which to be skeptical you selfrighteous prick
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe you should read more postwall hag also wouldnt share my writing with you even if it was youre irrelevant
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why you are creepy littlewindowpane
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do too exist
PurplePillDebate,removed,barely even human
PurplePillDebate,removed,heres a sneak peek of rgendercritical using the httpsnpredditcomrgendercriticaltopsorttoptall of all time im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot
PurplePillDebate,removed,agreed
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont be stupid i didnt say no custody at all so quit trying to go to extremes you know i meant primary
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sorry but you moved the goalposts dont do that if you want to be taken seriously my statement wasnt i can tell you reasons why women are scum stop doing this every left leaning poster on ppd
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol head on over to rdeadbedroom and be hailed as their messiah lol im sure youve got it all figured out
PurplePillDebate,removed,because everything you said is bullshit get a job and fund your own retirement women need to stop stealing from men
PurplePillDebate,removed,im purple leaning towards a shade of red but thing that turns me away from rtrp is the fact that behind their facade of selfimprovement bravado not caring they are really just betas i mean really how alpha can you be if you spend inordinate amounts of time worrying about what women think and how to be successful with them
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wonder who will be laughing when you get your ass divorce raped dude
PurplePillDebate,removed,trp seems to think there is only one universal definition of attractiveness completely blind to the idea that different people do find different things attractive see this is why we need trp to point out bullshit like this attraction is not unique for every individual special snowflake we are all attracted to same things facial symmetry healthy body healthy skin sexual arousal is an instinct it happens regardless of what you rationalize an attractive person to be is an regardless of who the man is
PurplePillDebate,removed,do attack helicopters have a chance
PurplePillDebate,removed,something something money something
PurplePillDebate,removed,or maybe they hit the wall and panic and are tired of playing games
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think we should cut funding to mental health services and start up an organisation for dealing with the dangers of male entitlement any blue pillers around here want to help me start it up and collect huge salaries to do nothing
PurplePillDebate,removed,definitely the real issue regarding muslims with guns and bombs and headremoving blades is that we hold them to too strict of a standard of masculinity they just wanted to wear a brukha without being laughed at
PurplePillDebate,removed,breathtaking mental contortions
PurplePillDebate,removed,muslim declares hes killing in the name of islam after becoming radicalized must be because hes a man
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey guys looks like weve figured it out all we need to stop terror attacks is more feminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a combination of bad mental health and guns being more available than ops mom for most of them
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course cant blame isis then obama might actually have to address an important issue
PurplePillDebate,removed,my original comment is already a response to the op it was a really crappy comment so either you misunderstood or didnt read or just dont really have much to say shame its an interesting topic that hopefully does result in some interesting responses
PurplePillDebate,removed,its always about the poor poor women
PurplePillDebate,removed,perhaps you are not capable of intelligent comment better leave it unsaid then
PurplePillDebate,removed,so men are broken because they dont respond to social and emotional stimuli like women do mmmmm lets have some more of that enlightened sjw empathy
PurplePillDebate,removed,see youre being sexist in order for me to take you seriously you have to believe in your own views first you say men and women are no different gender is a social construct and were all blank states but then you turn around and say but most shootings are done by men are we all special snowflakes or not
PurplePillDebate,removed,this as well the will of penis compels you
PurplePillDebate,removed,violence because of some primal instinct or testosterone fuck no look whos uneducated culture that despises homosexuality yes thats partially true though women are a part of that culture too women hate homosexuality just as men do in such cultures and toxic masculinity has nothing to do with it most shootings are done by men isnt a stereotype like awalt its a statistic that is backed by actual studies a simple google will confirm this first youre still being sexist you are prejudiced against men by assigning aggression and violence based solely on gender statistics or not if you assume a person is violent just because he is male without even knowing him you are sexist now awalt is not a stereotype and redpill is not just anecdotes it is based on statistics too women initiate most divorces women never have trouble getting sex women get custody most of the time women get alimony most of the time women earn less but spend multiple times more than men dont get me started on evolution and analysis of women through evolutionary perspective actual studies as a side note not all studies are gospel scientists can have bias too some researchers study things with a goal of proving feminist agenda some would rather not proceed with their findings lest they be called backwards misogynistic and get their lives ruined by sjws and feminist terrorists
PurplePillDebate,removed,omar was totally entitled albeit battling some toxic masculinity conflicts but he felt entitled to his hate against gays elliot rogers felt entitled to his hate against women thats some seriously asinine stuff you just wrote go slap yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,some fucked up religious extremist committed violence and liberal shitheads cant bear to say yeah some muslims are dangerous on account of being muslim because thats bigoted so theyre trying to spin this as some men are dangerous because men are more likely to be violent but hey this wouldnt be a proper feminist interpretation if its idiocy factor wasnt through the roof
PurplePillDebate,removed,how can men and women work together if we have completely different goals and ideas of what a utopia should look like men want strife and individual struggle women want collective harmony like that survivor episode
PurplePillDebate,removed,marry a man who loves you more than you love him my mother once told me when you hold a mans hand and he makes your heart beat faster and he makes you feel giddy and excited walk away from this man he is not the man for you if you hold a mans hand and he makes you feel warm safe and secure hold onto him this is the man you are going to marryroll your eyes at and dead bedroom after your first child
PurplePillDebate,removed,communication is for feelings that is what gets you nowhere this is one of the most retarded things i have heard in a long time you think great things are accomplished in a vacuum without discussion planning problem solving brainstorming just the most alpha guy in the group just grunts and fucking rockets get built christ
PurplePillDebate,removed,it really is just not at all the way you think lmao
PurplePillDebate,removed,your second link doesnt work
PurplePillDebate,removed,not bp but my opinion is that the main reason dr nerdlove is accepted by bp and trp is not is because dr nerdlove steps on egg shells not to hurt anybodies feefees
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes i think its good that pretty much all references to any expertise or claims by twerp sources are listed in quotes as befits their questionable status
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh they dont hate women though they just have zero respect for them or consideration for their feelings and actual needs outside of what they want from women
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh wow youve met all women and gotten to know them on a personal level you must be so busy and important
PurplePillDebate,removed,starlord man
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are doing this wrong dont want to feed you but men have meaningful jobs that they work unlike httpsenwikipediaorgwikianitasarkeesian and httpsenwikipediaorgwikifeminism behind them
PurplePillDebate,removed,or maybe we should acknowledge our nature and agree with it instead of rejecting it and delude ourselves into thinking were all blank states
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you do anything physical regularly no keyboarding does not count if you dont then okay you dont use your muscles does it not bother you that your build is similar to a womans or are you proud of it
PurplePillDebate,removed,time to close up shop guys trp is false
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont get it are we pretending hes not just some random pua with a blog his advice might be great and if it is then its compatible with trp easily anything that can be used to increase your odds in the game of love is trp the point is to have a sexual strategy that works
PurplePillDebate,removed,learn statistics learn how averages work what medians are and study some number distribution
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey i dont want to change your view i skipped breakfast and dinner today and spent two hours at the gym today we can be equal together you should be witty too if you possibly can lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,women pretty much just need to not be fat thats it
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah the beauty standards for mens looks are almost as high as for women but in addition there are tons of financial social and behavioral standards women will never ever be confronted with
PurplePillDebate,removed,you know it was your looks
PurplePillDebate,removed,the truth is that blue pillers and feminists are completely ok with hate speech discrimination and even outright violence as long as the target is a group they dislike punching up and all that go look at any feminist sub the hateful venomous way they talk about men and rant about male privilege and toxic masculinity they dont realize that theyre just as bad as the most frothingly misogynist redpiller because they have trained themselves to view the world through a feminist lens and are thus incapable of empathizing with and understanding men
PurplePillDebate,removed,to the extent that tbp has an ideology it is feminazi with the corresponding love for censorship and blanket suppression of all potential sources of contrary opinion
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know in trper land nobody ever does anything wrong by mistake and honest communication solves nothing because its all a battle between men and women i know in trper land mutual respect between equals doesnt exist im not sure why you expect me to engage with that adolescent fantasy but very well
PurplePillDebate,removed,rekt
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant stand tbp to be honest rp definitely has its issues and crazy people but tbp reminds me of a bunch of smug nerds sitting back and making fun of them in a smug and snarky way then patting each other on the back for it
PurplePillDebate,removed,femininity responds to masculinity who knew
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is because blue pillers assume that trp men have nothing going for them they assume that trp men are ugly basement dwellers with no money ambition or charisma if someone like that came up to you and acted like theyre some sort of relationship prize of course theyd get blown off but when you pair the trp mentality towards relationships with a decentlooking or even goodlooking man or with a man whos ambitious has a bit of success and is fun to be around women swoon blue pillers dont believe guys like this exist on trp so of course they dont believe trp works on normal women
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbp make these claims because they too have the virtuous woman delusion ingrained in their minds to them proper women are not influenced by female instincts and thus cannot be won over by strategies aiming at female insincts
PurplePillDebate,removed,its a no true scotsman fallacy no secure woman would fall for trp nonsense therefore if it worked despite any evidence to the contrarywell she most have been insecure
PurplePillDebate,removed,men commit more violence than women see we told you men are violent le toxic masculinity yesallwomen men need to be sent to the reeducation camps men discover virtually every useful technology and build society as we know it today this must be the patriarchy holding the poor womyn down social factors are responsible men arent naturally better at anything we need more womyn in science and math muh affirmative action you cant have it both ways dumbshit femicunts
PurplePillDebate,removed,so its just a position of being against using force or aggression or ass im going to stop you at ass because the rest of that sentence was ridiculous and i didnt come here to assist you in your selfgratification
PurplePillDebate,removed,black and proud black lives matter
PurplePillDebate,removed,they dont actually believe that its all just projection in reality they know that women in general are far more honorable and they hate that fact
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah but what causes the difference in testosterone level in men and women the systematic oppression of women of course checkmate
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant even spell why would anyone care about what you think
PurplePillDebate,removed,fucking boom if i or any rp tried to assert that we would have blues chiming in left and right about well not me or my social circle or any woman i know were specul snowflakes blah blah blah we know what youre doing
PurplePillDebate,removed,you need to cope harder
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you keep rejecting women who proposition you because of your standards dont call yourself an incel
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound like some like ugly subhuman shitbag swagme im sure youre probably redpill lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,i can get that i bet my ambition would be a little lacking if i could get what i wanted in life just by having a pussy between my legs
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean the examples are literally too numerous but i feel like if i start posting examples youre going to miss the main point here youre arguing that these are overt points of contention they are not they are covertcontextual issues unless you can understand that what youre doing is instead strawmanningbeing autistic about it you really really have to understand what im saying before im going to get sucked into your black hole here it appears to me at this point that you actually dont get it
PurplePillDebate,removed,good thread there are no overt messages rp guys are bad at life and they gravitate
PurplePillDebate,removed,good thread there are no overt messages tho rp is for guys who are bad at life one of the reasons they gravitate to rp is because rp is the pacifier for all their butt hurt cant get laid its not your fault society is to blame women are to blame feminism is to blame whats really ironic is that deep down rp is saying the same thing it accuses society of saying youre a good man but society and hypergamous women refuse to acknowledge it not your fault its pathetic

PurplePillDebate,removed,this is what trp has been saying all along women are selective in what they find acceptable and unacceptable they want to adopt the cool nerd label without actually associating with real nerd type guysthe problem here is that the guys who shes meeting through pokemon go are lowsmv omegabetas not chads with abs this is has nothing to do with pokemon go and everything to do with the fact that the hobby she enjoys is full of lowsmv males who make her stomach turn so much for the advice try to meet girls who have similar interests as you looks like thats been completely blown out the water awalt

PurplePillDebate,removed,got it standard for rape now is kind of all you bloopers just let us know when youre done moving the goalposts
PurplePillDebate,removed,you can answer my question that you conveniently skipped over and then ill answer yours what is the females responsibility in this scenario but this whole conversation is why i straight up stay away from women its too risky when idiots are going to bend over backwards to relieve them of any and all responsibility its just not worth the risk
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice dodge let me know if youd actually like to debate i mean we were just about to put a woman in the white house thank god we didnt i mean according to you she would have been likely to freeze up and not even vocalize anything in a dangerous or stressful situation
PurplePillDebate,removed,is this a good angle do you like this etc baaahaha blooper sex is so hawt i think ill just go for the simpler way and have a feminist observer in my bedroom that way when she sees an uncertain look on my partners face she can blow her antirape whistle and we can all stop and talk i can remember a day when the republican party used to be lambasted as the party that wanted to regulate the bedroom now its the regressive left
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont be an idiot its the act of being penetrated and no gays that get fucked in the ass are not as masculine thats the definition you dont have any news for me you have moronic definitions that dont hold up under the slightest inspection
PurplePillDebate,removed,so let me make sure i have this straight expecting a female to revoke consent in a clear concise and audible fashion is too high of a bar yet expecting a man to recognize the nonverbal unspoken revocation of consent is not do you realize how dumb you sound right now

PurplePillDebate,removed,halo effet
PurplePillDebate,removed,have you considered the possibility you may be a misogynist you sound completely out of touch with how horribly oppressive those cultures are i think you should listen to bo burnham straight white male song its the whole problem with this way of thinking you simply cannot draw a comparison to the two the horrors of the oppressive patriarchy in backwards outdated cultures is more pervasive and unjust than what men face today in western society this is not to discount the issues of a modern western white heterosexual male but simply to get your eyes on the biggest picture women are people too they have the right to freedom and persuit of happiness if you understood how institutionalized and pervasive it was in their society you would not be saying things like how its worth it thanks to alpha cock thats not how it works for all humans in our western world we are in flux as women strive to achieve the same rights as men there are problems with society but its still changing as new generations are coming along and changing what sexuality and everything is its not going to go backwards so if i were you id start thinking forward
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was watching this hentai one time guy takes a girl who was legal in the country in which this movie was made and completely breaks her down and humiliates her using drugs bdsm basically mind control by the end shes been turned into a living sex doll who can only orgasm speak in tongues and beg for more cock thats a happily ever after feasible not sure probably not in the west and not without a certain amount of startup capital and ruthlessness
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not binary life is not binary this is probably why you have trouble socializing
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you believe in argument from authority god must exist because the overwhelming majority of theologians believe in him lol i love it when feminists try to logic so cute
PurplePillDebate,removed,xhe forgot about the microaggressions
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you were as smart as you seem to think you are you would be aware of the fact that young men who arent tied down by family with no perspective nothing to gain by peaceful effort and nothing to lose by opting out of society can be a tremendous source of unrest you do know what the extremist paramilitaries of the in europe had in common or the islamist terrorists or the disenfranchised masses that are basically invading europe at the moment you guessed it no jobs no income no respect no attention from women for muslims its even worse considering that the option of premarital sex usually isnt even on the table in the first place how does the fair sex or sex in general factor into this well to quote dave chapelle if men could get laid in a cardboard box they wouldnt buy houses ie the tendency of alienated males to lash out against society to go tribal on each other is in no small part due to the fact that their live is shitty and that because of their shitty lives women wont pay attention to them and that all of this can be either rectified or at least made more bearable by pursuing the life of someone who is a threat to society in one way or another anecdote time in the heyday of revolutionary arab terror the there was one group i think it was the black september but am not sure here that had become too much trouble for their backers and were pacified by marrying them off when they approached them again years later to see what they had become they noticed that the willingness of these guys to risk their lives has been dried up now that they had wives and children that was a very silly post you should be ashamed for writing it and you deserve a pat on the nose with a rolledup newspaper because of it
PurplePillDebate,removed,have you ever actually spoken to a person im real life or do you just walk around and assume people ignore you due to your false sense of superiority you incels get so pissed off at women for ignoring you and thinking theyre better but here you are claiming to be one of the best men in the world its really hilarious i mean youve called yourself the most special snowflake of all your powers of projection would be impressive if you werent so pathetic dude men who are actually great dont feel the need to tell anyone they just go about their lives being great the fact that you keep having to say it to convince yourself just proves it beyond a doubt youre not great youre not special youre actually quite tragic but please tell everyone again how much better you are than them and make sure you just say without providing any reasons why that way you can keep your delusion going and no one can point out why youre wrong
PurplePillDebate,removed,op should really specify a girls smv on this and will most likely have differing experiences same as polarizing or niche women tattoos coloured hair the loveorhate type women
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah still too insulting these if you were as wellinformed as you seem to think you are and that was not a very valuable post you should be ashamed for writing it and you deserve a pat on the nose with a rolledup newspaper because of it are far too incivil

PurplePillDebate,removed,im a year old virginshould i kill myself
PurplePillDebate,removed,eh this sounds lame sorry but all this mumbo jumbo about what men and women really want is silly i think it varies from one individual to another so you cant blanket the whole gender this way i prefer a equal relationship where we both get to be dominant and submissive from time to time push and pull you know but its a lot of equal to me yeah i like equality the most
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was with you at first but the reality is i dont care that much about power for powers sake i only care about being adored respected and getting what i want not having the ability to tell somebody else what to that being said im inclined to agree that there is no natural intersexual power order males and females operate in difference hierarchies in different spheres the illusion of male dominance over females is lip service paid to the of men who were powerless farmwar meat i doubt relationships ever worked like that privately either
PurplePillDebate,removed,let split those races the sad truth is black people have an average iq of i dont believe in any affirmative action because smart people should only be opened to college regardless of skin color asians actually have points taken away because they were doing better than the average white family due to their higher average in iq and work ethicsculture any form of quota is basically saying you guys are weak or dumb or incapable of doing x so we are going to help out because feelings which is stupid let nature take its course life in unfair

PurplePillDebate,removed,off the top of my head when i was at uni a really drunk girl came on to me i was appalled as she was barely in a fit state to stand up one office job i did the young cleaner who worked there was completely in love with me it was flattering but she wasnt for me another time i was on a course and i had a pretty good rapport with a girl who was on it i can be quite funny at times and i made her laugh a lot i didnt have any intention of chatting her up she just wasnt my type at all but at the end of the course she gave me her number ironically i had tried to chat up the woman who was presenting the course but was very rapidly given the cold shoulder not unreasonably so as i later found out that she had a boyfriend other women have hit on me in nightclub student union type situations and ive rebuffed them for one reason or another looking back if id had no standards i could have notched my bedpost a lot more than i have but its just not my thing probably other women have had crushes on me that ive forgotten about disregarded or not even noticed it happens all the time its just that we forget when we reject others but remember when we ourselves are rejected

PurplePillDebate,removed,oh please weve already been through this youre the elephant man no face as hideous as your face was ever meant for heavens light etc then when i show you all the ugly people who are doing awesome you cite your ugly personality and declare victory theres two possibilities youre a masochist on a self righteous pyrrhic high singing the mgtow version of let it go while you build up your magic fortress because seriously once you give up youre not an incel anymore youre under the grip of dunning kruger instead and theres no point in debating you because at this point you couldnt seriously process an alternative point of view if you tried youre right you are too ugly inside and out only well never know since youre not about to find out what your limits are im sure whatever else youre doing instead is way more important
PurplePillDebate,removed,gender equality is not a target for feminism its a female advocacy movement that uses the rights and privileges that males have as a benchmark to aim for in areas where females are disadvantaged which of course is fair enough feminism has no interest in addressing areas where males are disadvantaged again i dont hold it against feminism but its not about men which is a gender therefore it cant adequately be described as campaigning for gender equality
PurplePillDebate,removed,recently in the uk misogyny has been considered a hate crime which sounds reasonable until you read things like hate crime is a very orwellian term we should all be worried about this hate is an emotion criminalising peoples emotions is extremely fucked up and dehumanising this is a sign of the future people pretty soon you wont be allowed to think or feel anything that the party doesnt want you to think or feel fight this nonsense or become a slave those are your options

PurplePillDebate,removed,she
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think they dont like incels because the idea of male issues whether it might be lonelinessalienation or institutional discrimination is not compatible with their leftist ideology the left has a different core target women minorities gays trans so they mock and belittle male issues as a rule of thumb
PurplePillDebate,removed,cut what out telling the truth
PurplePillDebate,removed,most trans people dont even pass and the ones who do will no longer be seen as their preferred gender by most people after they find out they are trans the opinion of trans people concerning concerning gender differences is worthless

PurplePillDebate,removed,are you a male or female gender aside
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you need to get off the internet and meet real people
PurplePillDebate,removed,if a girl is raped we should take no measure at all to help her avoid being victimized another time not nobody just not you and other guys that think they are experts on the topic even though everyone that understands it just laughs at you for being so overconfident in your bullshit suppose we do nothing suppose she was victimized because she became too intoxicated at a club if it happens again do we just accept it for what it is no but you clearly lack any understanding for why it might have happened again and its even clearer that you should just shut up and let people that are smart enough to understand it talk about it what are you proposing as a solution you are too focused on easy solutions to figure out what should actually be done imagine you are their parents and you want them to stay away from drugs sure you can tell them that drugs are bad and that they just shouldnt take them but thats the easy solution where you dont have to use your brain dont need no empathy and just give them some useful advice but no matter how often you tell them that they shouldnt take drugs they will just do it if they feel like it or if they dont care about the things you say if they hate you they will take drugs just to spite you if you want to keep them away from drugs or at least want to teach them how to take drugs responsible you should tell them why people take drugs and why they get addicted how they can safely take drugs what self destructive behavior is and how to get out of depression where to get high quality drugs what the difference between the various drugs are that they can rely on you should they ever need help to get clean or if they want to talk about their problems what the dangers are and a whole lot of other stuff if you just offer them solutions like just dont take drugs and only tell them that its dangerous without explaining why it is dangerous then it is basically useless but if you educate them and get them to understand it then they will be more responsible with drugs they will be able to notice when they are falling back into their old habits and they will be able to figure out when they are getting addicted and when they have problems they can solve the problem by the root drug abuse is often just a symptom of other problems instead of getting rid of the symptoms should they start to take drugs you would tell them just stop taking them because you lack empathy and literally cant understand the situation although you should actually try to help them overcome the issues that made them addicted in the first place you cant just offer easy solutions without going into detail and without taking the why into account women that end up getting victimized over and over again are often putting themselves in such situations on purpose or because they dont even care anymore they are too weak to say no and some believe they deserve it others are used to it and think its just the way it is and others are engaging in self destructive behavior where getting raped is like their form of cutting some like danger and some think it wont ever happen to them your solutions dont help them at all and only make it worse because you help them blaming themselves more you are just putting more salt in their wounds you are not qualified to give advice on topics you dont understand so just dont do it let others that know what they are doing do it there is no need for you to solve this problem
PurplePillDebate,removed,my cock is so long and wonderful i alpha widow all women that i get up in the thing about alpha widowing is it has nothing to do with the man himself but how the woman perceives the man the memory of the man nine out of ten times is more powerful than the actual man no mortal man will ever live up to it take away sexuality and replace with something like using a fast computer i know you spergs intjs and robots love to talk about your computers but humans are extremely complex and well yeah we are going to compare our other partners with previous ones the part i disagree about is that the man has to be an alpha to widow a woman and that the woman will never be satisfied again until she finds mr perfect in some casesprobably most but i cant sit peer reviewed sources shell probably move on like a regular person unless shes damaged with codependency problems

PurplePillDebate,removed,but its not a death sentence you need to max out your other areas and go for shorter chicks almost dont know any shorter girls and dont find the ones i do not particulary attractive it might not be a death sentence but suicide is always an option i have though about it for years this thread just confirms everything i ever knew
PurplePillDebate,removed,the bloopy made a value judgement about analytical vs feefee intelligence exposing how out of touch with reality he is a guy tooling around with a computer most likely isnt going to be a panty dropper doesnt sound like a great counter argument to women select against intelligence to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,i wonder why
PurplePillDebate,removed,well the mods have told me that in this echo chamber they will remove any comment that asks about your biological sex so thanks to that modding i cant really continue this discussion in any productive manner i do already know the answer btw i mean your tumblr is the same as your reddit name its not rocket surgery
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know about of them who definitely are probably wont admit it though so you have a point this is far too common on ppd some blue piller asks a loweffort question anyone whos ever read anything about survey methodology can think of a half dozen reasons people lie in their responses some red piller gives a reasonable detailed answer with an example to illustrate it actually engaging that response takes effort so the blue piller defaults to ignoring the substance of the issue in favor of a cheap shot at trp is this how youd have a conversation with a friend
PurplePillDebate,removed,how does it feel to be so full of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,i shoulda learned by now not to feed the trolls
PurplePillDebate,removed,that little fucker is the result of years of blue pill indoctrination dont feed us this bullshit elliot rodger didnt go on a killing spree because he was too nice to women he was mentally ill he started getting psychological help as an year old
PurplePillDebate,removed,we even pack them individual gift baskets
PurplePillDebate,removed,monogamy isnt natural monogamy is seen in nature all the time so i dont quite understand why youd say something so asinine
PurplePillDebate,removed,really youre gonna pull the not every manwoman bs on here again come on id rather date a guy who is comfortable in his own body than some insecure gym rat who feels he must exercise daily lol also httpwwwmenshealthcomsexwomenmuscularmenattractwomen
PurplePillDebate,removed,citing a study doesnt change what someones individual opinion is and so what the platitude of not every woman finds the muscle bound weightlifter body most attractive is factually incorrect according to multiple studies and i provided the citation you cannot change the rules of how debates work according to your interests reality doesnt work that way not every manwoman is a valid point in threads like this where things like body image and ideals are being discussed no its not a valid point in any discussion its a garbage point there are always outliers and extremes they are always going to be anomalies its a moot point and its just deflecting talk from the real issues and thats not even addressing the main point that i made in fact i never said that every woman finds muscles attractive never did i say that give me a break with this nonsense
PurplePillDebate,removed,eh no one cares enough to type np before their links enjoy the decline boy societys going to hell in a hand basket
PurplePillDebate,removed,i love that my husband is the only man ive been with wow thats so awesome and romantic i wish things had gone like that for me yeah right you are probably cucking him daily with the chad down the street you slut awalt

PurplePillDebate,removed,go ask mom for some tendies kiddo
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not a leftist go rant about roasties somewhere else
PurplePillDebate,removed,bp wont like these facts theyve really dug into their entitlement to be cunts to their sos
PurplePillDebate,removed,and so what you asked for input from people and they gave it and now you want to fight them and tell them theyre wrong for not sharing the majority opinion their response was not to the video it was to me in my previous posts its just attacking people for responding to your request for input with views you dont personally enjoy or agree with they are the one attacking my viewpoint by using the not very manwoman rhetoric tool what i cant defend my position now get outta here then why even go loling at other people who say they and some other women arent attracted to men with muscles because of the time its nonsense and we have the studies to prove it
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill date young women only when im in my just lol if these bitches think theyll shame men into fucking old bitter hags
PurplePillDebate,removed,women dont really want to take stem classes or work in stem fields to the most degree womens studies majors want to pretend their is discrimination so that they can argue for increased pay for worthless fieldsmajors because they couldnt go into the higher paying subjects because of discrimination basically they want neurosurgeon salaries for studying bullshit subjects without having to do the work to become a neurosurgeon its a great racket if you can get it
PurplePillDebate,removed,you know its just jealousy and all the reasons are just rationalizations it is amusing to watch the wheels spin though
PurplePillDebate,removed,cannot handle the challenge of a woman their own age and socioeconomic status this is one of the most typical and manginaish comments that i hear also one of the easiest to dispel i have had long relationships with women my age and socioeconomic status also regarding the same socioeconomic status i have dated plenty of girls who were in their or early who had as much or more money than me i live in sydney being rich here is pretty normal you sir have a hamster that any woman would be deeply proud to call her own
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah why dont quotas work for gender studies if there are too many women in there tell half of them to study science i am sure that would work out well
PurplePillDebate,removed,shes full of it its a older female sexual market strategy attempting to lock down higher value older men they could never get once younger women are thrown into the equation thats the real reason
PurplePillDebate,removed,but then they would have to do real work its much easier to pretend you are oppressed and extort money out of men they dont want to put in the work that stem requires
PurplePillDebate,removed,and i am literally telling you that you are a liar would you approach those guys in the street would any woman do that the answer is no and the reason is simple they are not attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not blue but i would say the evidence is in how drawn women are to celebrities every woman has at least once had some interest in a male celebrity it might be a conventionally rich and famous guy or it might be an artsy intellectualoid type of guy but you can find its true for every woman
PurplePillDebate,removed,god damn dude just post to insult no substance at all id be ashamed to be as hopeless as you
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh its my stalker from yesterday just use logic that scares her away
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey double chin what is stopping you from going to your fantasy third world country and finding yourself a wife you are like those mgtow guys who keep talking about they have gone away just go do it nobody want to stop you
PurplePillDebate,removed,what in the wide wide world of fuck are you talking about son
PurplePillDebate,removed,there are babies being born first off oh yeah where that women make babies because they want to make them women make babies because they have baby rabies thats all they arent interested in humanity their eggs just begin to rot and they pop out a kid or two before they become sterile the rest of your post is babble and not worth responding to you know im right dude touchdown i win
PurplePillDebate,removed,nor does it mean that she doesnt no matter how much you want that to be true its not so i guess the debate is over some relationships are good and some are bad great thanks captain obvious is it that your wife hates you so you want to believe that everyone elses also hates them your shitty relationship doesnt mean a thing about any other relationship
PurplePillDebate,removed,they will be even more concerned if the individual is not particularly ugly because it implies there is something wrong with their very personality wait your are attractive and cant get laid whats wrong with your personality nothing women are all just hypergamous sluts that only sleep with super hot assholes and not nice guys like me
PurplePillDebate,removed,being sexually attracted to someone does not mean its a good relationship you are the only one making that assumption if a guy is in a relationship its a good one again no one says that youre making that up to make a point that doesnt make sense youre now just spewing bullshit to save face because its become obvious to everyone what a stupid post this is sorry but you lost this entire argument the moment you decided to make the stupid post go ahead and tell me more lies though i wont be responding to you because youre not interested in anything except your own completely false argument no interest in your lies and your bitterness
PurplePillDebate,removed,which is a posh way of saying womens hormones turn off their brains and they just go ahead and make a huge decision for both parties based solely on the fact that it gives her the warm and fuzzies and then society steps in and picks up the pieces with my taxes
PurplePillDebate,removed,not anyones son and certainly not yours kiddo well i dont think id have an ugly son so you are probably right just took a glance at the replies here and seen you try to tell actual women that what theyve experienced and what theyve seen is incorrect because you with your infinite life experience somehow know better women are going to lie and tell stuff that will make them appear nonshallow
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you are funny
PurplePillDebate,removed,so how long have you had one ive had stints with the so prior to mrp ive talked with hundreds of guys during this time of the time the guy gets hawt learns a little game and stops taking shit the problem miraculously goes away i guess youre the first one who has a hot dude with great seduction and still doesnt want to fuck him congradulations
PurplePillDebate,removed,and the sun came up i cant change your view who needs tinder i can walk down the stairs outside down the sidewalk and into any store cafe bar etc
PurplePillDebate,removed,i feel like ive read multiple incongruent views espoused by you before on various ppd issues are you schizophrenic by any chance i see you are replying to yourself now so thats a bit of evidence
PurplePillDebate,removed,your view isnt incompatible with trp trpers would probably agree that women can afford to be choosy if your view was instead something like this doesnt cause women to have an over inflated sense of their own smv or this doesnt have ramifications when it comes to what women expect from a noncasual partner then id have a go at cyv
PurplePillDebate,removed,so true then men can be choosey when they are at their sexual peak while woman are looking to settle down or have to because they cant rope the hawt guys they used to trp calls this enjoying the decline ever heard of the grasshopper and the ants winter approaches in as much as a womans eggs get old but she still needs that sweet sweet comfort can she lock that beta cock down probably but she wont be happy spent all her excitement coins on the cc women can afford to be choosey with casual jeff goldblum in jurassic park your feminist were so preoccupied with whether they could that they didnt stop to think if they should
PurplePillDebate,removed,i still cant tell if trp is annoyed women are not as interested in casual sex or not because on the one hand if they are omg sluts on the one hand if they are not omg women are stupid cows who do not understand how important sex is to us
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do it states everything and nothing because it is bullshit its not complicated yet too complicated for you to get a basic grasp of and make a post where you dont sound like you stumbled upon rp yesterday pathetic
PurplePillDebate,removed,only dumb white thots fuck black guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,into the oven with you then
PurplePillDebate,removed,but ethno nationalism in usa is not a viable option if the us becomes majority nonwhite it will be inevitable white people arent going to want to carry a bunch of low iq minorities asses forever we will no longer be the greatest country in the world if we are no longer majority white the lower iq hispanic population set to overtake us is not going to carry the mantle of western civilization just not feasible even among whites what would count people can get really autistic about this but i would just say anyone with indigenous european ancestry globalism is making it less likely by the day in case you havent noticed theres a huge backlash against globalism brexit trump and globalisms reign is no longer assured
PurplePillDebate,removed,not everyone is you
PurplePillDebate,removed,sorry but youre an idiot by definition if you have a girlfriend youre not celibate unless you choose to be celibate what i said about most women rejecting me whatever i do is simply a fact it will be a fact for you too

PurplePillDebate,removed,a bmi of is borderline anorexic nope youre just fucking stupid im at a bmi of but ive also been taking steroids and bulking up for a while while being decently into fitness for the past years or so occasional lapses and consistently weight lifting for the past years the only time a woman should be above a is she too is taking steroids and trying to bulk up for the average woman that has zero physical activity that doesnt involve lifting a psl up to her mouth is fine the fact that you try to argue this is proof of how far off average is
PurplePillDebate,removed,if women cant truly love a man in the same way that a man loves a woman and if women use their looks to deceive and manipulate men into loving them only to break their heart and wallet while showing no remorse or guilt then why do women continually insist upon finding the right guyall men are douchebags its not the same people who do these things tbh i have many friends who ruthlessly and remorselessly use men for their money i have never heard a single one of them say all men are douchebags the women who do this the bitches they do not have trouble securing commitment theyre great at it and at getting men to spend inordinate amounts of on them the girls who are saying men are douchebags are a different category of women theyre the women who are getting screwed over by men because theyre kind and genuine and the men theyre sleeping with are not not all women are the same women often behave in very different ways and peoples level of empathy varies tbh there was a time in my life when i was very hurt and i wanted to screw men over as badly as possible post sexual assault i decided that all men were awful douchebags and so i could fuck them over with impunity ive gotten over that i think a lot of rpers are angry like thishave generalized women like this so that they can do the exact same thing soyou know based on my past behavior i get the urge to lash out i did terrible terrible things to people used them for money broke their hearts dumped them unceremoniously ruined their social standing looking back i am so ashamed but at the time i certainly didnt feel remorse i generally have a great sense of empathy but during this time in my life i didnt i wanted to make the people around me hurt i wasnt complaining about finding the right guy i gave no fucks just like my lady friends who are hurt lashing out now give fucks
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am new here but it seems people denying rp dont actually know what it is they only know the negative anger of some posters or the political beliefs of some posters ill make it easy for the men and women on here that are not given a good explanation its very simple actually the entire foundation of rp and why it works has to do with base hind brain instinct which is responsible for male and female arousal female arousal just like in all high animals has to do with the male proving his genetics are good enough for females to risk potentially costly life threatening pregnancy and producing healthy strong children that will survive it is all instinct folks and it evolved to this we are the relatives of these cave men and cave women rp tactics are about triggering these primal instincts in females if the guy is not honest it is a powerful dark tool if the male actually wants a long term relationship and children he can secure his family unit with out the dangers of divorce if he is on his game so what is it how does it work simply put it is making the woman who finds you at least moderately physically attractive feel safe with you you trigger the primal feminine requirement of safety which in turn triggers primal mating instinct now evolution has given women another primal instinct to make sure what she is feeling toward him is actually legit its basically i feel safe nowbut can he continue to make me feel this way enter the shit test women do it constantly with out knowing it its primal she will say things like you only want me for sex or do you think shes attractive how these are answered tells her hind brain if you are fit enough to pass your genes so there you have it folks at its core its making women feel instinctively safe which in turn triggers mating instinct with a man she finds at least moderately attractive physically
PurplePillDebate,removed,eurasiantiger
PurplePillDebate,removed,sometimes people are so patently stupid that they realize theyve backed themselves into a corner and cant muster an argument this seems to be one of those times
PurplePillDebate,removed,none of them actually tried trp and failed they just found it icky likely closet homosexuals none have found any success with an alternate method
PurplePillDebate,removed,only person ive seen you expose is yourself is it within the rules to keep pointing out what a spineless loser virgin and overall embarrassment of a man you are
PurplePillDebate,removed,mbti is based on the work of karl jung who was way smarter than you sure you cant read too much into it otherwise things get silly but its a useful tool for selfexamination

PurplePillDebate,removed,here comes another bp innocent
PurplePillDebate,removed,because i wanted to call out the obvious strawman and wreck you lol youre such a warrior look if you actually talk to rp guys like i do you get the opposite they do this to get laid they repeatedly say that trp is a sexual strategy sub period how many threads do you see on ppd about trp works gets guys laid therefore it is right all the threads so it sounds like your message is not getting received in other words you are wrong brave samurai

PurplePillDebate,removed,im afraid your testimony alone is insufficient ill have to inspect your vagina personally to confirm the veracity of your statement
PurplePillDebate,removed,they write their own parody but thats what rtbp is right parody and satire not to ever be taken seriously
PurplePillDebate,removed,lmfao you are so fucking hilarious and dont even realize it
PurplePillDebate,removed,why cant anyone ever believe someone isnt on the left because they actually believe in nonleftist ideas and philosophies the greatest irony ive seen on ppd is that this is coming from you lol you really still dont see why
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you never saw it you clearly werent looking or are a blinded feminist
PurplePillDebate,removed,this woman says stuff like remember women find of men unfuckable why am i not allowed to laugh at her
PurplePillDebate,removed,jpwhoregan already did that for that exact reason rpillscollide
PurplePillDebate,removed,the real difference is women in the congo have real problems whereas women in the us are cry baby bitches
PurplePillDebate,removed,these are made up numbers based on a definition of rape that passes muster only in the private fantasies of fat ugly feminists
PurplePillDebate,removed,redpill essentially puts on blast the truths they tell alphas to the orbiting betas who are supposed to be kept in the dark
PurplePillDebate,removed,sources for what currently the chinese might be they just might be
PurplePillDebate,removed,until you can change the view the discussion is ended
PurplePillDebate,removed,the earth revolves around the sun sources please

PurplePillDebate,removed,shocking i know
PurplePillDebate,removed,bingo if you found anything at all about him attractive suddenly its a alpha trait
PurplePillDebate,removed,source his ass and screaming insecurity
PurplePillDebate,removed,true
PurplePillDebate,removed,attraction
PurplePillDebate,removed,one fat fetishist female attractiveness and the male perception thereof cannot meaningfully be described as factual or objective this is the most naive statement made in this thread to date fetishes by their very definition are anomalies of sexual norms you are literally using an anomalies to justify a false norm based off of your naive narratives i mean you cannot even commit a greater error of statistics anomalies exist in every system even nature they are so few and so far between that by their scientific definition they are discarded i mean ffs anyone who has done even a single course in any kind of stem or science field will tell you this but instead of understanding that nuance and perhaps informing your naive perspective you instead put on your white knight hat and decided to go on a dribbling rampage and not even make sense so calm yer tits there little one no one here is abusing your wommenz so you can put that white knight lance away your woman there was using a single case of an anomaly to try to prove a norm i showed her to be false she then tried to hamster the conversation away and tried to backtrack i prevented her doing so and called her out no one is getting abused here and no womens rights are being tramped on so you can put your sjw nonsense away its completely unnecessary people are so quick to defend their flawed narratives that they dont even bother to read sheesh
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont necessarily disagree with the ideas you have put forward themselves but feminists are some of the most cowardly people i have ever encountered respect for women is definitely a virtue so go out and teach people in areas where misogyny is utterly rife about respecting women rather than preaching this to the already converted
PurplePillDebate,removed,best antisjw statements are of course chics in good times
PurplePillDebate,removed,congratulations you win the strawman of the week award also nice waaaa its not my fault you got there
PurplePillDebate,removed,like most leftist issues in gender politics only men are singled out
PurplePillDebate,removed,its like catcalling there was this feminist rage against catcalling for a while until feminists realized it was rarely white guys and they would have to involve black and latino cultures in their attack now you never hear about catcalling because a good feminist only attacks white males
PurplePillDebate,removed,says the guy who cant read a dictionary
PurplePillDebate,removed,awww did we hurt your feefees

PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre just finding an excuse to attack me now in such a dishonest way as revenge cuz youre butthurt ok im not interested in further exchange with you
PurplePillDebate,removed,shes looking to remove red flaired users because its easier than forming arguments
PurplePillDebate,removed,what the hell man

PurplePillDebate,removed,shhh youre going to wake the cognitive dissonance
PurplePillDebate,removed,nailed it
PurplePillDebate,removed,okay ive seen your type its common around military bases you lead men to believe that you love them while never stating it explicitly lots of money in that good job
PurplePillDebate,removed,well youre on a debate forum and im basically explaining that youre full of shit stick to trp if you dont want your vapid bullshit scrutinised
PurplePillDebate,removed,would you randomly attack people on the street with personal insults about their weight or body then why do you think its okay to do that online what difference would it make anyway it has a higher chance of encouraging suicide than encouraging them to lose weight so again if you dont have anything nice to say shut the fuck up
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont forget to cup his balls while youre down there
PurplePillDebate,removed,is there a luxury tax on them no dont take anything she says in this too seriously shes made it obvious she isnt informed although apparently the tax on these in the uk is enough to prevent girls from going to school according to her yeah
PurplePillDebate,removed,im in agreement with op most women in society can look as good if not better than many many porn starts they just have to lose weightdress more feminine and most cantwont do that the double d hyper attractive porn star is out the common youthful thin average amateur girl next door porn is very very popular men seek out that type of porn because american women have let themselves go with donuts ice cream sugary cocktails and laziness the only porn conditioning thats real is the sensitivity issue too much masturbation in general can make it harder to cum with a real women
PurplePillDebate,removed,in my experience the vast majority of level headed woman dont give a shit about porn and accept it as part of modern life why are you so focused on the minority you obviously clash with thats just a recipe for a bitter man
PurplePillDebate,removed,people like you are the reason why ive attempted suicide thanks for the demo
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not true in any country i was able to find according to op it is true in australia yeah but shes lyingmisinformed she claimed a luxury tax when in fact its the regular sales tax thing is even if i give op benefit of the doubt on this the vast majority of the complaining about the socalled tampon tax still comes from the us and uk which have no such thing i think it was a very deliberate effort to only refer to this as a tampon tax rather than a sales tax that also applies to tampons that has convinced many women that there is a special tax on tampons case in point ops link is from a british newspaper i already explained how in the uk tampons are simply taxed just like any other sanitary product yeah she wont listen been there done that even that isnt true tampons like any other sanitary product have a lower rate of vat only vs for regular items do you think facts matter to these people going by what umisgenderedcactus said there is a similar situation in the us in most states sanitary products get a low rate of sales tax yep its still called a special luxury tax on tampons yep the media wilfully misrepresents this issue to push an agenda its damned effective i suspect wombat here will go to her grave convinced theres a super secret tax on tampons used to keep women poor under the patriarchy
PurplePillDebate,removed,no you edited it three times lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes im not going down on a hairy coochie
PurplePillDebate,removed,i bet their clits alone are bigger than your whole set
PurplePillDebate,removed,as long as they dont become dreads its okay as a teen i had more problems with it but then i fucked some milfs and stonerhippie chicks and now i must admit that i like some hair better than no hairs but another factor is that some chicks try to pass themselves off as although they only look like but then turn out to be and so a completely shaven body always gives me that visceral eww thats a kid reaction
PurplePillDebate,removed,my husband prefers my pubic hair natural another guy i dated did as well that being said i get very stubbly very quickly so it isnt worth it for me
PurplePillDebate,removed,legs armpits i dont care whatever weirdly armpits quick me out though i can rationalize leg hair as fuzzy and soft and crotch hair as adult but armpits are just nasty they hair they make it all dry and nanngly and just gross in general
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont have to speculate its happened all the time or was this an attempt to have bloopers soapbox about how much they hate trp and generally pretend like we give a fuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,as to i dont know but i have an answer to much more pressing question here do you think you could make her cum if given a few brief seconds of access to her holes to which my answer is a resounding yes my four finger whirlwind technique would get her off so hard shed be unable to stand let alone continue the concert her only recourse would be to invite me backstage where i would fuck her thoroughly and without mercy
PurplePillDebate,removed,to them feminists are angry antisex antiman creatures xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,sometimes i read such ridiculous claims on the red pill guys who claim they do not eat pussy because it is humiliating but make the girl choke on their cock instead i dont know what kind of broken human beings they are with but i would never tolerate a crappy sex life and a man has to get me off with cunnilingus before he even gets penetration from me in general i can orgasm with a dildo and some good erotica as well so i totally believe that the more men ask for crazy things the less sex they will get
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh man comedy gold youve made my week here have an upvote just for being so ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,removed,no you dont you just laugh so you dont cry
PurplePillDebate,removed,too bad youre a ugly fat ass post wall bitch
PurplePillDebate,removed,take a logic course and you will be able to process my comment correctly
PurplePillDebate,removed,sure lets say we can rate physical attractiveness on a scale from what you view as a i might view as and visversa the whole competition aspect is flawed because it assumes all men will rate women the same and that all men will get the same rating all beautiful black women ar ebeautiful because they approach the rations irrespective of black fewer black women approach the ratios bro what the fuck are talking about i cant even understand what this means
PurplePillDebate,removed,well you have had sex yes do you move your body so with a big dick you can move your body to stimulate yourself more then with someone who has a micro penis and if youre a starfish well then
PurplePillDebate,removed,its part of a mans nature to protect women so please explain africa india the middle east etc whats with the obscene rape culture everywhere else in the world
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol a dick can rub the clit a dick can rub the g spot the a spot sorry do you know how to sex
PurplePillDebate,removed,no if youre a dude you must have a small pee pee a dude who has no idea what hes doing with a x inch dick is more likely to satisfy then a
PurplePillDebate,removed,hello woman there are positions where the shaft of the penis puts pressure right on your clit and with every thrust it gives it a nice tug therefore acting as clitoral stimulation my apologies you have had sub par lovers who dont know how to use their dick what benefit does a small dick have which means nothing lower then what inches because i have a inch dick and some positions extra length would really come in handy sure maybe if all you do is missionary then girl on top then doggy and some minor variations it doesnt matter but when you start doing fucked up positions the size comes in big like shit even against a wall standing wearing your red dress slide your panties to the side a small dick inches will feel like inches because of the angle of insertion man id hate to have a small dick it would make sex subpar i mean i slip out hard in some positions if i was smaller there would be many positions i cant even do and many that would diminish my satisfaction though giving the girl some im an expert i give alot of dick
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre one of the reasons many girls wont put out on the first date even if they want to asshole
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont tell me not to jaywalk tell them not to run over me thats feminist logic they dont want personal responsibility they want to be children with no agency at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats because of how thirsty most men are i have seen alpha males hit on chicks so fat they couldnt get off the couch but thats because the hot girls were already with other guys

PurplePillDebate,removed,lol its cute how important you think this is since youre such a good debater why dont you talk about something important and not the silliness here why dont you speak on the oil crisis or immigration laws
PurplePillDebate,removed,because shes a feminist xd feminism iz evil lel
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is definitely a trend on trp and reddit overall where people are either seen in blackwhite beta or alpha a complete loser or chad
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree with your assessment trp has a very distorted view of an average male they picture them as nerdy and helpless socially these are actually a minority irl they just are a majority on reddit average men have no problem getting laid
PurplePillDebate,removed,keep hampstering like a bitch
PurplePillDebate,removed,when i was single i used to go to these over dances so my test group is postwall which might make a difference regardless i dont think i ever once asked a woman to dance there they all asked me and i danced a lot
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol so no anecdotes to tell me why im wrong just use anecdotes if you agree with me and tell me why im right
PurplePillDebate,removed,not a woman but ive been approached quite often sometimes aggressively
PurplePillDebate,removed,that said i prefer to be chased because i find that it affirms a mans sense of masculinity men prefer this at least the ones i like do they dont like gender roles to be subverted even if they think they do ive heard this before and cant believe people actually think like this jesus christ as humans we all derive pleasure out of being wanted its not gender specific no socially constructed idea asserting that men like to do the chasing and are thereby masculine wtf and dont like to indulge in being lazy and have things fall into their lap can contest the fact that we all love to be chased feel good chemicals in the brain go off over it any man that seriously believes he has to chase or otherwise is not a man has been brainwashed and cannot think for himself noone gives a fuck about gender roles being subverted you know who do women because it serves them its like you women convince yourself of certain things and then apparently it becomes reality similarly if i buy a dude heaps of chocolate and jewelry and totally spoil him he usually begins to wonder whats wrong with me omg well men arent that into jewellery its not a gender role its about taste dating is all just one extremely long tease the whole thing is foreplay get close pull back get close pull back the trick is to never pull back too far or to smother a build up can be good but truth be told no youre just protecting yourself from being shut down and youre caught up in your head too much casual sex that happens fairly quickly and from either end can be just as hot as any gameplan sex
PurplePillDebate,removed,how many of these women like yourself translate your words into political action i posit the silent majority who is really against these antimen measures if they even exist at all ultimately doesnt matter
PurplePillDebate,removed,men are dumb and believe women when women say looks dont matter so they will chase after the best looking and sociable women thinking that he can seduce her with game or personality when reality hits them in the face they become angry and bitter they will stay that way as long as they have the blue pill shoved up their ass
PurplePillDebate,removed,well youre an idiot and if you have kids youre also pretty selfish
PurplePillDebate,removed,because i got weirdly enamoured with one dick fortunately for you thatll wear off in time remindme days lollygagyos got a new dick
PurplePillDebate,removed,why did you downvote then tho lol i wasnt arguing with you no i dont think all women below the age of are cunts but if you already think that its highly unlikely that i can change your ridiculous view que sera
PurplePillDebate,removed,i said those cunts can go fuck themselves i didnt say theyre all cunts learn what sweeping generalizations are first dear and saying que sera over and over makes you look like more of a cocksucker than you already are this is all very ironic seeing as how you made a point to me that you arent surprised at how much people care about this dumb shityet you seem to care a great deal about what someone you dont agree with is saying oh well que sera
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont have an agenda as you do i am calling women cunts and i guess you dont like that find i dont care but what youre telling me is youre not a cocksucker i find that hard to believe how could someone who has been with so many men not sucked so many cocks sometimes truths are insults to the person interpreting them
PurplePillDebate,removed,not necessarily why the use of this phrase i didnt think you sexually liberated women found it bad in the slightest and i guarantee youre putting far more thought into this conversation than i am cupcake its really entertaining to me how easily offended independent women get even by the opinions of those whose opinions they claim to not care about in the slightest trust me im taking you about as seriously as i take any other early twenties beenaroundtheblock female
PurplePillDebate,removed,unnecessarily passive aggressive this was admitted a while ago but whether its unnecessary is up for debate it is to me but you are being the same because you dont like my opinions which is fine i find it funny though you girls seem to really like feeling different from all the other vapid cunts and you make a big effort to say youre different yet you just mentally lumped yourself in with all the rest i dont think the problem is my opinion of vapid loose girls under i think the problem is you lump yourself in with them i cant change your opinion of yourself im sorry you feel that way about yourself maybe get some counseling also ironic to differentiate yourself you fell back on the manchild insult and then wonder why men like me dont take you people seriously if someone elses opinions rustles your jimmies this much maybe you shouldnt do things to cause others to have this opinion of you its no more obvious that you are having any more fun with this conversation than me and i dont find manchild to be insulting i long for the days of being a child again simpler times its not my fault you have doubts about your future because of your past i actually believe you feel that you should be concerned about your actions but maybe im giving you too much credit maybe you have disillusioned yourself into thinking youll become well adjusted later in life who knows
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow dunningkruger used your ass for a handpuppet there i know attention spans are bad but did you forget the lack of financial independencemarital rape combo already oh and how did the good men of the past behave when first told to wash their hands do you want to call a mulligan
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah i used to post on that forum when i first found reddit i quickly realized that it was so easy to have the top post with tons of karma by giving cookie cutter bs feel good advice nobody thinks that hard about the situations and pretty much says what feels nice to say
PurplePillDebate,removed,absolutely yesterday there was agreement that a guy needs to fight knife armed robbers and the other guys have knives you are dead son prepare for burial imbeciles the whole lot
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah that sub is a joke its too easy to teel people over the internet to break up you cant resist the temptation you cant care enough to want to try to really understand their situation you cant really understand what going un in that relationship even if you wanted it its too complicated
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree with number if they wanna have plates they shouldnt expect the plates to have neverending loyalty to them
PurplePillDebate,removed,im guessing that means anus so youre saying men are assholes i concur good day
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont care youre a douche pretending to be a moral authority keep signalling to the women how youre this great white knight surely one will touch your dick we are building men there youre building nothing
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you add or copypaste some more detail about the articlestudy so its easier for people here thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,submitted hours ago by devilishrogue the advice offered is rarely in the best interests of op and normally an idealised form of the morals and value of the young and ignorant reddit userbase about what they feel should happen in the described circumstances utterly nailed it no one is allowed to be less than perfect if they are the absent subject of an r relationships post
PurplePillDebate,removed,mos def
PurplePillDebate,removed,ugh read the fucking post you moron third paragraph mods can this be deleted since its kind of gross and literally adds nothing to the discussion as i addressed this in my post as specifically off topic
PurplePillDebate,removed,why do blue pillers always make everything about the poster and never about the argument thats a lazy way to avoid accepting the truth dude
PurplePillDebate,removed,it triggers red pill men and its funny
PurplePillDebate,removed,wanna give me your number
PurplePillDebate,removed,imagine if you turned that obsessive nature into something positive like an eating disorder you could get not obese and maybe a boyfriend
PurplePillDebate,removed,who gives a shit if its fun it will get guys to like you
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats the view from inside the bubble after youve swallowed the red pill
PurplePillDebate,removed,i liked how they chronicled that retarded ciswhite drama thing when it happened
PurplePillDebate,removed,its objectively bad advice and completely full of shit if youre at all as civilized as you want to be youll adjust soon enough if not youll continue to lawyer up
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow thats a lot of straw you should take your creative writing talent to rwritingprompts
PurplePillDebate,removed,and here comes the poor wee man afraid of getting cucked sweetheart if you cannot please a woman longterm it does not mean all other men in ltrs cannot
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats not shaming thats responding to your trolling question
PurplePillDebate,removed,you live in a world where nobody has heard the words beta cucks coming from the manosphere thats cute no its time for you to present the slightest proof of your claims instead of derailing the conversation stay focused and make your case for an alpha fucks and beta bucks as understood by trp
PurplePillDebate,removed,is that the solution sweet heart i thought the solution was i should only bang women who are in ltr as an added bonus if she gets pregnant she can tell the bf its his as an added bonus when i get tired of her blabbing i send her back to her bf i do have a fascination for lady lawyers they usually are machiavellian and fun to talk to unlike most women are you a lady lawyer
PurplePillDebate,removed,great counter argument im sure itll play well with your audience did you actually have anything to back it up
PurplePillDebate,removed,again i want to hear you explain the spread of trps afbb cuckold fantasies and how you think turning them into all purpose insults for the altright isnt shaming men are you even capable of defending anything youve claimed or is your hand so weak that if you back off the attack for even a moment everyone will see it either way its irrelevant at this point youve had every chance to stop playing stupid and actually make a case
PurplePillDebate,removed,so how did happen beta uprising thats what happens when you tell people at risk for violence that nobody gives a shit whether they live or die and those who bully them are the only ones anyone can actually be attracted to youre not a harmless fantasy
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol youve been letting ugeekyfeministdork troll ppd for the past hours and youre telling off other users for not being civil haha this is shitty moderation
PurplePillDebate,removed,username checks out
PurplePillDebate,removed,bye bye then unbiased mod
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbh theres no good way to reject someone and theres no good way to get rejected maybe look i dont like rejecting guys because i dont wanna hurt anyone but i cant force myself to feel attraction towards someone i know its hard to approach girls because girls usually dont approach guys and i know girls arent as attracted to guys as guys are to girls which has root in evolutionary biology but i cant really offer anything besides friendship and even offering friendship is hard because i dont wanna lead you on and think theres a chance for more girls are shallow and terrible but thats our nature i dont like it any more than you do
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one can be objectively creepy the behaviours looks and attitudes that make an individual creepy are dependent on the person in this context the person we are going to be talking about is a woman translation everything that a man says does or believes in is creepy women are neardivine super beings who are never wrong and every male is just a potential rapist
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol calm down there trigglypuff im not suggesting playing matchmaker or something all im saying is if you happen to notice throughout the night a girl checking out the guy you rejected let him know someone was checking him out after that its all on him just a nice gesture since most guys suck at reading non verbal communication if nobody is checking him out that you notice no big deal but just the offer to let him know shows somebody cares enough and he has value is that such a bad thing to show even if its a stranger i do find it funny how you think its horrendous to even attempt to set up a single girlfriend unless she gives you express permission no one is telling you to hit on your friend for a stranger or anything but just pointing out that guy over in the corner is cute and has been checking out your friend that constitutes as a friendship ending action and im no niceguy tm i never said women need my protection or drinks but if some aggressive asshole wont take a hint a bouncer or friend group isnt around and you feel unsafe perhaps that guy you rejected nicely and offered to help could be of some assistance if you want it and ive only rejected one girl before due to being in a relationship but i followed the advice i posted above i pointed out a lonely looking guy across the way they started chatting and i went back to chatting with my friend group later on a beer was placed in front on me when i didnt order it i asked from who and the bartender pointed out the same girl she was dancing with the guy both looking happy as could be and she waved and mouthed thank you i thought it was a classy and nice gesture figured i could flip the genders and use that as a mini incentive but way to name call lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,all in the hopes that he doesnt let me get raped remember kids all men are rapists
PurplePillDebate,removed,this post reeks of virtue signalling what are you really trying to sayget people to say
PurplePillDebate,removed,you dont need to do anything you can be a stuck up bitch and nuclear reject any non male model that dares say hi based on how your taking my innocuous comment it appears that you would prefer to do that then why ask the question in the first place if you dont want others viewpoints all i was trying to convey is its a potential nice gesture to let a guy that you rejected know if someone finds him attractive and mentions it to youyou notice it throughout the night if you dont notice anyone no big deal men tend to suck at reading body language so someone more fluent in said communication style could be beneficial all in all its just a nice gesture i did once that turned out well and scored me a free beer lol who doesnt like a free drink and of course i would help someone out getting harrassed regardless if there isnt some reward for myself when did i say i wouldnt and why do you assume the guy is a creep cause he isnt a chad
PurplePillDebate,removed,hi heres a summary of the term strawman a httprationalwikiorgwikistrawman is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater httprationalwikiorgwikiredherring their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance while their argument would still be fallacious they can be at least
PurplePillDebate,removed,removed if you want this to be a discussion post dont include an affirmative claim in your tile please repost with a title that describes the issue or your view wout stating it explicitly
PurplePillDebate,removed,we aint gotta pay yall shit xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,uh oh here comes the crybaby

PurplePillDebate,removed,i get it youre in denial im sure its very comforting to tell yourself that super hot girl over there isnt natural and must rely on makeup and other things to attain her beauty but its simply not always true life isnt fair natural beauty exists not everyone has to apply makeup to look good even though you do
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol the cunts hating on you

PurplePillDebate,removed,muh dark triad
PurplePillDebate,removed,i had an ltr do lesbian porn without discussing it with me the kicker is we did discuss a threesome and were looking online for an appropriate girl i rejected all of her suggestions because they were not as good looking as her and she rejected all my suggestions because they were better looking than her she was a at best maybe this would not have been a problem if she was an so she went off and did lesbian porn and when i found out that ended the relationship and now it is preserved for all posterity on the internet google amateurcanadafrancis and there you go
PurplePillDebate,removed,yawn
PurplePillDebate,removed,the whole topic is also hypocritical as fuck since women are happily allowed to complain about men only wanting sex a fuckzoned woman can rant all day about the particular man andor men in general without anyone shouting them down making memes against them or creating subreddits against them
PurplePillDebate,removed,or not fuck a smelly fat girl just hand over your resources as you prostrate yourself in front of the alter of feminism
PurplePillDebate,removed,perhaps youd rather that people werent nice to you then perhaps youd prefer that no one extend you common courtesy then fine when i see you ill just say fuck off and be on my way

PurplePillDebate,removed,i genuinely think you all live in a mentally ill fantasy world
PurplePillDebate,removed,rtheredpill a place where men belittle women being interested in and talking about men all the while being interested in and talking about women
PurplePillDebate,removed,dude this is and i use this word very rarely retarded
PurplePillDebate,removed,high waisted jeans require a woman to be fitter too its another measure of performance and value this is incorrect high waisted jeans primarily service to visually balance a petite womans frame to appear taller the trend itself can be worn by all shapes but a pear – which is well known to be the classic female shape for thousands of years you wouldnt know this of course because you are making stuff up as you go obviously i disagree if women didnt want to attract men they wouldnt bother with beauty or fashion and wouldnt bother cooking for men either obviously youre a misogynistic idiot pull your head out of your ass dude would it make you believe it more if i cited books lol youd have to read them first alpha lifting them only helps your muscles
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah unfortunately its true theres no justice for degenerates in this world now in the next maybeone can dream
PurplePillDebate,removed,virginity isnt a turn off for women thats something men made up it just so happens that a lot of guys who are virgins by their mid arent very attractive but being a virgin in itself isnt unattractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,good fucking thread man this is exactly the explanation i needed its similar to an old thread of mine currently one of the top posts of all time about people saying nice guys are secretly assholes to rationalize their disgust towards them you are absolutely right i act more entitled to women and sex now and its only helped me i dont know where tbp got the idea that being entitled will hurt your chances with women anyways acting nice and not entitled got me taken advantage of saving this one in case a feminist tries to be cheeky with that nice guys are entitled but still be nice bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean someone did end up with m not sure who that person is
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive said it a thousand times tbp is satire sub it exsists soley to make fun of trp to us trp is a dancing monkey you do stupid shit and get yourselves into stupid situations and we laugh at you if you are advocating to hurt people we will tell you to stop in the same way you would tell the dancing monkey to stop biting people trp is the one that focuses on stopping the spread of feminism and all that shit so who are you to really talk but really the most important thing to remember is this dance monkey dance
PurplePillDebate,removed,in all seriousness the sluts are usually just high smv and attractive women most likely fun too so ofc they are going to end up with a high value man high value men tend to look for fun since they are more often in the position to go for someone like that
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbpfeminism is definitely anti freespeech they even invented a derisive mocking term for it freeze peach clever lil devils they are
PurplePillDebate,removed,no i wasnt stating the obvious if i wanted to state the obvious id call you a pitiable misogynist
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats it little monkey dance for me
PurplePillDebate,removed,keep on dancing monkey we are all enjoying it
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah pemfagbabyliar knows better not only does he live in a whole other area he is also has a wealth of experience like idk a failed marriage and showing over and over that he is full of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,agreed how do i downvote op to a negative bajillion
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats the music you dance to
PurplePillDebate,removed,i just want to say i find your comments appalling what youre saying is nothing new though i have read on other forums how men talk about women and its all game commentsadvice like this to actually think of women like actually perceive them as mere objects is deeply saddening we are human beings with emotions and feelings i feel bad for all the nice genuine girls who get pumped and dumped when they thought maybe down the road a relationship might come about and maybe they had sex in the moment and were feeling it then the guy disappears men and women view sex very differently generally speaking did your mother raise you to treat women this way how would she feel about the way you so nonchalantly talk about pumping and dumping you clearly do not respect women just because a woman is not up to your attractiveness standards doesnt give you the right to treat her like garbage where is the humanity its gone with a lot of these immature insecure men
PurplePillDebate,removed,exactly what youre talking about ive seen it ive been on the receiving end of it a womans reaction to a chad is quite different from her reactions to men shes not attracted to or even to her husband cuck confirmed thats called basic flirting those are just signs of arousal youve never made a woman aroused before
PurplePillDebate,removed,academic level sources also believe in supply and demand just stop with your elitism my source is from college yourse is just from high school also a fucking lie you need to learn how to debate properly with your false adhominems that you have been spewing since your first post seriously ive been way more cordial to you in this you sound like a fucking nimrod
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know exactly what youre talking about ive seen it ive been on the receiving end of it seriously weve been talking about this in irc for hours no one will call him out on claiming to be chad when he cant even get his wife to fuck him
PurplePillDebate,removed,some people have higher needs than others sometimes you need a lot more income to solve certain problems or issues
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,they could still have their own hobbies and freedom cut your bullshit
PurplePillDebate,removed,very wrong on your part no true scotsman isnt a defense for being completely misinformed about a topic hah thats what you tried not i there is no where that feminism is truly defined for example some believe in using laws and quotas to make the number of women in certain professions the same as men others believe in simply letting women choose where they want to work and are against quotas some feminists are very pro abortion others say it hurts women and are very against it you are very wrong please think before you speak
PurplePillDebate,removed,wrong again please tell me about these definitions sarcasm in reality there is no official definition of feminism it can change from person to person nice try baby
PurplePillDebate,removed,as i said feminism is a broad movement umm that was my point and you are saying im wrong your characterization doesnt fall into it in any way shape or form because you get your information from misinformed antifeminists and as a result are misinformed yourself so now you go back to your true scotsman argument very contradictory please tell me the specific ways my assumption are wrong i state my observations and thoughts and you claim them to be wrongyou are terrible at discussion
PurplePillDebate,removed,your observations are wrong inherently anecdotal observations cannot be wrong they are an own persons thoughts and yet if you tried to claim that they believe the sky is purple youd be wrong but also right the sky can be purple get better sources and then youll make more accurate statements its really that simple ummthese are personal observations we have gone over this many times there is no official book defining specific things on what feminism is or is not please show me what true feminists is defined as then you obviously cannot it is subjective
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have observed it is hard for you to restrain yourself from bitchranting under every comment which randomly catches your fancy still you look like an even bigger fool than usual if you do not do your red pill research before talking
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant change ur view cuz i agree with it i dont think society should focus so hard on flushing the johns cuz hoes are always going to exist
PurplePillDebate,removed,its worthwhile for allowing women to go topless when men can girl theres a difference between a mans chest and a womans big hanging titties xd come on now its a bit annoying the way everyone treats menstrual blood as the most vile thing in the world yea boo hoo now if you consider these things issues of the world that are more important than the shit women in third world countries go through something is wrong yall keep using wah we have our problems tooooo as a copout so you can keep worrying about yourselves and not pay attention to them women in the middle east and india that are suffering real problems its not a serious issue that i cant walk outside with my titties hanging out all over the place its not a serious issue that i cant let my period blood run down my legs and drip all on the sidewalk because men think its nasty when women think its just as nasty those arent even minor issues that women think about but you know whats an issue getting your face blown off for not wearing a hijab fearing going outside because of rape committing suicide to escape the rape thats coming because men are that undisciplined if you wanna see a real issue if you want something legit to cry about look at that while youre crying because the world doesnt want to see your sagging hanging titties
PurplePillDebate,removed,fucking exactly boo fucking hoo
PurplePillDebate,removed,get the fuck outta here

PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant challenge your view because i think this is entirely correct im sure ive done this i think youre stating it a bit strongly to say most men here struggle because of this but i think its something that people here are prone to doing myself included
PurplePillDebate,removed,please dont attempt to logically rationalize what is literally sociopathy yea i know people overuse the term but this is a case where its literally warranted game isnt ludacris he isnt a rapper that projects a hardcore image that motherfucker has been in serious gangs they have guns lots of them not for hunting deer so please before you waste my your time with your selfrighteous correction stop i think to yourself does what im saying actually make sense or does this make resemble a horsesass

PurplePillDebate,removed,what kind of autistic argument is this xd since when is sex on the same level as emotional care
PurplePillDebate,removed,so feminism as a whole believes men are not entitled to sex from women this is one of the things that make friendzoned nice guys bitter with women that after months or years of using him for validation attention and favors she slaps him with you are not owed sex for anything being nice doesnt entitle you to my body meanwhile shes rightswiping on tinder or going to the club and sleeping with men she met within hours feminists should never claim that a woman is entitled to emotional support and attention from men they hookup with from a red pill perspective women use beta nice guys for attentionemotional support while getting her sexual needs met by alpha chad she wants the attentionemotional support from chad but since hes generally selfish and only wants sex from her she turns to the beta for emotional support therefore women almost never get attention emotional support and sex from the same man they hookup with that only happens in an ltr or fwb the whole men are not entitled to sex from women line is reserved only for beta men who want to date women who are not attracted to them

PurplePillDebate,removed,in some instances sexism and misogyny are mutually exclusive an employer at a construction company can choose to hire a man over a woman based entirely on sex but not hate women because of it he knows the man will get the job done with fewer issues and would likely give the woman an office job and not all men considered sexist or misogynist identifies with the red pill though they tend to hold the same perspectives as it relates to bp vs rp what bp calls sexism and misogyny in rp is a shallow blanket term in response to red pill perspectives for how women operate before the red pill we were all blue pill in a sense meaning in the spirit of courtesy and respect we took women at their word and trusted that they cared about our best interests as we did about theirs and it appeared to work out fairly well until men started noticing that women werent doing what they were saying that they said they wanted men who treated them with respect but were dating jerkishtype men who just pumped and dumped them that they said looks dont matter its whats on the inside that counts but were consistently dating tall brawny muscular men that they were slutting it up with dozens of men in the prime of their youth and expecting the good men that they rejected to provide for them when they were no longer wanted by the alphas that they were divorceraping and marrying up and filing false rape allegations and blackmailing men for resources or position by threatening them with harassment complaints or domestic violence allegations and many men were burned by it all so when these men started calling women out for their actions and how men were screwed over in the process and explaining to other men httpsillimitablemencomarchivesunderstandingtheredpillredpillconstitution to help other men avoid pitfalls and better themselves they were called sexists and misogynists then blue pillers who havent experienced the pain of the above factors to a deep degree would find red pill posts with some men expressing anger and call trp sexist and misogynistic as a whole without acknowledging that trp helps men
PurplePillDebate,removed,fag
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are a power tripping faggot
PurplePillDebate,removed,wtf
PurplePillDebate,removed,do you send dms to women saying that if they shitted in your hand youd clap and youd drag your balls through broken glass and rosie odonnells armpit sweat to lick their ass lolololololololol
PurplePillDebate,removed,we require all posts to have text sufficient to explain any linked materials can you pull out some relevant paragraphs from the article and add to your op this will make it easier for users here
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont understand why twerps are so goddamn black and white on this they head a feeeeeemale say that personality matters and take that to mean its the only thing that matters they assume shes saying looks dont matter at all im guessing because that dissonance lets them libe in their delusion women are evil creatures but who the fuck knows whats actually going on in their angry little minds
PurplePillDebate,removed,the internet can be pretty rough for sensitive people might want to wear a helmet
PurplePillDebate,removed,idk when im in a yoga class i usually would have sex with most of the class if i could and they range up to like in age lots of them dont have perfect facial features by any means but good god the young bodies and the sweat hnnnngggggg
PurplePillDebate,removed,you got brigaded by tbp people theres been a resurgence of them on here lately theyre pretty easy to spot and led by this crazt tom character the downvote button has been removed from all ppd threads but is pretty easy to access thats how they do it how do i know its them because they use the same tired and exposed sjw horseshit everytime calling you or a group you have associated with toxic is a dead giveaway speak out against their narrative youre toxic i called the epa to come and decontaminate you btw youre welcome
PurplePillDebate,removed,downvoting is against the rules of this sub so is calling you a stupid piece of shit so i wont do that it would also break the be civil rule to tell you to go fuck yourself so i wont even though almost every one of your comments broke that rule i am better than that i wont call you a raging cunt either
PurplePillDebate,removed,the reason feminists dont focus on the worst cases us that they are extremely rare the reason no one is concerned about in is because everyone knows it is a goebbelslevel big lie if it were true women would avoid college in droves feminists have turned the word rape into a joke they have lines like all rape is rape which justs waters down the experience of victims of the most brutal rapes and compares it to the rape by regret feminists use rape to scare women into being feminists it is also a major fundraiser where womens groups get tax dollars to help the city handle victims therefore it is in their interest to keep the number of rape up the reason blm is more successful is that they arent expanding the definition of murder to include putting the cuffs on too tight blm has an interest in eradicating police brutality whereas sadly feminism has an interest in perpetuating rape culture expanding the definition of rape to use it as a scare tactic to keep making money
PurplePillDebate,removed,i can see why trump appeals to you he also talks big and is full of shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one in this thread is saying that really um wut no one called men pigs still drunk
PurplePillDebate,removed,its you terps who are angry at women and angry at men you throw around the word beta for guys youre describing theres post after post after post talking about being beta its you terpaderps who are angry at obsessed personally i dont have a need to stoop to that nonsense i actually like women and women like me its remarkable how easy it is to accomplish when youre not an angry little shit but i guess the circlejek known as trp would exist without angry little shits to alpha all over each others faces all day
PurplePillDebate,removed,im just going to assume he got some sand in his butthole and its making him irritable and extra sensitive
PurplePillDebate,removed,actually i dont hate fat women they can be better than nonfat women more down to earth only i dont feel sexually attracted to them i dont understand why i should feel ashamed or embarrassed at this fact your very emotional reaction just shows how much you hate it and how insecure you are about it i wouldnt fuck the fat you but perhaps we could be friends
PurplePillDebate,removed,rekt not rekt
PurplePillDebate,removed,response a i fit description and never cheated response b no no i havent response c i have a high n and never cheated on anyone and am monogamous response d i am a promiscuous slut and i have never cheated response e no ive never cheated response f never cheated response g number i made out with a lot of boys in college so some rpers would consider me unchaste ive never cheated response h ive had casual sex friends with benefits and threesomes ive never cheated httpsdnatestingcompaternityfraud httpwwwstatisticbraincominfidelitystatistics
PurplePillDebate,removed,an argument abandoned is an argument lost
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know a woman who was promiscuous and cheated two times that i know of one was a dead bedroom and in the other they were on a break now shes married to a man that shell likely never cheat on which brings me to my next point we dont screen promiscuous girls out because we think theyll cheat on us we do it because now this guy is married to a woman whos going to make him miserable all because she probably never cheated on him and the past is the past
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have never seen reliable data supporting the in talking point the only true rape culture on this earth is probably muslims
PurplePillDebate,removed,why do you pretend to be a man youre quite clearly a woman with a really nasty ugly miss colored smelly cunt poor honey trying to overcompensate with a user name
PurplePillDebate,removed,blm has made so much progress simply because news outlets have been pushing the topic so hard and giving stupid clowns attention theyve been giving race baitors so much spotlight to keep people divided on an issue that normally almost everyone would agree on that cops need to be held accountable when they actually fuck up so instead we get coverage of at best iffy incidences of police force and attention whores crying about racism so that more reasonable people are alienated from their cause yet rape or the college campus rape in women experience sexual assaultrape etc hasnt experienced the same level of importance because its not even close to being important and the one in five claim is such obvious bullshit that even most normal people who know nothing about it can smell it rape and violent crime has been declining since like the there is absolutely no good reason for it to be a major issue
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey id give you reasonable discussion here but youve just outed yourself as unchangeably biased
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,as opposed to tbp the parody subreddit dedicated to hatred and mockery
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive seen you post with coherency before so im going to assume youre inebriated no offense im about to be the same way then maybe we can level
PurplePillDebate,removed,hmm yee girl do have small but all girl have small brain and no invent anything and we think they are all great i could see a world where men because alpha enough to get the girl theyre meant to have but again some and i think most men are too brainwashed and cuckd to ever be alpha i hate to be political but the same men in germany who vote to bring in more refugees could never be alphas
PurplePillDebate,removed,bps are fucking creeps i would never imagine making a fucking subreddit just to mock some retards on the internet same goes for srs it takes a special kind of person to go and search thoroughly for comments of random people to bitch about
PurplePillDebate,removed,im jerking off thanks for the picture

PurplePillDebate,removed,dont look for any logic when it comes to feminism to them only feels matter
PurplePillDebate,removed,you really are a troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,most young women in us are hispanic and probably have iqs
PurplePillDebate,removed,women in ppd the blue pill variety are a conservative group youll find most women to be of medium to low smv and thus they have little access to alpha males so they make do with betas there are a couple of high smv girls with dozens upon dozens of partners who agree with the red pillers but the vast majority of the women in the western world are naturally red pillers
PurplePillDebate,removed,the more you post the clearer it becomes as to why youre an incel
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is the kind of affirmation i live for thanks desu
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you read them with more intelligence and putting the whole thread in context or maybe borrie a brain or too if its too much for you sorry for being rude but you have to stop expecting me to write like i writing to a year old
PurplePillDebate,removed,you need to calm the fuck down if you want me to break it down for you i will do so by virtue of the process of omission within an open thread where you could reply to virtually any elements of a discussion regarding both halves of the population you chose to reply to a post that pertained to the half which you pertained to by claiming jokingly that you the bodies of men who women are attracted towards are physically unnatural therefore that poses a question do you believe that the male ideal of the female body is natural if you felt that mentioning it was irrelevant to the conversation
PurplePillDebate,removed,women on any sub are not representative of women as a whole
PurplePillDebate,removed,i always imagine you being one one of those trannies that look like howard stern in a dress thats creepy
PurplePillDebate,removed,theyre attracted to trannies
PurplePillDebate,removed,thanks but i dont need anything from pozzed ass
PurplePillDebate,removed,those types of women wont fuck you even if you paid them reported for personal attacks
PurplePillDebate,removed,saying women should be forced to fuck you and putting dan in jail because your a jealous fuck is a poor debate tactic fyi
PurplePillDebate,removed,what a bunch faggots
PurplePillDebate,removed,i guess youre as hideous on the inside as you are on the outside then sorry
PurplePillDebate,removed,ive got a circlejerk of butthurt terpers wow im flattered

PurplePillDebate,removed,hi op we do require sufficient text in the body of a post for users to participate without clicking elsewhere if youd like to copy your post over and provide discussion points id be happy to reapprove
PurplePillDebate,removed,an older woman is a milf to most straight guys even if shes overweight lol the incel logic is strong just because some incel is a thirsty loser that would fuck a ham sandwich if it had tits dosent mean that most men are the same
PurplePillDebate,removed,yo dont talk to that bitch skratt shes ugly af
PurplePillDebate,removed,i will always have a mancrush on brad pitt no matter how old the guy gets hell i think some old guys are attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,did you mean cuck date
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats nice honey
PurplePillDebate,removed,john oliver that way every time we would argue about trump i could bring up that i ass pounded him to shut him up add to this list john stewarts replacement
PurplePillDebate,removed,idk i didnt read that mess yet
PurplePillDebate,removed,its kinda weird i first started posting on the internet on a biblical marriage thing to plan my future marriage then rollo and his goons hijacked the place so i started arguing w them on his forum then i found about reddit so i started arguing on trp here then they banned me so i came on ppd xd but lately ive been bored by this place cause its basically the same arguments on repeat over and over again same as tbp or trp really but it did used to relieve insomnia back in the day
PurplePillDebate,removed,getting to know the woman and see if she embodies those things or not its a waste of time for most men to get to know every tattooed coal burning slut to see if maybe she has a heart of gold youre better off trying to find a good girl where good girls are more likely to be like in church or something
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre probably a coal burner and youd make that clear pretty soon
PurplePillDebate,removed,woman who fucks black men
PurplePillDebate,removed,wtf are you serious no one knew she was black she lives in richmond vancouver canada how does one assume black from that maybe if she was from baltimore or something
PurplePillDebate,removed,demographically speaking its unlikely why are you another mud shark
PurplePillDebate,removed,it would mean youre contributing to the decline of western civ
PurplePillDebate,removed,source
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh my god hes nose raping them
PurplePillDebate,removed,there are tv shows and films that glamourize or view sympathetically serial killers or mobsters like dexter the sopranos boardwalk empire etc but nobody says theres a murder culture or a mobster culture conversely rape is universally considered a serious crime and rapists are never idealized or portrayed in a sympathetic light thats one of the many reasons why the concept of rape culture doesnt stand the test of public scrutiny
PurplePillDebate,removed,says the sniveling white faggot on reddit whos opinion matters why i always find this amusing about white men you act like the world revolves around you it doesnt and black women are ugly yet you couldnt keep your tiny pink dicks out of them back in slavery the only reason we have any trace of white blood in our veins is because your ancestors kept raping ours i guess they werent so ugly then huh
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is a rape culture it is totally ok if not encouraged for women to rape men of their wealth time and even life it is celebrated by feminists and broadcast over every media outlet you get yours girl take him for everything he has etc etc men raping women on the other hand is punished hell saying hello could get you charged with hate crime in a county of the uk so is there a rape culture yes is it men raping women no
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is no rape culture just some degenerate third wave feminists pedalling their poisonous language mansplaining rape culture manspreading all the same thing just idiotic made up words to make fat ugly blue haired pigs feel important
PurplePillDebate,removed,duh instead we have a hook up culture
PurplePillDebate,removed,what does any of that have to do with rape you are just calling everything rape which quite frankly is a slap in the face to rape victims you are stuck in your own rape culture in your head
PurplePillDebate,removed,so your view is basically that all straight sex is based on rape you should go hang out on tumblr with the other andrea dworkin disciples
PurplePillDebate,removed,no point trying to reason with this mentality its too detached from reality its like debating with a member of the flat earth society
PurplePillDebate,removed,well sure when you make the definition of rape so broad that even completely consensual regret sex can be defined as rape or she was drunk and couldnt consent but he was drunk too but is responsible for his actions then yes we have a rape culture problem but hint it isnt the men creating the culture
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are delusional come back and tell me how wrong i am when you use words to make positive change in the world
PurplePillDebate,removed,rape culture is a little snappier than doesnt protect my feelings at all times culture
PurplePillDebate,removed,its more about the oversexualization of women nothing to do with rape women largely oversexualize themselves because its their own free will and they have the sexual freedom to do so again nothing to do with rape you know rape culture is real when so many men talk about sex in terms of tricking the woman into doing something to her are men accepted for raping women look at brock turner this has nothing to do with rape most sex has the male playing a dominant role when so many men feel disgusted when they think about a woman having sex with someone other than them absolutely nothing to do with rape or sexual assault rape culture is when in most places online when a picture of a woman is posted most men respond with dat ass those tits holy shit shes so hot i wanna fuck her so bad what a slut etc etc what does this have to do with rape rape culture is when men are afraid to have female children and dread their approaching the age of sexual activity where is the part about rape their hearts are breaking when they think their girs are going to get fucked getting fucked is a natural part of sex what planet do you come from rape culture is when women cant find a job after in hollywood no comment
PurplePillDebate,removed,seems like youre lumping male sexuality with rape culture
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am the society
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is just not how feminists use it for men in prison and boys preyed upon by older women there absolutely is a culture that says they deserve it or are lucky respectively this makes such occurrences more common but for western women no
PurplePillDebate,removed,there is a rape culture its being caused by of mindless drunk naked women going home alone with strange men and thinking they arent going to get fucked
PurplePillDebate,removed,of course u do arpalt
PurplePillDebate,removed,one of the top all time posts on this sub was similar to this my view was that theres more of a falsely cry rape culture than rape culture
PurplePillDebate,removed,ya well i figured id contribute to the shittiness by making a post myself now either say something or shut the fuck up and stop bitching
PurplePillDebate,removed,k you can stfu now
PurplePillDebate,removed,imagine all those poor confused beta boys girls like you are gonna raise praise unto kek that trp is there to help those poor poor boys
PurplePillDebate,removed,no no no if women dont date down its because they are stuck up or spoiled by riding the cc with a bunch of chads if men dont date down its because they shouldnt have to its females fault they are all ugly and fat s
PurplePillDebate,removed,well thats good to hear when are you gonna get some buns baking in that oven oh my god you have no idea how awesome and amazing kids are until you have them they are the best thing ever
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh no this sounds bad hopefully hes a hard worker god damn i hate the debt racket we have its too bad the horribly corrupt sell our country to the highest bidder establishment decided to straight up murder bernie sanders and they cant figure out why theyve lost everywhere in the country record losses those dumb fucks cant figure out why register dems got on the trump train
PurplePillDebate,removed,i absolutely agree with this the fun part once you are in a relationship is passing the key back and forth to each other or more liketaking the key from the other person for a little while the gatekeeper dance
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is one of those feel good trp messages for the sad saps women are the gatekeepers of sex and relationships at most levels men only start becoming the gatekeepers of commitment at the higher smv levels
PurplePillDebate,removed,do not reupload this video in music views since aug ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,they say its unfair that average men have to get into relationships and give commitment for sex rather than being chad and having heaps of casual sex with models go to rthebluepill if you just want to circlejerk
PurplePillDebate,removed,pbi one thing it would be good for you and everyone else to realize is that women love guys who cheat on them and abuse them they dont leave those guys they adore those guys women leave guys because they are boring betas who spend their time going to work and making money to support a family instead of chasing women for harems women especially despise nice guys who wont smack them in the face when they are out of line youve got all your ideas about women backwards here
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you only fuck white girls in their vags youre risk of catching anything is incredibly low
PurplePillDebate,removed,i cant believe that this is what you spend your time thinking about and doing so for grad school lol no wonder women have invented nothing ever
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok whatever you say keep women high up on that pedastal they do no wrong women would never ever stay with and deeply love a guy who smacks her around or who capriciously cheats in fact every guy who was divorced ever beat his wife if only guys would stop beating their wives we all know women wouldnt blow up their families and cause incredible harm to their own children just because they are bored or because their vag is getting tingly around someone else not women no women are wonderful they would never do such a thing in the incredible numbers they have been and are doing why just make up something bad about men to blame it on hey pbi how is your white knight strategy working with the babes you replaced the last one yet
PurplePillDebate,removed,women arent doing the safe sex thing in my experience wrap it up dudes
PurplePillDebate,removed,i can use smaller words if you think im being pedantic stop bragging about being a virgin if no one will fuck you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i can only speak for men here and truly only speak for myself but youre right i never chased women in the classic sense if we were going out together i was expecting sex within dates otherwise we would just be friends and that was fine i dont know if empowerment is the right word i just always felt that i wanted upfront communication about sexual attraction if she felt the same way about me that i did about her great lets have fun if not lets just be friends no harm no foul if a real relationship started after we had hooked up a few times cool but i was not going to chase again i dont know if that was empowering or whatever but youre not wrong
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am starting to think ulewiscross legitimately hates women lots of women have no trouble bondingprovided the man is someone actually worth bonding to idk why that is so hard for men to understand
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont know dude that chick is more of a troll than anyone else every other girl is saying that they hate being pumped and dumped and that they arent interested in casual sex and this one claims women love casual sex and dont care that chads want to just have casual sex with them
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not responsible for any bias the reader takes from my message
PurplePillDebate,removed,read the op before responding couldnt be bothered didnt expect to find anything enlightening in that wall of text just skim read it i was right
PurplePillDebate,removed,its cute that you think theres no occams razor for lesbian relationships having the highest breakup rates and gay relationships having the lowest and women ending most heterosexual relationships and men having higher depression and suicide stats after breakups despite women having overall higher depression rates the occams razor is clearly that womens attraction is weaker and less stable than men not that men are somehow unsuitable you cant come up with all different magical exceptions for all of those cases when occams razor can do it in one
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow no wonder why you cant get laid lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol rekt
PurplePillDebate,removed,not reading before responding is lazy a comment that doesnt address the op is shitposting im not insulting him im accurately describing his behavior if you dont want commenters to call out behavior like this it needs to be more strongly discouraged by the mod team
PurplePillDebate,removed,your insecurity is showing brah
PurplePillDebate,removed,ohhhhhh i see red pill truths are not absolutely true because nothing we have is they are true enough to help us do what we need to and what they need to do is be abuse manchildren i get it now
PurplePillDebate,removed,ugnometard insisted that trp doesnt have any harmful ideas about women i posted a link to a rant that literally starts with women are shit dont try to rationalize your beliefs to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill give you an indepth review of this scrubs bitter rant when i get the time
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow youre so pathetic with your personal attacks you dont even understand what im saying and yet feel you have a right to correct me please tell me do you really think your modernday genderambiguous sexpositive plussize feminist is a different species in other words you may think you are a monkey all you want youre still a human being
PurplePillDebate,removed,i edited the post at the bottom maybe its less personalized now
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are clinically retarded most quality women make their own salaries
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow aggressive arent you a sensitive little petal white men are not evil for preferring asian women but they are wankers if they believe all asian women are sex toys and obedient sex without consent is rape a yes shouldnt be needed if there is obvious consent would you be happy with world leaders who were women doubtful that is the kind of shit women have had to put up with in the past all or almost men in power yes to men and women in power police often dont investigate rape properly rape kits go untested but not always sometimes men have the finger pointed at them too easily police are not a single unit they are individuals what kind of evidence there is not always any tangible evidence when a rape has occurred women dont convict men of rape courts do cant answer your question its based on nothing
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol good one
PurplePillDebate,removed,so male moose have to spend all season growing alters toughening up and then fight it out while female moose have to do nothing thats biology buttercup it would be just as silly for a male moose to complain about the burden of performance as it is for a male human to do so
PurplePillDebate,removed,so go mgtow and quit whining that you have nothing in common with women or suck it up buttercup and make yourself as attractive as humanly possible for you not david beckham in order to find your personal unicorn third option ongoing pity party until you shoot up a womens gym
PurplePillDebate,removed,another unnecessarily long and dramatic rant great how boring your life must be if that qualifies as dramatic trying to squirm out of this by being vague wont work squirming thats what im doing i guess compliance with your unwarranted demands qualifies as squirming to you you have a truly unique understanding of the english language i wont take anything less than you asking their reaction to this its not a fair representation of the spirit of the disagreement we have had to give someone a snapshot to demand that a verbatim quote is what is necessary to settle this disagreement simultaneously labels my original banned post to misrepresent the spirit of our disagreement you would never be able to successfully make that case such a demand also suggests that you fear the responses to a question how i framed it arguably almost certainly the way i phrased the disagreement will get to the spirit of feminist thoughts because the context of our argument is inherently adversarial and my words would not be given any credibility simply due to my social associations but you knew that you wily fox rest easy the nazi faction of that community will investigate my post history and uncover this dialogue and quickly derail the discussion i only hope to gain the natural reactions you seem to think do not exist before the militant types get to snooping
PurplePillDebate,removed,so because youve never watched a single nature documentary im incorrect or maybe youre just waiting for someone to echo what you already believe youre so right females are shallow nasty and deserve nothing biology doesnt exist you should be able to wallow in your own mediocrity and have women delivered on a platter
PurplePillDebate,removed,michelangelos david is probably smaller than most romanticized images of men ive seen from this era seems like someone has no education in art history mens penises in art going all the way back to prehellenistic eras are usually shown to be very small as a huge penis was interpreted as a sign of barbarism and not being civilized
PurplePillDebate,removed,stewing in his own unhappiness is not a logical option because it seems to be what hes doing yes but unhappy does not automatically equate mass murderer the fact that you believe so is utterly ridiculous even moreso is the fact that you believe accusing someone of being a potential mass murderer is somehow honest debate its sickening then maybe he shouldnt basically be parroting the manifesto of multiple mass murderers
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not trp so your attempt to dismiss and shame me based on that alone is pathetic
PurplePillDebate,removed,well if youre an outlier why are you trying to speak for all women everywhere
PurplePillDebate,removed,uh oh the tone police are here you really are a feminist
PurplePillDebate,removed,there are two and only two variables that men need to pay attention to when it comes to attracting women attractiveness social skills attractiveness has to do with facial features uncontrollable and physique controllable get as fit as possible dress with style good haircut we all know this social skills are learning to read people once you learn how to interpret body language you can determine what is the appropriate approach for the situation humor selfdeprivation peacocking or shutting up and listening all these things can be learned dont worry about money unless you want to associate with prostitutes and gold diggers just have a grown up career of some kind if you are attractive and good with people you can potentially have sex with lots of people if you are unattractive and have bad social skills you are going to be forever alone or paying for sex thats it
PurplePillDebate,removed,another day another rper talking out of their ass one of the rules on this sub is be civil you wouldnt say that to your boss or in polite company are the mods held to the same rules as everyone else here
PurplePillDebate,removed,agreed
PurplePillDebate,removed,good lord thanks for blowing up my notifications with your reposts
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow the misrepresentation of the statement is strong in this thread must have touched on some folks special snowflakeism not that im surprised coming from you
PurplePillDebate,removed,what kind of fags need support networks youre not women you know go to weight watchers like women have for years
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,so which is fatlas fit or not fat because im not fat but i certainly do not look fit either what with my ginormous love handles and all and i literally cannot get any kind of woman at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,not particularly especially considering every time you start responding to me you fall back onto personal attacks and constant strawman arguments ultimately ending up with your comments removed forgive me but i just dont have the energy to deal with your style of socalled debate today
PurplePillDebate,removed,hold on a minute so let me get this straight she marrys a man in the act of marriage she agrees to be with this man through sickness and health then when he gets sick she goes off and finds a boyfriend she uses the money which her sick husband is getting in order to help him find joy in his life to pay off the mortgage on her house and i say her house because i seriously doubt she asked her husband permission or even thought about what her husband would think before allowing her boyfriend to move in therefore meaning that she no longer recognizes that her husband has a voice in what happens to the house and you think that this is okay that this is what he wants are you fucking kidding me you are fucked good god women can be such selfish unsympathetic and unemphatic creatures i mean men can be violent monsters but this this is just as bad if not worse whyhowwhat the fuck this is such a terrible story for the man and you and your friend are bitches men took pride in supporting a family that loves them they didnt take pride in supporting a bitch who finds another dick to fuck as soon as her husband hits a bad time in his life oh and look at that you and her are already talking about dumping him at the nearest and probably cheapestshittiest institution but not until her house is paid off fuck you if i was in his shoes i would have preferred my wife kill me before she felt like she had the right to cut my dick off and bleed me dry if he understand what his wife did to him and if he was capable he would probably kill himself
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre right about everything and i hope everyone reads this post but sipssparklingwater is just a low effort troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,we all know only become sahds
PurplePillDebate,removed,ill cyv to this shitpost the fact that men do in fact convene to discuss mens issues the fact that they do form groups online and offline shows that they do in fact take action and that its not all talk it completely debunks your accusation that they dont take action them even bothering to get together to form mra groups is them taking action nice try with this shitpost troll harder
PurplePillDebate,removed,suicide rates lol the physically grotesque poor boring men of the mra who go on to kill themselves will be missed by very few people its natural selection they should quit complaining and let nature take its course
PurplePillDebate,removed,no you wouldnt you make a thread about people whining on the internet when you post in this sub like times a day making big straw mans and crying sorry satire when people do the same to you you have no moral authority to call anyone a whiner or coward
PurplePillDebate,removed,if i sounded like an mra then i would discourage men who have literally nothing to offer from committing suicide
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice response to that passionate wellreasoned post you pathetic cuck
PurplePillDebate,removed,whoa there please watch your language uscurvemuch
PurplePillDebate,removed,id give her a fake number to a pizza place
PurplePillDebate,removed,probably the fear of being vulnerable and alone with someone who could choke you to death if they wanted to id be very conscious about being around someone stronger than me
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol flair
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats what shes saying
PurplePillDebate,removed,why you triggered

PurplePillDebate,removed,no men vant be women and women cant be men a boy cant grow up to become a woman or vice versa the very notion is silly sex is what you actually are and gender is nothing more than what role you want to play in society a transwoman is a man playing the role of a woman basically
PurplePillDebate,removed,dread game is the concept that you instill an insecure feeling in the woman giving her the vibe that you could leave the relationship at any time this is an attempt to make her put more into the relationship as well as to get more emotion out of her if a woman is feeling a mix of positive and negative emotion from you you will create a lot of attraction for example jokingly telling the girl you hate her and will never love her but pulling her in close and hugging her or holding her hand your best puas know that that swell of emotion will do crazy things to a woman dread game comes in two forms passive and active passive is simply increasing your smv your girl automatically knows that shes replaceable and she will improve herself to match you active is simply intentionally going out of your way to instill dread any number of ways

PurplePillDebate,removed,do you live in a comic book universe
PurplePillDebate,removed,you guys think being snarky automatically makes you right its a technique employed by high schoolers once you start fucking women as a heterosexual male youll realise suprisingly they all like the same shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,here im gonna tell you a little story i lost my virginity to my first girlfriend who was more experienced that i was she was a bit on an alt type and kinda crazy eventually i got the hang of sex and we started doing it more often then one day she said to me heathcliff you need to be rougher with me in bed there followed a few weeks of me awkwardly choking her and slapping her about grabbing her not really knowing what i was doing not really wanting to hurt her i was taught that girls liked slow sensual caressing loving sex and here was my girlfriend wanting me to slap her in the face and choke her until she passed out i chalked it up to her just being kind of wild and feisty but was never totally into the rough aspect i was always too afraid i would hurt her and take it too far when we broke up she made it obvious that the sex was shit except for that one time where we were drunk and you were angry at me for that thing i did and you fucked me like you didnt care that was hot oh well maybe she was just weird and damaged i thought cue next girl friend i started fucking having learnt a few things from my exgf i was a bit better at it imagine my surprise when she insisted on being spanked and called a whore while i was doing her from behind this one i was a bit more relaxed with so i started grabbing her hair and manhandling her forcing her to suck my dick waking her up with sex choking her until she went red she loved it wow i thought too really wild and feisty girls in a row lucky me i started enjoying rough sex because i figured out just how great it could be cue next girl she was my friends girlfriend i was the douchebag horny year old who fucked her anyway this girl i had known for years shed told me of all the times shed been taken advantage of of the times she was actually raped not feminist rape actual rape of the sexual abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of family members understandably i told myself to take it slow with this girl she was different to the other two i couldnt fuck her up wrong she liked it rougher and harder that the other two she liked being used like a literal sex doll she got off to me leaving marks all over her body that shed have to cover up for her bf she refused to suck cock because thats the way she used to be abused and i respected that until one day during a particularly disgustingly rough session i grabbed her head and forced her to go down on me she attacked my dick with her mouth and came without touching herself damn another damaged girl i thought what is it with me and picking these crazy girls they cant all be like this and where casual fucks and drunken ons i didnt care about them i toned up the aggressive hair pulling caveman sex cos thats the only way i could get off i considered myself a dom from that point both girls seemed to enjoy the shit out of it one called back to go for round two we chatted for a few days after they said things like ive never been used like that before it was so hot ffs i thought maybe i just attract damaged kinky girls maybe thats the vibe i give off cue my ltr years old i was virgin completely vanilla and innocent with sex got into a relationship with her and she was totally opposite to the girls id been fucking before bordering on unicorn territory the girl next door i didnt want to lose this one we took it really slow took her virgnity very vanilla fucked like rabbits after that but still super vanilla then the rough sex started to creep in again i stopped getting off to the vanilla i thought id lose her the first few times i spanked her on the arsegrabbed her neck she loved it she started asking for me to be rougher with her fast forward years and this kinky bitch is wilder and more submissive than every other girl ive slept with she loves being absolutely dominated point is she has a head on her shoulders shes not damaged shes not weird or alt shes very cutesy and feminine her family are amazing and raised her well im not the most important thing in her life i dont completely own her yet she still loves being slapped in the face and choked red when i cum i cheated on her with a girl i met who wouldnt stop complaining about how her boyfriend wouldnt fuck her right she would send me essays of erotica on how she wanted to be dominated it was more fucked up than i could think of eventually when we finally fucked i tried my best to accommodate her needs but she still told me you werent rough enough with me and eventually ghosted bitch didnt realise how strong men could be i was at if i really toned it up to like id like to try one day shedbe left bruised with broken bones i think she actually wanted me to full on rape her after a string of or more plated who all wanted the exact kind of agressive animal caveman sex ive started to notice a trend these women arent all broken or damaged or weird or kinky a lot of them are normal sweet innocent girls some are just my classmates smarter than me who i would never have believed would be into getting fucked in the arse while i push their face into a pillow and make them pass out they cant all be weird and fucked up rough sex is inherent to every girl period ive yet to meet an exception in the girls ive fucked even if there was one that would still not disprove the trend ive seen in my own life once again i can only base my worldview on my own experiences not what some disney movie or stranger on the internet has told me all women love to be dominated in bed awalt
PurplePillDebate,removed,what is described on that post would literally take hours of reading each week why would somebody do that if it wasnt part of their job or an obsession give me the cliffs notes on the present topic what would be better is if both sides would take more responsibility to link sources so that one side can get the general idea in a relatively short amount of time you are not required to read the whole sub but if you intend to debate us you must know our theory we get a lot of strawman posts from people who just straight up dont understand what were getting at they argue against a position that doesnt exist all you need to do is read the sidebar even just one of the main books we recommend then youll have a better time understanding us and subsequently debating us its like if i went to a university debate and didnt even know much about my opponents position would anyone take me seriously i know a fair few reds who just assume and openly state all blues are intellectually deficient retards whose nose is located somewhere around their transverse colon sure we all think youre stupid and brainwashed cos you are but when we argue with you we dont treat you that way we debate you just like we debate the pillers in our subs in fact we probably treat you guys nicer than we do the guys we argue with on trp if you go through all the posts of the past few weeks on average which pill presents the better formatted most civil less snarky and most intellectually honest posts sure there are some bpers who make some pretty well written posts just like the terpers who fill their angry comments with expletives but as a trend the bloops realy do just stick to omg how can you even believe this you know nothing about how the real world works youre all so fucking stupid i cant arguments terpers dont do that especially not here at least we present points you can actually argue with
PurplePillDebate,removed,damn you got us really showed me there you guys are always so right and clever how could we even hope to compete
PurplePillDebate,removed,im laughing youve never been a male and had sex with a woman you dont know what youre talking about in the slightest do you really think were too stupid to tell the difference between moans of pleasure and moans of pain do you really think the girls were fucking are too shystupid to tell us when something is hurting themdoesnt work wowee youre really invested in your delusion arent you sorry bub but thats just not how we are
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont act like i havent adequately addressed every single one of your posts be it today or in the past you however have not so ill stop wasting my time i do not believe that you agree with of it i believe you are just a blooper using that tag to try and front an air of legitimacy when you argue against us i havent seen you once defend trp or support our views in writing if it walks like a duck
PurplePillDebate,removed,if thats the case then youre a real lost cause if thats how you intend to debate us then why bother being snarky and cynical or assuming were idiots with nothing good to say and treating us that way wont convince us of anything surely youre past the age now where you understand that wont work here imma turn it around on you i feel bad for every woman whos ever had to fuck you because you obviously have no idea what youre doing just because they communicated they enjoyed it sweetie doesnt mean they did
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know a fair few reds who just assume and openly state all blues are intellectually deficient retards whose nose is located somewhere around their transverse colon yas girl yas
PurplePillDebate,removed,maybe we just have very different ideas of what are interesting threads i was around for a while now id say probably over a year now there use to be very inflammatory threads threads without a well laid out argument but still got people going enough to post en mass im glad those are gone they didnt do much imo
PurplePillDebate,removed,ha yeah that followed by public shaming a false rape accusation restraining order then divorce raping him and encouraging his firstborn male child to go trans
PurplePillDebate,removed,lololol
PurplePillDebate,removed,archwinger said it best
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,boooom checkmate
PurplePillDebate,removed,either you are retarded or you arent reading the same comments as me
PurplePillDebate,removed,i do exist
PurplePillDebate,removed,its only harassment of it comes from beta males
PurplePillDebate,removed,what would learning about womens fight for equal rights possibly do to help me understand the new feminism of today looking to fight made up issues like manspreading feminism got what it was fighting for and has no reason to even exist anymore gtfoh with your attempt to glorify modern feminism like it actually stands for something by bringing up history every wave of feminism is different and the one operating now is completely useless btw i actually had girlfriends growing up i didnt grow up a lonely loser just jacking it to the thought of touching a girl but im assuming that was your experience which would explain why youre a feminist 😸
PurplePillDebate,removed,most women arent attracted to their partners and the award for stupidest sentence ive read on the internet today goes to
PurplePillDebate,removed,coward
PurplePillDebate,removed,rp men want needy weak women someone to cling to them like a child clings to their daddy
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is like what a old would write if youd ask him to explain how dating works
PurplePillDebate,removed,thanks for your concise explanation prof tumblrina
PurplePillDebate,removed,people will have much higher degeneracy scores
PurplePillDebate,removed,a woman has got a little baggage not too much but shes not pristine and mint condition as youd have us believe first of all i dont believe i made any sort of claim involving pristine and mint condition if anything i think thats a super fucked up way to look at human beings im not claiming women with three partners are in mint condition nor do i think women with partners are in mint condition human being are not fucking action figures and comic books do you know what i think someone with three partners has life experience sexual skill the maturity that comes from surviving a breakup the ability to know what they actually want in a partner if you are so hung up with how many individual penises have been inside a woman i honestly dont think youre mature enough to even be in a relationship why is one penis times leagues better than five penises one time each that is your insecurity speaking and has nothing to do with who she is as a person you seem to be advocating for wanting a blank slate of a human being as a partner which strikes me as grooming and therefore kinda creepy if you dont want to date women with a high previous partner count dont but to tell other people that women even with as few previous partners as is damaged even if its just a little you are contributing to a very real problem in society you feel a certain way thats clear but your need to project that on others is kinda shitty especially when youre implying that my friends marriage isnt happy or good or even functional
PurplePillDebate,removed,still a personal attack
PurplePillDebate,removed,what are they gonna do about it fair use get over yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,but girl have small brain so girl less aware of being incel so is not as bad
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are kinda making some massive straw men here as is tradition here in ppd
PurplePillDebate,removed,youve had sex with multiple people how dare you
PurplePillDebate,removed,im not talking to anyone in particular dont be power hungry control freak
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah but you really are being mad ignorant i responded to the robot and you come in here and start talking crap to me hey ya dont say that
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound like a real catch without any kind of superiority complex such a stupid insult only a woman couldve written it
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck off i dont even know anyone enough to ask them out thats weird
PurplePillDebate,removed,kind of did move forward i just felt like starting a ruckus on ppd xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,my plan was to delete it when i got ratings anyway so is fine its a shame we cant do a bigger one but i doubt anyone wants to submit their own photos
PurplePillDebate,removed,i was angry but now i see youre delusional xd k
PurplePillDebate,removed,whatever you say cuckoo
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre not making any sense being an incel doesnt alter my value system its a circumstance of my life which i take into consideration when i well live it thats it what youre thinking of is negative selftalk and yeah giving that up back when i was like was a good above all normies relationships and so on what the hell is it with both terps and bloops insisting on treating all incels and fas as primitive strawman images instead of real people god youre such an ignorant retard
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you idiots did you read the post at all he quoted unfair do you know what quotes are
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is all pedantic hamstering i cannot believe you have wasted all of this time on the metaphysical nature of a can get a life
PurplePillDebate,removed,then what the fuck is the point of this thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,how dare you its not that they didnt realize but that they were lied to
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you see the difference between saying i like men with good health and i like beautiful men one term is very general and can mean anything the other is a more focused more appropriate term that describes precisely what youre trying to convey i think youre just retarded
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you pm me the pictures and stuff mods deleted the post
PurplePillDebate,removed,you guyz be hamstering while you silly little shorties are working on your gaaaaaaaammmmmmmeee your dream girls or gf is getting primastically throttled by the adonises lolooooool
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes that must be difficult for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont understand what im doing here yeah i can tell
PurplePillDebate,removed,except they do because i only sleep with people i date
PurplePillDebate,removed,heh so that is who has been downvoting all my comments on this thread
PurplePillDebate,removed,women in ths thread i am not like other women hahahahahaha
PurplePillDebate,removed,you lot sure are obsessed with chad im starting to think its not the women that want his dick up their ass
PurplePillDebate,removed,sounds like youre a bit insecure relax if homeboy wants chads cock then let him same goes to you no one is judging boo
PurplePillDebate,removed,mate honestly you need to relax lol youre taking this gay thing reaaaal personal
PurplePillDebate,removed,nothing ive said is even remotely personal to you its been a generalisation of people that talk about chad seem to be the ones that want chad i cant help that you took that as a personal attack even though i didnt even reply to you thats your homosexual tendencies issue not mine be careful though your gay is showing but as a liberal at least you know im bit judging you
PurplePillDebate,removed,what it is is that the younger the girl the less wisdom she has so those girls are both paradoxically easier to bang and better looking also they are much more likely to still have some of that delightful feminine innocence we men so enjoy you clearly know that young girls dont know who they should be fucking based on this very post so youre already a good way towards being a patriarchal shitlord join us space boobs one of us one of us
PurplePillDebate,removed,listen you were the one that took personal offence to a clearly i love chads cock statement you made yourself look gay nor is being gay shameful accept yourself us liberals love the gays
PurplePillDebate,removed,it doesnt mean she is ready to have sex whatever happened to personal responsibilty teens back in ancient times did a lot adult stuffstarting families working etc driving a metal death machine at ok fucking older men not ok your comment suggests that teenagers are too stupid to even decide who to fuck shes still a child she probably sleeps with her teddy bear and watches cartoons or these childish tv series for teens she has a disneythemed bedding and still plays with her barbie when noone is looking what fucking world do you live in i think you got adolescent and prepubescenct mixed up my sisters are and do none of that they watch mtv rated r movies bad girls club and who knows what with the internet if you are older than and it still turns you on you really should consider getting some counseling i guess of men need counseling then some girlsback in high school looked indistinguishable from a year old do men who hit on girls like that in dire need of counseling tits ass pretty face boner no way around that if you are anything over it means she is in a completely different stage of life and you have no business hanging out with her let alone hooking up if its legal in some parts of the world why not a teenage girl is safer with a year old men than her at a party full of other teensthey can get crazy
PurplePillDebate,removed,in my view ah theres the problem
PurplePillDebate,removed,very and i mean very few men are actually not having casual sex fuckbuddies or relationships nobodys buying your shit johnny bravo take a hint from elsa and let it go
PurplePillDebate,removed,tbh i dont think ppd is a good place to ask that youre going to get a lot of reeeeee responses here maybe go to askmen and even then this is still reddit so youre gonna have a sample group of betas anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh lord here we go with the daily crazy rant i knew it was coming throws a bottle of pills at you
PurplePillDebate,removed,no youre not a woman youre an overdramatic man getting sex whenever and however you want it is a luxury not doing fine xd
PurplePillDebate,removed,i weighed in appropriately as did others in the correct place with irrelevant matter that does nothing to shed light on the issue if men are getting once a month starfish sex once a month maybe they are horrible in bed and their wives are doing the grocery lists in their head for entertainment or thinking about that puppy island all true but that tells us nothing about whether men are doing fine or what doing fine looks like thats just man bashing which ive come to expect from you
PurplePillDebate,removed,men getting all the sex they want means probably having sex everyday with different women thats harder to fullfil than a woman who wants sex everyday with her partner and even then its a stretch because most women are happy with less
PurplePillDebate,removed,you want frequent sex then be really hot or good in bed and actually work to please your partner women have no good reason to have sex with you otherwise just being honest
PurplePillDebate,removed,and the ones that do are conveniently ignored by future space idiot if youve ever met a career woman who advanced in the ranks youd know they wouldnt sit here and whine and would agree with trpers for hte most part
PurplePillDebate,removed,very good is not fucking nonstop which is what you and most of the women have been shrieking about jesus christ
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont be obtuse and follow the rules simple as that i have never broken a rule here
PurplePillDebate,removed,not a mod then quit nagging me like cranky old woman i dont really care what you have to say
PurplePillDebate,removed,upvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,until i see a sextape of you banging the skinny scientist im going to assume the macho guy is the one railing you instead
PurplePillDebate,removed,your stepdad sounds like a massive cunt
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not a split vast majority of women prefer dominant partners and cant handle pressure being put on them its not different but equal men have higher stress levels when it comes to relationships and sex and when it comes to breakups they have higher depression and suicide rates despite women having overall higher depression rates i used to play mobas too and support is not easier than adc you have to keep track of a lot of things like protecting adc from being ganked vision and map awareness whereas adc just has to farm until team fights and later on has to focus on good team positioning the jungler is the most difficult role regardless sex shouldnt be a game it should be about love and understanding and most women are not loving or understanding when it comes to sex the reason why sex is so bad for women is because they get turned off easily and put too much pressure on the other person thats why lesbian relationships have the lowest rates of sex and highest breakup rates men get turned on easily women get turned off easily is not an equivalent dichotomy one side is clearly at a disadvantage
PurplePillDebate,removed,thank you for the upvote friend
PurplePillDebate,removed,k sounds good you go grrrrrrl
PurplePillDebate,removed,you should have not written anything you have i figured skipping through the text youre producing with impressing speed

PurplePillDebate,removed,am i suppose to read all this

PurplePillDebate,removed,said no woman ever
PurplePillDebate,removed,if your going to be needlessly obtuse hon theres no reason in arguing this with you
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol male virgins
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah obviously ive noticed this too hence from about a month or so ago
PurplePillDebate,removed,are men babies who need sex the way a baby needs nursing youre trying to redefine genuine concern and trust as stupidity and then you wonder why so many women build up a wall of simply not giving a fuck about men who cant get laid next time think before you post
PurplePillDebate,removed,whys this post gilded this isnt insightful marginally original contains no novel ideas invented no new concepts
PurplePillDebate,removed,yep
PurplePillDebate,removed,men are less likely to cheat this is such a stupid statement
PurplePillDebate,removed,huh
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre not got then
PurplePillDebate,removed,aint nothing wrong with cashing in on the tenable thirst of the everabundant fuckboy donations allowance incentive whatever you have to call it to justify paying for this pussy it goes in an envelope on the dresser hun
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats such a stupid reply though because you can obviously infer from my comment that my opinion is that partners qualifies for barely instead of being a dumbass why not reply with something that helps the conversation move forward
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sure you are but what does your brief flirtation with selfawareness contribute to the conversation
PurplePillDebate,removed,woman doesnt count
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not an orgasm its cheating and its downright rape the woman is not attracted to the man she doesnt get wet shes not enjoying it shes thinking about her grocery list for the day if a man cant get laid he should be castrated so he can be free from having the curse of a sex drive
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you retarded its a figure of speech
PurplePillDebate,removed,or is all that simply proof positive that theyre so obsessed with women they have to make rules to not be obsessed with them this
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah sadly a guy needs to be a chad to get married to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,entitlement
PurplePillDebate,removed,i only approach young women sorry
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are one of the most obsessive of all because you have written about how bitter you are because many women treat you like trash how sad
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah i serve better certain purposes the purpose of making your ass comfortable enough for the next guy to fuck you there
PurplePillDebate,removed,i know you are but what am i quit being a bad debater if thats all you got then just keep that weak shit to yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youd be okay with me fucking your mom doubt it
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre talking about how you perceive yourself as a victim but really youre just a pussy but what you said was men and women have no need for different doctors im interested in calling you out for saying something stupid
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol i found the fatty
PurplePillDebate,removed,thank you im annoyed he was pretending im crazy for not understanding his glaring contradiction there
PurplePillDebate,removed,httpswwwredditcomrdirtymindbots timetoleavethegame brought me here
PurplePillDebate,removed,fatass calls me aspie gets what she deserves
PurplePillDebate,removed,show me the man who claims to not regularly fantasize about just straight up raping the attractive women in his life and i will show you a liar i think one of the worst things to happen to human sexuality was the advent of kink and rape play i dont want to roleplay raping a woman i want to actually rape her the more intense the violation the sweeter the feel i want to leave a woman a mentally destroyed gibbering shuddering catatonic wreck who will never have another healthy relationship relive her experience infinite times and wake up screaming and sobbing her entire sexuality destroyed either turned frigid or into a compulsive nympho seeking to wash me out of her system with other men not that she ever will mind
PurplePillDebate,removed,in fact i am very suspicious when men claim they do not fantasise about rape probably because you think men are all rapists and yes i am a rapist
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats why its good not to act like how men want to act women you turn off men like that because theyre sadistic
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh wait thought you were op she was the cunt forgive me you all look the same to me all around lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,you seriously need to get a life
PurplePillDebate,removed,in my deep manly voice is that the same manly voice you use with me honey or is it just for the ladies
PurplePillDebate,removed,how you doing
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think they realized this was a queer making typical catty outlandish comments before they marched off on their little nylon clad warpath they probably thought it was a straight dude evincing absolutely autistic levels of open undisguised sexism as if this was the fucking still they whipped themselves into a triggered frenzied fight the circlejerk before they even knew wtf was going on shows how manufactured all the feminist outrage is these days kudos to the fag for quickly identifying himself as a minority btw he wasted no time getting that pc shield up harder for shitlibs to lynch a homo they prefer their targets cishet
PurplePillDebate,removed,hundreds of thousands of men reporting the truth hundreds of thousands but hey what could hundreds of thousands of men know i guess ill just go to sleep with my hawt girlfriend who deep throated me this morning before making me sandwiches lol lol who ever knows how this happened how did this happen who could ever know wheres my official science study im just so confused
PurplePillDebate,removed,pua responses q want to go out and have some fun a i have a boyfriend q thats ok i dont want to be your boyfriend i actually want to go out and have some fun with you this response branches into other pua responses potential comebacks and critiquesanalysis so i will post this three times if the mods dont have a hemorrhage
PurplePillDebate,removed,critiquesanalysis q want to go out and have some fun a i have a boyfriend q thats ok i dont want to be your boyfriend i actually want to go out and have some fun with you this response branches into other pua responses potential comebacks and critiquesanalysis so i will post this three times if the mods dont have a hemorrhage
PurplePillDebate,removed,men are gutter trash and disposable men deserve no rights just lol at mras
PurplePillDebate,removed,please see my comments if you go away and think about it you might be able to work it out for yourself einstein
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont worry youre not the kind of woman who would need to worry about things like this happening to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,yep as expected an average mentality that will lead to a mediocre life moving on now
PurplePillDebate,removed,they deserve to be raped if they put themselves in a position to be thats not being misogynistic thats just basic common sense if i walked around in the middle of jamaica queens at midnight with a bill sticking out of my zipper i deserve to be robbed please stop with the typical feminist shaming and hamstering this is obvious
PurplePillDebate,removed,yall are rape apologists and rapists in waiting you can go fuck yourself i hope you die of old age never getting to see the totalitarian state you no doubt dream about on a nightly basis
PurplePillDebate,removed,i swear officers she just fainted i dont see any bruises or marks on her body as if she had been struck by an object so therefore i obviously could not have made her pass out proceeds to burn the chloroform rag later caught because things like chloroform can be traced in the body and proceeds to blame it all on feminism and men being oppressed
PurplePillDebate,removed,theyre not victims when they put themselves in that situation so theres no one to shame in that situation a woman walking along that gets abducted and raped is a victim you seem to be drinking the feminist koolaid by the gallon hopefully you apply personal responsibility and accountability to your own life
PurplePillDebate,removed,nope its a sign of disrespect no women is going to shit test an attractive man theyll just make it really easy and fun for you
PurplePillDebate,removed,grace hopper the first highlevel programming language plankalkül was proposed by konrad zuse in the first compiler was written by grace hopper in for the programming language the functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler the first autocode and its compiler were developed by alick glennie in for the mark computer at the university of manchester and is considered by some to be the first compiled programming language the fortran team led by john backus at ibm is generally credited as having introduced the first complete compiler in cobol was an early language to be compiled on multiple architectures in fucking feminist propaganda
PurplePillDebate,removed,however if youre really honest that youre new at learning pretty sure theyre just a troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,welcome to arguing against tbp
PurplePillDebate,removed,how the fuck can anyway argue against spreading love and resoecting your fellow human by not being a weird feelsy moralfag
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is genetic whats your point bullshit so if for example an ugly short indian dude did these things youre saying he could be attractive dont be so naive oh its you again that salty indian guy
PurplePillDebate,removed,if you sit down playing world of warcraft and eating doritos for hours a day youd have to have some pretty good genetics
PurplePillDebate,removed,there are literally children in africa starving eat shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,what the hell are you talking about
PurplePillDebate,removed,if youre a badass red piller and women are pretty much interchangeable to you getting laid isnt a problem maybe you work a pinch harder at it than ultra chad the genetic god but who doesnt join my cult and youll get laid like chad youll just need to work a little bit harder and you can even bang super hot women as a feet tall ugly kid from india
PurplePillDebate,removed,how about some kind of reasoning or argument to follow that retarded sentance up with
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont need to spend hours in the gym to learn something that anyone with a brain can see if i went to the gym i would get bigger arms and back which would not change my face in any way i dont even know what is meant by groom better but i certainly dont have unkept facial hair and i think my clothes are fine but again that has nothing to do with how my face looks
PurplePillDebate,removed,why the fuck do you sub iq retards keep making these assumptions about me and you pretty much just agreed with what i said a can maybe become a with a lot of work and a can maybe become a with some work but in the end where you stand boils down to genetics
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh my fucking god would you people stop making these assumptions about me im not some fat wow playing nerd in fact i probably put way more effort into my appearance than any of you do in fact i have a list of plastic surgeries i would like to get done saved on my computer every single day my whole life is about the way i look
PurplePillDebate,removed,rtheredpill is a sub made by below average whites ethniks who dillude themselves into thinking they can get women by having game
PurplePillDebate,removed,you cant really change much in the skull i would like to get eye fillers eyebrow transplant eyebrow botox chin implant lefort rhino chin filler buccal fat removal which would be a noticable improvement im estimate that i would go up around points from all of these probably wont end up getting all of that tho but thats still just a small part of it mostly the shape of my skull is set in stone and theres not really much that can be done about it
PurplePillDebate,removed,we arent talking about my problem here i never even said i have a problem thats not what this is about at all
PurplePillDebate,removed,most people already have maximized their potential because its not hard it pretty much just boils down to not being a fat fuck now just because youve acomplished that doesnt mean youre not ugly
PurplePillDebate,removed,wtf how low iq are you personality is not genetics lmao u r a retard
PurplePillDebate,removed,tell me how do i control the way my face looks
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think it will make your life better though i am not saying this to be rude or insulting on the internet but i genuinely think for you theres a disconnect between reality and what you see it would make me look better which would make my life better this is not even a question thats just facts if that is you honestly guy youre pretty attractive its a random post with cherry picked low quality images and for all you know thats not even me maxilla is the upper jaw you mentioned you think you need a le fort i a lefort is about getting a more forward lower jaw which would be a major improvement for me
PurplePillDebate,removed,rofl how low iq are you
PurplePillDebate,removed,literally just give me one way to improve the way my face looks without plastic surgery and i will give you gold right now
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think i just figured out that youre retarded
PurplePillDebate,removed,r u a troll
PurplePillDebate,removed,you got me mad saying i was gay and shit fuck you thought
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow that is really insightful analysis you must be very smart
PurplePillDebate,removed,of the major normative ethics virtue ethics focuses almost entirely on character while ignoring actionduty deontology and consequence consequentialism it has been my observation that bpers tend to focus a lot more on how a persons actions reflect on hisher character rather than the actions themselves or the consequences of those actions do you actually exude a slimy viscous substance from your pores as you type fiat
PurplePillDebate,removed,iunno what your deal is but you can suck my dick if really aint got nothin better to do
PurplePillDebate,removed,seriously you must be like sub iq or something like wow even by reddit standards
PurplePillDebate,removed,at the end of the fuckin zipper bitch fuck off
PurplePillDebate,removed,i feel like you might work with uquestioningwoman
PurplePillDebate,removed,did u require a citation when u lost ur virginity too
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why youre incel
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,for the record bitch i am not lazy or comfortable
PurplePillDebate,removed,and what issues made you this way i doubt you were born the man hating sociopathic woman you are now
PurplePillDebate,removed,feminism is a movement which only has womens interests at heart and has now branched off to trans people etc it seems but it still retains its prime enemy males
PurplePillDebate,removed,going after feminists modern birth control is still poison and affects about of women who take it with frightful side effects its not what i read on scientific literature but ive been told i cant judge because im a guy as usual it looks like a matter of feelz over realz with them
PurplePillDebate,removed,well im mainly just curious on how the redpill would see it from their perspective i was using my situation as the example of the general op question
PurplePillDebate,removed,its pretty funny how often they use it as a defense
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sorry mate you seem to be a bit thick lacking in reading comprehension or determined to put words into my mouth for some bizarre reason there is no point in me repeating myself for a third time
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes the current wave of feminism is a female supremacy movement its not about equality in other news water is wet
PurplePillDebate,removed,clean that post up its way to circlejerky
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre a sad person
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,you are annoying keep this up and i will block you i doubt a guy who fucks models as casual bangs would want him even to clean his toilet but whatever sunny
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean theyre out right allowed to legally murder it so if you agree thats fair game i dont see how fucking it up a little is anymore severe
PurplePillDebate,removed,dammit shouldve added in the inevitable reply by the asshole claiming his girlfriend is a complete sex fiend
PurplePillDebate,removed,it should be punishable to protect the wellfare of the baby fathers can be jailed for failure to pay child support citing the childs wellfare as the reason women should receive at minimum community service for drinkingsmoking and should receive harsher punishments for illicit drugs perhaps jailtime differed until the baby is born
PurplePillDebate,removed,well in canada if that kid then comes out a little tardy then my taxes gotta pay for that shit so no there should be some consequences for it if you knowingly binge drink and do heavy drugs while pregnant against your doctors wishes keep in mind i still operate under the belief that not everyone should be able to procreate you should have to take a test course and apply for a licence and show that you can financially and emotionally support a child
PurplePillDebate,removed,biological sex is completely irrelevant men and women are exactly the same only genitalia is different i dont like your sexist assumption that biological sex may influence anything
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre trolling if you dont want to be accused of it dont do it
PurplePillDebate,removed,httplmgtfycomqgenderisasocialconstruct
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre bp so go to rthebluepill and ask them what gender is
PurplePillDebate,removed,i remember when the surgeon general earlier this year came out to suggest women shouldnt drink if they might be pregnant feminists were outraged remember financial abortions are evil because lack of parental financial support will kill the kid but asking mom to put down the appletini for a moment so the kid isnt permanently retarded is an outrageous limitation of her personal autonomy
PurplePillDebate,removed,genius women haha
PurplePillDebate,removed,women like torture porn like twilight only you choose not to see who is actually being tortured and women dont like to see it either its just a sublimated version of what men like which is unbecoming of women the rules of the game are different as is the field of play medium but winning means the same thing and happens the same way what is the first thing we learn about bella edward bella has special blood which solicits an uncontrollable urge in him to suck her see women like violent alpha males that take what they want shut up youre not paying attention being around bellas super special blood is torturous to edward he not only has to suppress this urge it simultaneously compels him to want be around her too he wants to want actually i want a girl to want me ewwwww stop being gross eventually he gets to taste her blood which is sweet ambrosia from the gods insofar as it saves and services her its hard to stop drinking her blood if it wasnt the allegory has no meaning but he does stop the money shot is a ruined orgasm how kinky roxanne corseter is a focused journaliststrongwilled beforehertime debutante thats taking a ship ride to the board room on the way the ship gets commandeered by a pirate named love interest who you want by virtue of him wanting you love interest poses some challenge but he is not an expression of power to behold he is power to possess he is not possessed during the first sex scene on pg for all of us with netflix sex just reminds you what the story is about after all the abstractions he is possessed during pg when he is staring at her with sadhungry eyes he is possessed when he agonizes in front of some mirror in his apartment while taylor swift is playing at he doesnt agonize too hard mind you there isnt a big enough market for it given women are happy with masturbating twice a year love interest facial abuse exists probably at a lower margin but thats not whats being discussed but at the current volumedemand you just see teen slut loves choking on special blood men and women are different no shit see above women have complementary sexual demands to mine you are looking at the events not the abstractions because youre not a woman and women dont want anybody to see this even themselves
PurplePillDebate,removed,the common complaint by women that men in porn are unattractive is the single best argument against the idea that being muscular makes you attractive
PurplePillDebate,removed,keeps jacking
PurplePillDebate,removed,its not my issue if a bunch of freak tards are killing themselves people are free to kill themselves all they want how do you expect the world to take us seriously whenhow many times do i need to say itwe elected someone with no experience no training no discipline and not even fucking manners all that and still better than a woman edit still waiting to find out what you idiots are going to do when you lose all access to abortion period im engaged to be married so i would probably just expedite the wedding and have a baby
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is what i dont get like you voted for donald trump just because he makes you cum no you being this butthurt makes him cum
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh my god your salt piles are reaching the clouds
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey theres always plan c push her down the stairs
PurplePillDebate,removed,scandals lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,bbbut muh ignorance
PurplePillDebate,removed,that post is horseshit leftist boilerplate i find it hilarious that after an entire campaign of no really guys hes a racist not workingyoure still going to try it i also find it hilarious that trumped received smackon of the popular vote but somehow his supporters are a gaggle the ideology has completely crowded out both reality and logic from your brain
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am doing a survey on households and gender attitudes would love to hear from you guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,i am doing a survey on household type and gender attitudes and would love to hear your opinions
PurplePillDebate,removed,crucifying watch out guys we got ourselves a martyr over here
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont worry ill give her lots of hugs
PurplePillDebate,removed,guide to managing your bitches bluepill calls it enforcing your boundaries what i read in that article is not enforcing boundaries its treating women like theyre inferior the most responsible teenager in the house bluepill calls it be playful and assertive this is not what the article i read said it literally said that women stop maturing at age im years old im an entirely different and more complete human being than i was when i was sexual strategy is amoral bluepill says women are adults and are capable of making their own decisions they are but its pretty scummy to manipulate them into making the decision to fuck you how is that even fun i prefer knowing that the man im fucking really wants to be fucking me and not doing it because i preyed on his insecurities and conned him into fucking me thats not sexy at all when men do it successfully to women the majority think its sexy and masculine when we write it down to share with each other and they read it suddenly some blue pillers think its abusive and horrible we didnt design how women work i feel some people in your camp are more horrified that certain politically incorrect things work on women and then they proceed to try to shift blame on those nasty evil rapey redpill strawmen no what i find sexy and masculine is a man who isnt so insecure that he needs to put other people down to get what he wants the sexy men i know dont behave however you think they behave if you think red pill tactics are an effective way to artificially emulate them women are not some faceless mob of clones who all function the same way if some guy tried negging me id laugh in his pathetic face it might work on some women but they probably arent emotionally healthy to begin with my family moved times as a kid i grew up to an immigrant family stuck between completely discordant cultures my parents prevented me from socializing a lot i had no role models no one who looked like me i was singled out and bullied i still have generalized anxiety and had depression it helps me to have this stuff written down so i can catch up since im somewhat spergy but i guess that doesnt matter my own personal happiness is not important of course your personal happiness matters your potential mates happiness matters just as much though your quest for personal happiness does not give you the right to manipulate women into fucking you i grew up bullied as well i fight anxiety and depression every day i know its fucking hard i was your female counterpart for many years tricking people into giving you what you want by preying on their insecurities is not going to help you becoming a person people genuinely want to get to know is what will help you im sorry i didnt just get it like all the other boys with better childhoods my husband doesnt get it either hes awkward as fuck sometimes i think hes a little spergy thats okay because hes also kind and smart and sexy and he treats me like the kind smart and sexy person i am were equals we respect each other were honest with each other he is probably exactly what you picture when you think of a beta male except i make twice as much money as he does and i dont give a fuck because i love him and that shit doesnt matter i guess im not allowed to become attractive to women or improve myself like other men of course youre allowed to become attractive to women and improve yourself thats definitely what you should be doing youll be a better person and have better luck building a happy life for yourself if you forget the manipulative shit and just treat women like people dont hate the player hate the game thats exactly what im doing i dont hate you i hate red pill sexual strategy if all you guys suddenly stopped trying to play silly games to get women to fuck you and started behaving like mature reasonable adults who treat women like they are also mature reasonable adults i would think youre awesome the selfimprovement stuff is great lifting is great pursuing your interests and becoming a wellrounded person is great do it i support you wholeheartedly just stop being a dick
PurplePillDebate,removed,where im from sugar there are no guns and this is where men are really men youd shit your pants plus you dont own one anyway
PurplePillDebate,removed,nice edit sugar youre already scared lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,know your place peon
PurplePillDebate,removed,hey you need to add a description of the linked material in your post let me know when you have and ill reapprove thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,can you copypaste some of the descriptions of the studymethodology into your post i think that might make it easier for people to discuss thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol you forgot the word incel in the title
PurplePillDebate,removed,i would love some blue pill explanation of this one my gut feeling is it will probably be some variant of shaming the man he wasnt doing enough or the right thing
PurplePillDebate,removed,that might honestly be the dumbest thing ive heard all week perhaps you should graduate high school and get some real relationship experience before you make sweeping generalizations
PurplePillDebate,removed,he should kill her
PurplePillDebate,removed,one of the biggest bullshit memes on the internet and especially that hub of degeneracy and mental retardation that is the reddit relationships sub is that everything must be overtly communicated at all times in a relationship just tell her how you feeeeeeeeeel bro why are you communicating enough just let her know you feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel this way
PurplePillDebate,removed,every seconds another beta is divorce raped by his materialistic whore of a wife and most of them are inwardly spouting the same femaleapologetics you just did i doubt we come to any form of agreement i too have eyes to see how women act towards men who stop funneling them money if women were a race theyd be jews for sure utter parasites theyre lucky god gave them pussies or someone wouldve systematically wiped them out long ago
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol well id rather be a fucking nerd who cant get laid than a drug addict like yourself
PurplePillDebate,removed,so youre saying the men on trp want to kill and harm women thanks d
PurplePillDebate,removed,except for the part where its only a slight uptick not affecting the majority and being unemployed isnt a synonym for nurturing youre totally correct please come back to earth we miss you here robot man
PurplePillDebate,removed,the bp hamster is going nuclear in this topic lol women are only moderately attracted to betas they need them as providers and sperm donors
PurplePillDebate,removed,ok cool
PurplePillDebate,removed,im going to go ahead and say the biggest mistake was ignoring all the red flags i saw in the very beginning like weeks in and dating him anyways but step blameshift it was him i contributed step diminish responsibilities for actions that include you when he emotionally abused me step make sure hes an abusive controlling asshole i didnt set strong boundaries i am too darn nice this was my first relationship okay and ive never had any of these problems in any other relationship okay
PurplePillDebate,removed,so again you did nothing wrong why are you posting here
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats why i titled it your share to avoid you coming in here with some equality argument a lot of both people can be at fault but no one yet saying they were at fault without completely minimizing it or blame shifting this is outright rp porn so far
PurplePillDebate,removed,blameshift unbelievable this thread is blowing my mind
PurplePillDebate,removed,well without actually being there your dont know how much of it is blameshift or just dating shitty guys and i dont care either the thread exists to demonstrate that a woman can never have fault in a relationship it was one of those nastier rp truths that i had to prove to myself thread is doing an outstanding job of it
PurplePillDebate,removed,or maybe youre an idiot what do you do
PurplePillDebate,removed,saying well the victim was partially responsible isnt untrue so we agree then dont care about the rest of your essay soz
PurplePillDebate,removed,bpers are quick to resort to the exception fallacy when you point out that men and women are significantly different they claim its a generalization
PurplePillDebate,removed,yup still cant grasp the most simple of concepts i feel sad for you you must dress for other people and not yourself i hope someday you realize you can actually dress however you like however makes you feel happy for now have fun being a sour whiny prick lol try not to let other people get to you as much
PurplePillDebate,removed,aww poor you not in the good old days anymore wahhhh give me a break
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound like a high school boy who cant control himself and yeah you seem thirsty af
PurplePillDebate,removed,literal lol ppl love of discussing incels
PurplePillDebate,removed,literal lol ppl love of discussing incels
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are women the only ones that need control a man seeing a prostitute unbeknownst to his wife on a business trip doesnt uproot the entire fabric of society women wasting their most fertile years fucking chads and tyrones and working in a office at nonprofit does people marry to feel happy if marriage isnt making you happy anymore i dont see why you should stay with your partner making the life of both miserable the idea that marriage should be about love is a recent concept and a gay one at that gender roles promote selfentitlement and irresponsibility gender roles are perfectly natural and are the optimal way to keep a society healthy playing to men and womens strengths on average makes sense going against the grain of biology is dumb
PurplePillDebate,removed,you have to go back
PurplePillDebate,removed,they spread their sperm but not invest in the children single motherhood was not common in the its really not an issue in a society where infidelity single motherhood and degeneracy are discouraged how exactly is western society rotting and what does divorce have to do with it the white birth rate is declining and contrary to popular belief you cant just totally replace the genetic stock who created a society and expect that society to function as it always has if i replace the population of japan with mexicans its not going to be japan even if they attempt to adopt their culture completely no what society should promote is that individuals arrange their marriages how fits them the best no thats muh freedom muh individualism talk i dont believe in that freedom isnt this perfect value that we should autistically focus on above all else in my opinion i disagree with many enlightenment values an important question to ask is freedom for what if its freedom to be a degenerate than i disagree with that freedom i said gender roles i never mentioned anything about men and women being the same physically gender roles came about as as a result of the genetic differences between men and women
PurplePillDebate,removed,why did they change it they didnt it was largely jewish women who led the feminist movement
PurplePillDebate,removed,either they decide they want something more than a pretty face a nice set of tits and a nice arse to give them orgasms theyre stupid getting married without a prenup nowadays they think it is something they need to do they got tricked into it they believe it is a precursor to having kids they found someone whose decent aka not like some of you crazy gals on reddit tumblr etc they want something to come home to while having side pieces there are a multitude of reasons though youll find most men are antimonogamy upon meeting a certain kind of woman care to guess what kind
PurplePillDebate,removed,and you have a middle class income
PurplePillDebate,removed,because theyre only half of the problem men should only be able to have one woman in public actually birth rates are declining worldwide false africa is booming right now and unfortunately these people dont have the iq to maintain a modern society and as we give them more aid it causes a malthusian trap where their population gets bigger and then they need more aid to take care of all the new people most jobs today are office jobs and can be equally done by men and women theres jobs that shouldnt be done by women that arent physical as well
PurplePillDebate,removed,er was not denied sex er never tried er should be the poster child for a male hapa holocaust in the west making half asian sons is child abuse
PurplePillDebate,removed,move on and get with the times man for most of human history my view was the norm and this society is unsustainable what comes up must go down and eventually we will go back to something more stable maybe not in my lifetime but it will happen and minorities i dont want to oppress them i just want them out of white nations
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont know about all incels but he was a martyr for me he did what i dream about doing but i have neither the balls or the means he had to do it
PurplePillDebate,removed,went over your head too eh
PurplePillDebate,removed,go buy a prostitute then bitch since its not that big of a deal thats why your punk ass is single bitch i see why youre incel now your ass probably looks like a woman try and help who the fuck do you think youre fooling youre a piece of shit who want to kick them while theyre down you arent trying to help anyone you selfinvolved asshole
PurplePillDebate,removed,they would be just a farmers son who ends up marrying that plump but cute daughter of the neighbor farm or they would be doing something else that would be equally mundane i think for lots of people specifically men specifically incels they would be perfectly content with a hoe and a ho over modern day loneliness
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is why trps are like feminists they wanna have their cake and eat it too a lot of them wanna spin plates and have it be the where am i sure they are all don draper
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah because life is awful its a constant fight for survival to spread our genes to not be shot to not be raped to not die of cancer and then if we survive any of that we have to deal with growing old becoming feeble incontinent impotent weak bald alzheimers parkinsons uck dude its just getting eachother off not some magical pinnacle of human existence hell sometimes you cant even be bothered and would rather just bat one out on your own why should everyone die just because you are worried someone doesnt want to have sex with you just chill its not the end of the world what dude its not about fucking or not fucking its just that life is an anormaly we should be alive theres no planet in the universe with life this is it until we are finally destroyed misery and pain and suffering with continue to exist
PurplePillDebate,removed,football players theres no greater celebration of masculinity than in sport masculinity is not necessarily selfishness or violence but it is about winning and achieving which is why women find status so attractive not only good genes but good protection the fact that we tell boys to be more feminine in their approach while paying boxers millions to beat the hell out of each other is mind boggling there are also movie stars martial artists and adventurers who we admire because of their achievements men want to be action heroes and many of those who are get greatly rewarded masculinity i think is channeled aggression towards a goal and achieving it think firefighters or others involved in rescue services and your sportsmen theyre celebrated and people love them but when boys show a semblance of masculinity people are afraid because it might be toxic and hell start snapping necks what we need is a healthier way to handle boys masculinity as well as a healthier way for them to express it sport is one such avenue competition at least the desire to compete is a masculine trait that we seem to be discouraging yet ironically we reward those who do compete and win i suspect too many parents are afraid their children might get hurt but pain is not evil it exists for a reason and we can learn from it when its done the right way
PurplePillDebate,removed,yes are you having trouble following along
PurplePillDebate,removed,i swear if i see this message one more time xd show you what uncivil looks like
PurplePillDebate,removed,it is the term itself which is wrong and what i am talking about all the time just because you either lack the capability or the will to understand does not actually make it shouting does it also how do you shout at people over the internet without using an audio file
PurplePillDebate,removed,the hatred against incel men is so unreal those guys clearly have mental issues and personality problems what they need is help and compassion not hatred and to be driven further underground how would you feel if we started telling all women with depression to cut themselves
PurplePillDebate,removed,dont ask them to provide actual data that hurts their feelings
PurplePillDebate,removed,both of you are one is quiet and sinister and the other is straight up bullies
PurplePillDebate,removed,fuck do these lil dudebros look like walking around with a wedding ring on xd how ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,removed,they already pretend to be high value chads so why not just go further and get the wedding ring
PurplePillDebate,removed,also ive noticed your username cropping up a lot on this forum and im relatively certain youre in high school
PurplePillDebate,removed,the absence of writing about a specifically worded problem doesnt mean they endorse the problem or hate men all indirect evidence suggests otherwise which places the burden of proof on you seriously dude at this point youre either trolling or functionally retarded the absence of them saying anything about it doesnt prove what their stance it but it does prove they havent said anything about it which was my initial claim you retard do you have the reading comprehension and intellectual honesty to acknowledge this notice how youve still refused to quote back my initial claim do so in your next response and address what i actually said or ill take that a an admission that youre just trolling
PurplePillDebate,removed,what kind of man makes such an obvious lie to trick a girl into sex one that spends his day at the gym and negging
PurplePillDebate,removed,lastly this pretty much ends the possibility of more than a ons perfect for trp maybe for a mildly sociopathic man but i repeat myself
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre completely unhinged can you remove this from your comment thanks
PurplePillDebate,removed,awalt is a set of tendencies he knows this hes just a troll your time is better spent almost anywhere else
PurplePillDebate,removed,however something the red pill does advocate is treating women appropriately not only youre delusional youre also a liar you are the moderator of the lovely rfemalehate all the positive things you described like working out and being social are common sense thats like saying the core of the nazi ideology is equality this is real life right so why is that out of the most upvoted threads of all time are about actively hating women and sjws the red pill absolutely advocates hating women while at the same time revolving your life around them you just said if a man decides to make himself happy the horror hes a loser because he doesnt get laid you are validated by women in everything you do you are the ones that need to swallow the pill and wake up from your trumpmilodaddy induced coma
PurplePillDebate,removed,boo hoo people talk to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,i mean if you whine when people are attracted to you you are a loser
PurplePillDebate,removed,wow i can tell you arent as smart as you think you are
PurplePillDebate,removed,tldr trp is wrong women are smart society thought it was a good idea to ensure smart people stayed home so the home life could be improved for future generations behold the thought process of the modern woman god help us all
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont think you understand what he is trying to say he said penis penis wont anyone think about the penis the penis alone is extremely important
PurplePillDebate,removed,actually that is pretty much exactly what trp and all pill based subs are about its okay if you dont understand that but have an open mind and avoid the immoral impulse to censor
PurplePillDebate,removed,i think for guy b if it was he doesnt want an open relationship but if hes out with friends or has an easy lay with a hot chick he wants to be able to go for it so long as its not in everyones face then most women would be okay with it
PurplePillDebate,removed,wait did i just stumble into the wow forums here on ppd this reads like you are minmaxing a mage for raiding a bit of casual pvp relationships are not done using excel
PurplePillDebate,removed,its p clear that your aspergers is clouding your ability to understand context
PurplePillDebate,removed,cuck him
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,casual sex with chad automatic slut
PurplePillDebate,removed,i agree if i had no idea about a certain cult but then people started saying hey is a total scientologist because he does xy and z i would be a little offended since i would never want to associate myself with them same goes for anything that i am not actually involved in
PurplePillDebate,removed,i presume he believes in the patriarchy and that men oppress the women therefore nothing women do can hurt men
PurplePillDebate,removed,i dont care what some cuck is blabbering about i dont like seeing trigglypuffs on screen say what you want i give no fucks shame doesnt work on me
PurplePillDebate,removed,more like brown stinky and disgusting ie shit
PurplePillDebate,removed,shhhhh she doesnt allow logic in her body her body her choice
PurplePillDebate,removed,the only places overpopulated are the hell holes we accept immigrants from
PurplePillDebate,removed,overpopulated by inferior people culturally at least
PurplePillDebate,removed,id love to hear you explain how the scary brown people are going to destroy the western world please go ahead
PurplePillDebate,removed,i like cats too
PurplePillDebate,removed,all im saying is dont oversell your goods ladies
PurplePillDebate,removed,so you didnt read it tbp in a nutshell
PurplePillDebate,removed,so a guy makes a provocative thread title people read it and see that there is a good and uncontroversial point made inside and upvote it then tbp rushes in and takes the provocative thread title literally and argues that it is highly upvoted so it most reflect trp core values now of course we could all decide that since we have an audience of bloopers that are either dishonest or retarded we should always communicate in ways they cant possibly misunderstand no more cocky thread titles no more special lingo no sarcasm or irony or we could not care and you bloopers can either stay out learn to read or keep on with your bullshit and then get called out for it repeatedly so far youve picked the latter which is why most red pillers have a hard time taking tbp seriously
PurplePillDebate,removed,i could power a bus with the cringe
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is getting sad
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh look another post by rollo where he posts a wordy essay and expects people to read and digest it but he wont show up to engage in any dialogue on the matter just link people to his blog seriously why is this shit permitted
PurplePillDebate,removed,oooh rollo why are you posting on ppd so much
PurplePillDebate,removed,i have mentioned this before but i have seen thread here talking about how the differences between gay men and lesbians verify sexual the differences between men and women however i know i have met lesbians in real life who act like fuckboys and who do the same kind of game on other women that terpers talk about of course they can always just put this back into their own ideology look even lesbians use red pill tactics its unfalsifiable crap
PurplePillDebate,removed,alright tell us where did daddy touch you
PurplePillDebate,removed,because because your dumb
PurplePillDebate,removed,false i find her gorgeous but her attraction to black dudes makes her disgusting
PurplePillDebate,removed,hahaha
PurplePillDebate,removed,here have your upvote
PurplePillDebate,removed,who the fuck cares what british faggots think
PurplePillDebate,removed,oh the theory is all men want to have wild sex with a harem thats cute keep frame whatever its not like anyones going to change your mind but next time can you make your social theories without drafting the rest of us to star in your masturbatory fantasies
PurplePillDebate,removed,this is retarded every man wants more
PurplePillDebate,removed,if i have to actually explain because youre having trouble low t gaming addicts could be alphas based on your criterion if they only desire low quality starfish sex once a month his needs are fully men he is a self actualised alpha
PurplePillDebate,removed,it only really applies to white and asian women apparently because black chics slay and command attention well into their and
PurplePillDebate,removed,people with low t if you read
PurplePillDebate,removed,what facts other then welfare checks wtf are black women getting hell everyone knows black women get ditched to be single moms more then any other race
PurplePillDebate,removed,thats your source reality tv shows gtfo
PurplePillDebate,removed,according to who im in nyc and i see good looking year old women turning the heads of alphas years old every time i go out to clubs maybe you live in the south or some place where people get fat but in cities like nyc la and san francisco where women make their own money age is literally just a number
PurplePillDebate,removed,you arent and have never been an actual alpha male real alphas dont know what trp is so you dont know what its like real alphas can and will fuck the year old and the year old cougar in the same night sometimes at the same time in a threesome he loses nothing by fucking both of them i see young alpha males pursuing good looking older women literally every day
PurplePillDebate,removed,you sound afraid i feel the tides are beginning to turn women are starting to wake up and realize that we indeed can be our own beta bucks and fuck as many young alphas as we want older men are essentially just beta bux theres a reason christian grey was and not or once women stop pretending and stop getting real things are going to get interesting really really quick
PurplePillDebate,removed,a post midlife hag bagging alphas of course not an in shape cougar bagging a different alpha every night it happens every day and can not be disputed
PurplePillDebate,removed,are you as in shape as the average guy on the bodybuilding forums if not then you arent alpha besides alpha men dont talk about women and the things red pillers talk about they are too busy living life
PurplePillDebate,removed,but youre the one in denial older men are beta bucks to women older women are fuckable even if not the first choice to men there was some survey from pornhub recently that sited milf porn as being the most popular with teen coming in second you simply hate the fact that an older in shape woman can get alpha dick while an older man is beta bux and has to pay for pussy one way or the other while young alphas get laid without spending or having a dime
PurplePillDebate,removed,no women only realize half of that im not sure if you guys already know this or not but most women cheat some more than others we already know we can get laid we just have to be sneaky about it what you should be afraid of is women realizing they can be their own beta bucks
PurplePillDebate,removed,by answering my question you just stepped into my frame and you call yourself alpha you are literally beta as you just put me first
PurplePillDebate,removed,what does your body look like
PurplePillDebate,removed,pics with proof
PurplePillDebate,removed,many women are living the life described in the op
PurplePillDebate,removed,i rest my case
PurplePillDebate,removed,you made a statement about your body and i asked for proof you refuse to provide so your argument is dismissed
PurplePillDebate,removed,it doesnt matter the women im talking about in the op are only interested in their careers and sex so flings are ideal as far as stds do you say the same thing to men who want to sleep around and why act so salty with that last line does the thought of a woman enjoying casual sex and not seeing any value in relationships with men hurt your feelings that much
PurplePillDebate,removed,proof would be holding up a piece of paper with your username the date and the time in front of your body obviously sorry but doesnt red pill say men are logical and women arent if thats the case why am i explaining basic things to you
PurplePillDebate,removed,well as a red pill woman what do you personally believe do you think a man in that position not getting a specific sex act that was provided to an ex is justifiably angry how about the woman not getting gifts or commitment before sex the way the mans ex did is she justifiably angry
PurplePillDebate,removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,removed,in reality its the exact opposite you guys are full of projections and you think youre fooling people but you arent its really obvious and clear that you are jealous of both women and attractive men
PurplePillDebate,removed,yeah slutty people are fun but i would never settle down with a non virgin guy
PurplePillDebate,removed,rhomoeroticfanfiction rtheredpill
PurplePillDebate,removed,paging ubiggerdthanyou
PurplePillDebate,removed,give or take a lot
PurplePillDebate,removed,lets see a picture of her
PurplePillDebate,removed,pretty much what i expected she isnt hot enough to prove any points
PurplePillDebate,removed,make more money to buy hookers and cocaine with
PurplePillDebate,removed,they need to swallow the red pill
PurplePillDebate,removed,translation my anecdote trumps the generality so neener feel better about yourself

PurplePillDebate,removed,the mainstay of feminism has literally zero issue with the beneficial parts of feminity when you actually think about it feminism is toxic feminity through and through feminism sees equality as a buffet they gladly take male advantages but without any responsibility and especially without giving away any female advantages to avoid the logical backlash against this cherrypicking they use the queen of female advantages manipulating men by combining helplessness and shamingexclusion the former incites protective urges the second incites fear it works almost flawlessly in the context of feminism helplessness refers to the crass hypoagency narrative that modern feminists push basically any problem women face is caused by external factorsactors example patriarchy conspiracy and must be solved by external factorsactors example constant cries for big daddy government feminist shamingexclusion refers to the angry accusing tone which permeates their discourse and the excessive use of using sexual selection to get men on party line example invasion of nerdy male spaces
PurplePillDebate,removed,im sure you are buddy
PurplePillDebate,removed,httpwwwpressreadercom
PurplePillDebate,removed,you made a big deal about it by posting hence the so neener section of my translation
PurplePillDebate,removed,someone cant read
PurplePillDebate,removed,sounds like someone peaked in hs
PurplePillDebate,removed,with assholes of your caliber definitely
PurplePillDebate,removed,
PurplePillDebate,removed,every society has rules and obligations centered around sex and the purpose of following those rules is to obtain the benefit of sex and the obligations go both ways sorry to disappoint you stop being ignorant of history the state got involved in marriage to control inheritance and political power moving from one generation to the next all the other shit is tertiary at its most basic marriage is still an economic agreement if you believe that it was put into place to control behavior or make sure everyone gets a fair chance to fuck you have no idea what the fuck is going on
PurplePillDebate,removed,they are not
PurplePillDebate,removed,well that was a lazy and stupid comment but hey trpers yeah bye
PurplePillDebate,removed,not just suicide but depression too
PurplePillDebate,removed,welp this thread has boosted my confidence a lot because these dudes are ugged out af
PurplePillDebate,removed,society never gave a shit if everyone got married or not equal access is not granted never has been try again reading comprehension does wonders
PurplePillDebate,removed,why are you pretending to be autistic
PurplePillDebate,removed,you can do that if you want just dont be surprised when they end up doing this
PurplePillDebate,removed,nah even though i basically never agree with skinny and think his arguments are flimsy at best oftentimes outright nonsensical or flatout denial like the one above unlike ssw he doesnt seem to be intentionally trolling to me
PurplePillDebate,removed,and once again mr awesome with the big penis writes humblebrag about how awesome he is please tell me mr awesom why do your experiences invalidate events like finklegate where it was blatantly obvious that feminists rushed in to defend alyssa bereznak and her right to demand that the filthy nerd jon finkel reveal that he played magic the gathering so that she wasnt tricked
PurplePillDebate,removed,listen you are sexist cause you think that vagina means a mom is supposed to take care of kids for free and pretend its not worth anything while the man works on his career and ego and she better stay at home and stfu and not complain right oh boy ive seen the choices youve made as a so called adult as evidenced by your diatribes and sexist rants that seem to have no end your circular arguments your sad logic your poor wife but shes young and dumb and youll trap her and shell resent you eventually cause your game is flawed and shell see your inferiority complex and youll have to lift even more weight but oh wait your testosterone will start to drop cause youre getting older before you know it itll be you whos trapped in dread and hopefully your wife will still love youshe probably will but you wont see it cause you are so insecure thats why you need to shit on women cause you are insecure make sure hide it from your rats as long as you can
PurplePillDebate,removed,no one get to make fun of my brother but me you can go die in a fire have a good day lady
PurplePillDebate,removed,you take pride in that jesus
PurplePillDebate,removed,it makes sense my friend and i tend to do pretty well because the gap between a guy who doesnt care about public opinion and the extremely feminine guy has been made so large by feminist erosion of society sort of like classes the middle is dying out there arent a lot of guys in the market who arent either assholes or sissies so rather than try to test the waters the girls just bline for the best they can get youll see those ugly or alternative chicks with guys who often threaten suicide to preserve the relationship or have very effeminate behaviours and the attractive girls are with the manly and often tall guys
PurplePillDebate,removed,she is all he can get if you never get laid or manage to get a girl that seems way out of your league you still acknowledge how disgusting her past is but you deal with it because of the aforementioned reasons this is the big one for why so many bp women on here are so deluded about n count i have never met such a weirdo creepo little virgin guy who cares about a womans n count my hubby knows my extensive past and he doesnt care one bit uhhh yeah because hes a beta and you just prob gave him slimey tornado head mins ago so of course hes going to say nah baby
PurplePillDebate,removed,like of the posts on ppd what in the fuck does this have to do with the pills take your garbage elsewhere
PurplePillDebate,removed,am i attractive enough to get away with being direct or do i need better pics dont dox me but honestly im tired of hiding behind a username
PurplePillDebate,removed,really because you sound like a femboy who gets whipped by a fat sjw warlord
PurplePillDebate,removed,ah yes all those sjws causing social suicide to men that go around calling any woman that wont sleep with him a slut maybe you know dont be a fucking asshole but no its all the sjw and womens fault
PurplePillDebate,removed,youre fucking crazy you seriously thought because i was agreeing with someones posts that i was doubleposting or using a bot
PurplePillDebate,removed,this idiot legitimately thinks that your account is a bot or a sockpuppet used to signal boost my perspective guess thats a compliment to one of us or something
PurplePillDebate,removed,your husband is likely a bp cuck though
PurplePillDebate,removed,no i simply wanted to call you out for being intellectually lazy and disingenuous
PurplePillDebate,removed,transgenders are definitely a thing a freakish mutant abomination of a thing that ought to be killed with fire but still a thing yes
PurplePillDebate,removed,le sigh
PurplePillDebate,removed,what experience do you have with this guys girlfriend how about this im gonna show you how your argument works you must be hideous like you must be really ugly either fat or hairy or trollish in some way this is not my imagination its my experience talking you belong to the red pill right why would you need their help unless you werent really ugly so youre ugly im right and youre wrong until you dox yourself to prove otherwise
PurplePillDebate,removed,in bp says not all women like muscles
PurplePillDebate,removed,i literally cant think of any reason why some women would support immigrationrefugees except for feeling bad about the refugees altruism i feel like when someone is being altruistic it should be in the most meaningful direct personal way there is too much of a disconnect when its something as simple as signing a paper to help hypothetical people i dont think anyone is altruistic except those who have accepted death in your example i would assume those people just want to feel good about themselves perhaps they feel some guilt and therefore try to help others to feel better about themselves its like giving change to a homeless dude
PurplePillDebate,removed,hahahahahahahaha
PurplePillDebate,removed,bahahahahahaahhah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this exactly women want freedom to be sluts for chad and a completely deregulated capitalist smp yet demand more women in stem and cry about gender pay gap they cry sexism when men prove to naturally be better workers but then turn around and say whatever its just nature when women abuse their years of peak fertility to ride the cock carousel is it gynocentrism or the hypocrisy of feminism or the whippedness of our men who knows
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sips vodka i agree brother we should take back working class sexual market for the people and dissolve the proletariat and start year communist regime if some bitter loser cant make a girl want to fuck him tough shit guess he has to die alone yeah not everyone can be winners in this world people who wanna get married are still gonna get fucking married like jesus
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it seems to me the women youre complaining about arent necessarily the same as the women receiving the bulk of government support im sure theres some overlap but im assuming youre talking more about party girls in college and the like not teen moms and impoverished women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is where men are stupid you know that sex can make a woman pregnant so you need to protect yourself especially in the us with a tradcon government thats fixing to drastically restrict abortion she said she was on birth control so i didnt use a condom is not an excuse nor is it doesnt feel as good rub one out and clear your head before you do anything stupid an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure gentlemen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what i am most amused by is that all the desperate bitter men on here who bitch about women wanting a world that is stateregulated so that they can have special privileges actually advocate for the exact same thing themselves the patriarchy was basically welfare sex for lowvalue men the state created laws that barred women from entering universities owning property having safe abortions having the vote this way women survived by keeping themselves virgin for thirsty unworthy men they did not want who would then provide for them financially in exchange of sex these men do want the state and the laws to enter their bedrooms only they want the state to be all about enslaving women never believe their bullshit about it being women who want the mommy state the only reason why many of them were not genetically weeded out generations ago was the mommy state providing welfare sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also women have no right to expect that hard working guy in his to marry them or give them a ltr when they need it or to marry single mothers that get knocked up the problem with feminism is they want to govt to pay for those single moms from the taxes of beta men they have been rejecting ergo its really not a free market
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so my point is if women dont want to have sex with unattractive men because this violates their freedom more power to them but then they have no right to violate someones else freedom in order to fund their life choices you were spot on until this section women dont want to have sex with unattractive men because wait for it they are unattractive it has nothing to do with freedom you need to explain how women are violating mens freedoms as you claim is this just more divorce rape stuff
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,despite rapidly changing attitudes marriageraising children is still as much if not more an economical project as a romantic one it requires absurd amounts of invesments of time money and dedication over literally decades and in the modern world with the importance of education and other investments in childs future it only became more expensive at least if done properly needless to say it can be stupidly hard to pull it off solo or with porrly contributing partner none of that matters tho just look at poor communities black america is good example the proverbial canary in the coal mine we are sexual creatures and we will place this urge first before any cerebral ideas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am not sure i am getting what you are saying here so allow me to reiterate you seem to express some sort of afbb dichotomy what you are saying is that if a woman doesnt find a man attractive than she shouldnt be extracting resources out of him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where im from of social welfare recipients are women quite a lot of that gender difference is elderly widows who took large amounts of time out of the workforce to raise kids but have not been provided for in their old age in essence a failure of traditional families to provide im just not seeing a lot of justification for what you are saying there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont have kids and spend your money on yourself winning d
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,under our laws once a man has been stupid enough to marry he has no freedoms only liabilities
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the current system of women having casual sex with a small group of men that invest in them has never happened in human history except in really primitive tribes in africa and certain amazon rainforest tribes that never invented the wheel what were living through right now is a radical outlier with women being aggressively sold shortterm pleasure over longterm fulfillment while society might change men and women have not and like in all of history women with their current powers and privileges today are just aimless children playing in traffic using very simple common sense if a large portion of men say which is what its looking like go and die alone how is that not also true for women especially those in lowinvestment childless relationships with chad for men a life time of loneliness means theyll be hardened and accustomed to it and expecting it when it comes in old age but for women in their and very early with limitless suitors undeserved attention and large circles of singleserving female friends well dont be surprised if the female suicide rate matches the current male one imagine you get into your thinking youre the coolest funniest most creative and sassy gods gift to men to ever live then overnight you completely vanish even women with millions of dollars and fame like madonna are transformed into shells of themselves and national laughing stocks in their quest to stay relevant and young
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you have a hammer everything looks like a nail and if you are a redpiller i suppose everything looks like a plot to rob you of the sex you are owed gross i support universal health care and family leave policies not because i have some secret sexual agenda but because those are ethical policies and should be perfectly attainable in one of the richest countries in the world for most of the progressive issues that are important to me personally climate change access to health care criminal justice reform etc gender the sexual marketplace is completely irrelevant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but women can ride the cc and go into stem we should have more women in stem we should also have the freedom to fuck whoever we want to fuck just like men these things are not mutually exclusive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree brother comrade
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe my wording wasnt clear since you are not the first to misunderstand me but i wasnt complaining about any party girl not sleeping with me or any other man for that reason i totally support their right to chose i have a problem with people that switch from far right wild capitalism positions on sexual market to lefty ones when it somes to the economy the funny thing is that in one case they would say that its unethical to limit people freedom and in the other its unethical to leave those in need the fact that in both cases freedom of one group is conflicted with the needs of the other doesnt come to their minds for some reason some extremly flexible ethics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think you can disconnect the two teen moms and impoverished women are still women women who are enjoying an enormous amount of state support thats seemingly deliberately obfuscated by the litany of three and four letter bureaucracies and government programs you weep for the teen mom and impoverished woman i weep for the man who doesnt get laid a day in his life and is forced to pay for the former either you get welfare or you dont but if were gonna agree to some welfare which i suspect we will then it cannot just be welfare that satisfies what women value
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she said she was on birth control so i didnt use a condom is not an excuse but it should be lying about it should be illegal when someone scams you to get your money they are the ones getting punished suddenly if they lie about bc the victim of lies is punished
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wasnt even thinking about child support but it applies too i guess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe women should also insist that a guy use a condom too though ive been with women who insisted that i dont use a condom ive been asked to take it off during sex before there have been a few times where i have but most of the time i say no it can be really tempting to just go raw in the heat of the moment especially cause it feels better but then again when im wearing a condom i can last longer so it usually works out in both our favors just hate that gross rubbery condom smell
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think in an ideal world guys would be smarter about this but a crucial component of this is that everybody would be educated there is a lot of misinformation out there people of both genders thinking that pulling out is effective birth control for instance or guys being unaware of the exacty consequences of pregnancies the extent of their obligations for example im curious why you are so comfortable condemning people for ignorance when the knowledge isnt always offered to them if they know about it but the feeling of condomless sex is more important then i agree with you you reap what you sow and certainly many guys fall into this camp but some people do not have access to the same information you did growing up if a girl had very lax security on her phone and her nudes got very easily leaked would you say well you shouldve been more careful now the consequences are yours to handle i dont think that would be very cool either we should strive to both educate people so that these things dont happen but also aim to help them especially if they were not informed enough to behave intelligently
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she said she was on birth control so i didnt use a condom i agree this is stupid i would never trust anybody else with something that has such massive consequences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes under patriarchy the smv was regulated and highly socialized society put strong pressures on women to get married and shamed them mercilessly if they did not choose marriage and children or a religious life as a nun this was bad i support the complete deregulation of the smv let people make whatever choices they want all i ask is that celibacy also be accepted as a valid perfectly liberated choice patriarchy or society pressures men especially into sex and relationships
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the patriarchy was basically welfare sex for lowvalue men and it lasted for hundreds of generations the postpatriarchal society has yet to prove its staying power i dont support either feminism of patriarchy but feminism has yet to prove it can be patriarchys equal in sheer staying power let alone surpass it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,modern feminism is a state sponsored welfare program for single moms and worthless post wall sluts attempting to give them options based on the government dime through beta male taxes patriarchy was far more symmetrical in obligations between the sexes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,these men do want the state and the laws to enter their bedrooms only they want the state to be all about enslaving women yep
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what i am most amused by is that all the desperate bitter men on here who bitch about women wanting a world that is stateregulated so that they can have special privileges actually advocate for the exact same thing themselves except there are none such men here right now there are multiple threads on ppd front page about deregulating smp and the common theme that can be almost universally seen from trpers is that deregulated smp is perfectly ok if the economic marketplace is deregulated as well so the exact opposite to what you wrote theywe want im terribly unsuccessful with women but thats not what really fucks me up its the fact i have to finance the whole shitshow via my taxes if i didnt have to i would have no problem with women whoring with chads while not noticing me at all let them do what they want but then let me do what i want with my money as well in fact contrary to what you claim its the blues and of women who are the fucking hypocrites as many people already wrote in the smp you advocate unfettered free for all darwinism while in the economic marketplace you suddenly care about all those left behind and all that just because it fits you you blues feminists have no values and moral compass barring does it benefit me and i hold you in deep contempt for that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what i am most amused by is that all the desperate bitter men on here who bitch about women wanting a world that is stateregulated so that they can have special privileges actually advocate for the exact same thing themselves we can agree here the patriarchy was basically welfare sex for lowvalue men the state created laws that barred women from entering universities owning property having safe abortions having the vote this way women survived by keeping themselves virgin for thirsty unworthy men they did not want who would then provide for them financially in exchange of sex aaaaaand back to feminist history again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the government should make the fathers who created those babies pay oh but somehow its not their faaaaullllltt right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,damn yall heads are fucked up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the taxes taken from low smv men go to support the women that rejected them and the offspring of their higher smv rivals hence mgtow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women dont make the government pay for their kids the dead beat dads who ditch their responsibilities do it takes people to make a baby so both people are financially responsible for it until it is if dad has ditched is the government supposed to let the baby starve
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women dont want to have sex with unattractive men because wait for it they are unattractive it has nothing to do with freedom of course they dont want to sleep with them because they are unattractive and modern society wants to stop it because it violates women freedom you need to explain how women are violating mens freedoms as you claim is this just more divorce rape stuff men outearn women on average and have more combined assets any attempt at wealth redistribution from wealthy to poor is money transfer from men to women as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,marriage with heavily penalized sex outside of it was an example of how it was done in the past
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rewind history about years in america
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we are sexual creatures and we will place this urge first before any cerebral ideas and suffer for it after
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have you read my post i dont think any sex is owed to me i support the far right position about sexual marketplace that most bloops hold no one intitled to anything i just want some goddamn consisntency from them if its unethical to forcefeed people some colletivist bs on one side of the street it shouldnt change on the other
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i support universal health care and family leave policies not because i have some secret sexual agenda i dont think the more red people here are accusing you of having some secret sexual agenda youre just not considering the longterm implications of your infinite nostringsattached free stuff on the opposite sex and when those possibilities are expressed to you most men will probably live their lives never having gotten laid as women fuck societys chads your response is tellingly meh like first off why are we supposed to give your doomsday scenarios any time of day when you just as baselessly brush ours off secondly if your response to the possibility of tremendously widespread lifelong suffering of half of the human population is meh why are you shocked that some men think and say that your movement can go fuck itself but because those are ethical policies and should be perfectly attainable in one of the richest countries in the world the richest countries on this mile wide ball surrounded by completely fucking empty space are still constrained by the laws of thermodynamics which drive the economic scarcity that make your nostringsattached free stuff quite unattainable or more accurately unsustainable you can attain them for a generation or two for most of the progressive issues that are important to me personally climate change access to health care criminal justice reform etc gender the sexual marketplace is completely irrelevant and if men werent idiots none of them would be voting for your platform until it gave a shit about them unfortunately it doesnt but plenty of them just dont care disagree or hate themselves and their maleness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are making a massive simultaneous ad hominem and straw man he point blank said he supported individual freedom for women he just thinks that women should have to fend for themselves rather than receiving government benefits he thinks we should have an unregulated smp and an unregulated economy modern feminists want unregulated smp and regulated economy to support their unregulated smp access
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why does the aca cover diaphragms sponges birth control pills vaginal rings intrauterine devices iuds emergency contraception sterilization procedures for women but not services related to a mans reproductive capacity such as vasectomies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women very few httpimgurcomaaodnxh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not at all if you can handle the difficulty mathematics and algorithms programming can be quite rewarding and fascinating even
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they want to be in whatever field pays the most they dont care about the responsibilities that go with the positions they simply know that they want to get paid when they do get the responsibilities theyll complain about it and claim that they are being oppressed it doesnt have to make sense it just has to fit in the scheme of i want to make a lot of money and i dont want to have to do much or anything for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youd be surprised how many normal cube farmers take stem type courses and have mainstream non health non computer jobs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok i understand but i think youre failing to take into account what appear to be hypocritical conflicting beliefs but which still fall in line with the same basic value system womenmen having sexualrelationship options is still a liberal value despite liberals believing in helping the poor they will prioritize certain freedoms over others most liberals dont look at freedom from taxation as if its the same as freedom to choose who your partners are but i understand how this can seem hypocritical to people who have different belief systems
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the welfare isnt just what satisfies women its basic care food shelter healthcare its available to men as well im not weeping for anyone in particular i just believe these things are necessary and that some amount of taxes are justified for them im not a communist i think it needs to be reasonable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah she might have been on birth control it might have failed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but it should be lying about it should be illegal if you think a woman lying about birth control should be illegal then should a guy who lies about his job in order to get laid be illegal too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant think of any other way that a woman would violate someone elses freedom if were just talking marriage youre free to not marry whoever you want nobodys gonna march you to the altar if you dont want to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive been with women who insisted that i dont use a condom ive been asked to take it off during sex before there have been a few times where i have but most of the time i say no smart guy youre only setting yourself up for a world of risk unless you know and trust this person and even then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive been with women who insisted that i dont use a condom ive been asked to take it off during sex before im surprised by this but then as a female i dont typically fuck other females with condoms have any other guys had the same experience i mean i get raw sex being hot for women in theory and i get females foolishly opting out of condoms as a heatofthemoment thing and i even get women who kinda sorta want babies stupidly tempting fate by getting laxer with precautions but for the female to request that you take it off midway through fucking i mean is that a kink thing a sensation thing or a letsrollthediceaboutababy thing i cant figure out where this ladys head was at
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe women should also insist that a guy use a condom too though they should but each person can only be responsible for themselves and cant control other people so if a guy is with the type of woman who doesnt insist on it he should remember to bring one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but some people do not have access to the same information you did growing up as far as the us goes i grew up with some of the worst sex ed imaginable red state deep trump country we still knew that sex makes babies from about grade on if a girl had very lax security on her phone and her nudes got very easily leaked would you say well you shouldve been more careful now the consequences are yours to handle if they were stolen thats theft she did not consent to anyone seeing them if she sent them to someone who then sent them to his buddies thats a lesson in trust or lack thereof
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are not shamed for being alone they simply find themselves at a certain point surrounded by friends in their who are all married and socialise as a couple there is no more clubbing and partying and they may live very lonely lives if they do not settle down which is why they do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,society did not stay together because of patriarchy but because of constant improvement in quality of life and technological inventions if anything since feminism happened standards of life have improved again because of technology
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the women you speak of are a small percentage of the female population and taxes are paid by women as well so beta males are not to be praised for doing anything special and a lot of money is used for sick and disabled men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres plenty of low value guys in my country being given government unemployment andor disability payments to make their lives more safe and tolerable and im just fine with my taxes going to that too would you be happier with the situation if your country was more willing to pay benefits to people of both genders without children in their care thus paying out more to men who are in dire financial situations or do you just fucking hate poor people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right i forgot that for the protrump red pill edgelords simple facts they do not like fake history fake
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its common knowledge that women married or of economic necessity in the past that is not controversial
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,remember that in the past during patriarchy the fathers had to actually marry the women who got pregnant im sure a lot of guys would find that to be even worse than paying child support
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the government should make the womens families pay women have the decision making power when it comes to reproductive rights so their family foots the bill tammy gets an abortion via medicad and her first second and third degree of kin get taxed to pay for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is that fucked up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one is talking about wealth redistribution that makes no sense in your op
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all the more reason to get women at the top so that the money transfer is not men to women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so whats the punishment for men who have sex outside of marriage under your system
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im sorry i guess i wasnt clear i believe that the position that unattractive men arent owed sex is perfectly consistent with collectivist ideas like universal health care which also benefits men obviously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah ok climate change wont affect men and criminal justice reform wouldnt benefit them got it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it certainly should cover vasectomies in the uk the nhs covers them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you can handle the difficulty mathematics and algorithms programming it cannot be understated the level of difficulty this is at even a moderately tough school dont expect to have any weekends or friendships outside your immediate classmates especially during junior year
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,from my pov my gripe with liberalism is simply this they seem to pick and choose when freedom is ideal or regulation is needed based on their own opinion of an ideal outcome some of us consider an equally unfair solution to be ideal if a solution cannot be present that is equally fair to everyone and when it comes to the smp im in the camp that thinks equally unfair may be the best route for a stable society i may not even like the solution but if i am as affected by it as everyone else shrug
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fall in line with the same basic value system i believe that basic value system should be based on some fundamental principles that are applied across the board freedom from taxation is not in conflict with freedom to choose who your partners freedom to chose your actions is in conflict with the need to keep those at the bottom afloat and other duties to the society when you decide that basic principle can be applied selectively to one spheres and its complete opposite to other spheres there is always a question who is the judge which spheres would be decided by which principle and how do we prevent this judge from basing his decisions on self interest this is where the ethics is lost in my opinion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the welfare isnt just what satisfies women its basic care food shelter healthcare tens of thousands of dollars annually and again youre assuming that a women and men make use of these things equally we know that isnt the case with healthcare and b women and men value these things equally probably a safe assumption with food i just believe these things are necessary and that some amount of taxes are justified for them great so invariably you are agreeing that a portion of my labor should nonnegotiably be taken in order to fund other people so that they may live a better life im not sure whether i agree or not ideally no social darwinism makes better humans pragmatically yes liberals exist thus i dont see why its such a stretch to suggest then that if we care about social outcomes we strengthen monogamy which improves social cohesion outcomes and stability by virtue of there not being a bunch of sexually frustrated purposeless men running around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which i bet is easy to verify by a simple blood test wont it show that the hormone levels are different if she wasnt lying if indeed it failed then yes she shouldnt be charged or anything yet its not a mans fault or responsibility its her side of bc that failed so she should take care of that like sue the company that made that bc or whatever after all if a man uses condom but it doesnt work that man is made accountable for the pregnancy and is punished for having a condom that didnt work
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes to an extent he already is rape by deception is a thing and impersonating somebody to get sex is illegal depends on a place of course like there was that state where only impersonating husband was illegal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not talking about a woman im talking about general wealth redistribution
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have any other guys had the same experience yep had the exact same experience its the woman who tells me dont wear a condom usually not the other way around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i find it irritating even though im not allergic i used other methods but some guys want to use condoms as back up i only have piv in a relationship for this reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just figured that she didnt like the feeling of a condom inside her or something personally i find that latexy condom smell really off putting plus you just feel closer to them without one theres something about being inside a girl without that little rubber barrier that just feels really good and really close to them im sure some women feel this way too my ex girlfriend wanted me to cum inside her and we agreed prior shed just get a morning after pill she was really turned on by it theres probably something going on at an animalneurological level with it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure you knew sex made babies did you know that pulling out was a completely terrible way to avoid pregnancy did you know that birth control could fail and were you sure enough of this that if a girl had said its ok im on birth control you wouldve not listened to her im guessing youre actually a girl but you know what i mean did you know what your legal obligations were if you got pregnant did you know that condoms had some nonzero failure rate do you claim that every yearold in the us has had every opportunity to learn all these things and more not just sex makes babies if they were stolen i was making a general point of somebody could do something thats largely their fault but that doesnt mean we should callously just respond by saying well you should have known better but now that you mention it isnt a woman who deliberately lies about her birth control to trap a guy with a pregnancy look im not saying this is at all common just that it does happen committing a crime you could argue that its hard to enforce like one can claim that they were on bc and it just failed but shouldnt it at least theoretically be a crime should we throw our hands up at trying for justice because its hard to do so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are not shamed for being alone a glance at any feminist literature reveals that to be untrue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no there are certain fields where youre expected to be married by a certain age oldschool maledominated fields like law or government have these expectations also people wonder about a person especially a male who hasnt had any kind of romantic experience at age or people wonder why a dude doesnt ever mention girlfriends or boyfriends doesnt ever contribute to talk about relationships men arent shamed for being alone per se but they definitely are shamed for not having relationship experience past a certain age
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,technology invented exclusively by beta males born in a patriarchy women have yet to prove they can invent shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont know much about history if you think constant improvement in quality of life and technological inventions was the norm before the industrial revolution yet patriarchy goes back to before the adoption of writing nobody knows exactly how it contributed or how much but it certainly is an absolute constant in all somewhat organized societies throughout known time until the century its hard not to think youre an mra posing as a caricature but apparently you believe this stuff
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,would you be happier with the situation if your country was more willing to pay benefits to people of both genders without children in their care thus paying out more to men who are in dire financial situations no or do you just fucking hate poor people no i just want to keep my money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id prefer a country where governments did not create the welfare state its inefficient and creates a relationship between the poor and the state that is more akin to a drug dealer than a mentor and benefactor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your history isnt incorrect the fact that you dont address the fact that now youre replacing husband with state while getting a ruthlessly individualist sexual marketplace is bullshit have your ruthless individualist sexual marketplace i do just fine in that area but then you also need my labor for your inadequates that have anxiety and thats why they cant get a job gtfo thats bullshit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,economic factors influence romantic decisios even today thats not new but thats not exactly what she said
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the man rolls the dice when he sleeps with a woman she may get pregnant it doesnt matter what happens after she gets pregnant he is half responsible for creating it therefore he is half responsible for the aftermath period
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just how yall say things like the world is ending like how do you wake up every morning thinking half the world is that awful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am talking about wealth redistribution if you support one group of people to face the results of their poor choiceslike you do in the sexual market the internally consistent position would be to also support this in other instanceslike the actual market
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you think that quota forcing men out of high earning position is somhow different then direct money extraction we would have to disagree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men have higher variance in iq so while there are more male retards there are also more male geniuses this means based upon intelligence alone it makes more sense that there are more men at the top if you want more women at the top then find more ways to give them genetic variance so they can compete with the top percentage of men who win the genetic intellectual lottery unless you somehow think that more intelligent people should not be at the top and that there should be more women because they have a vagina instead of a brain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not as much a disincentive as the incentives for marriage are
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is that my system it stopped existing before i was even born
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,their wallets get cored out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,welcome to red pill fantasy land
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how could you apply the idea that we should force people to help unfortunate ones in order to achieve more equal society in one sphere while totally neglecting it in the other and consider it consistent position which also benefits men obviously traditional marriage also benefits women obviously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope not really climate change is gonna happen whether you want it to or not because of basic economics see dont worry its not going to be the end of civilization like your favorite papers are screaming to high heaven about and criminal justice reform might make punishment more equitable but that only means making sentences equitable across races and genders and it assumes that a government solution to a government problem is likely to have any effect at all otherwise men largely being the perpetrators of most crime will still be the predominant population in prison this is okay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a fair gripe and one i have with some of my own politics as well as those in opposition both sides do this except maybe the libertarians
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when you decide that basic principle can be applied selectively to one spheres and its complete opposite to other spheres there is always a question who is the judge which spheres would be decided by which principle and how do we prevent this judge from basing his decisions on self interest this is where the ethics is lost in my opinion yep i wholeheartedly agree even though i fall into that camp i base it upon what is realisticrational as well as what i value but that of course looks hypocritical when it results in me being for things like abortiondefendants rights and yet still being progun control im ok with this because i believe its realisticrational even if it conflicts at its core ethically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tens of thousands of dollars annually and again youre assuming that most people are just getting pretty much the bare minimum not windfalls youre assuming that a women and men make use of these things equally we know that isnt the case with healthcare im not assuming that at all i know women get more im just not so sure its unjustified if they are the more impoverished ones in need great so invariably you are agreeing that a portion of my labor should nonnegotiably be taken in order to fund other people so that they may live a better life hey its my taxes too im nearing the upper class and will likely enter it pretty soon its not like im asking to opt out here my tax bracket is also a part of this thus i dont see why its such a stretch to suggest then that if we care about social outcomes we strengthen monogamy which improves social cohesion outcomes and stability by virtue of there not being a bunch of sexually frustrated purposeless men running around im not saying you shouldnt care youre entitled to your opinion mine is different as i believe these suggestions will do more damage than good and we ultimately have different values competing here its not wrong to believe what you believe nor is it wrong for me to believe differently
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no everyones body absorbs the hormones differently two women taking the same pill at the same time could have totally different levels like for example women who weigh more than lbs which isnt much especially for taller women are at much higher risk of failure on ultra low dose most common pills just due to body size fat composition affects it as does digestive upset and certain other medications or supplements she might have forgotten to take it one day or taken it at a different time iuds are much safer and not affected by user error and theyre getting more popular but really you should just wrap it up if its a risky situation condom withdrawal hopefully shes on some kind of birth control and youre almost certainly in the clear sex always carries a risk itll never be i have a friend who got pregnant on birth control using a condom and then her first abortion failed all you can do is hedge your bets if you absolutely positively cannot have a child get a vasectomy or dont have sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which i bet is easy to verify by a simple blood test you lose the bet the stuff clears from the blood pretty quickly thats the reason it is one pill per day taken at the same time of day and even if you did test and found the synthetic hormones there that doesnt mean she was on them back two weeks or more ago when she got preggers or four weeks or more ago when the gap in pills that caused the ovulation happened also a woman is supposed to stop taking bcp if she gets pregnant because of how fast that stuff clears from the body that creates a really tight timeframe to take a test in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape by deception applies to impersonating someone like a boyfriend or a husband it doesnt apply to someone saying yeah i make millions of dollars i was also football quarterback in college literally nowhere in the western world is that illegal and it shouldnt be it would be ridiculous however i do agree with you on thing intentional contraception sabotage should be illegal for example if a woman pricked a hole in a condom so she could get pregnant or if a man switched out his gfs birth control pills with fake pills but just lying about it shouldnt be because there are so many ways to make sure for example asking them to wear a condom people cant fake wearing a condom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right and nobody can force anyone to get married or give them shit the only thing anyone can be forced into is child support which is why i gave my spiel about wrapping it up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,okay im going to step out of character as a feminist for a second damn my fellow bitches be crazy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,literally of the risk in courtship falls on men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as far as actual physical sensation goes it feels exactly the same to me im a woman im sure there is a psychological component to it for a lot of people though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah okay thanks im understanding better now i guess my kneejerk reaction was what rare brand of crazy is that man fucking but that struck me as a bit judgmental and illinformed im glad i got a chance to check myself still the morning after pill as a planned thing man i like the weird stuff but thats edgy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i knew all of this except i disagree on the pull out method when done correctly its httpswwwplannedparenthoodorglearnbirthcontrolwithdrawalpulloutmethod and my so and i used it in conjunction with birth control for many years at no i didnt know all of that from school but i damn sure googled it before i had sex personal responsibility kids these days have it easier with their smartphones no lying is perjury and perjury is a civil matter not a criminal one you could attempt to sue a girl for lying about being on birth control but in guessing the judge would tell you exactly what i said in my comment birth control isnt effective anyway you should always take your protection into your own hands when you consented to unprotected sex you consented to potential biological consequences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no the men who are shamed are mgtows who do not want to be alone and simply do not date and post misogynistic abuse online because they claim modern women are degenerate thats the difference
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh really what feminist literature shames men who choose to be alone please give me the name of a piece
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and you think this does not happen to women nobody asks them why they havent got a boyfriend past a certain age
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women have yet to prove they can invent shit thats not what has to be proven what has to be proven is that a feminist society can still keep pumping out motivated beta males who will keep advancing things in my opinion i think that will continue happening with or without feminism people may or may not be more miserable but economics play a much larger part in how much innovation you see in a society
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,does not change the fact that nowadays there is still prosperity despite the collapse of the patriarchy actually there is a lot more since we cleaned up the patriarchy cesspools like victorian london where you had year old pregnant prostitutes in the streets patriarchy always leads to sexual abuse and degeneration
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youre just another boring bogstandard economic rightwinger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are aware that millions of women work and contribute in taxes as well or you think it is just your wee special snowflake labor that contributes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok but women are part of the labor market just as much as men are you could say that women who are high earners paying taxes are supporting these inadequates that youre talking about just as much as men do its not a gender thing we all feed into the system
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the aca provides birth control to include condoms to women but doesnt provide it to men while we can say he is half responsible for making the baby the responsibility is diluted by the womans access to bc before and decision making powers after sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we are saying to avoid marrying post wall used goods cc riders and single moms we also dont believe in paying for kids we didnt produce what is wrong with that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know how you square it but things are looking pretty bleak for men im pretty sure the only card we have is basically to surrpetitiously encourage feminists to abort their male fetuses which hopefully their deepseeded disdain for men will make it easy for them to do thereby shrinking the male population as a percentage of the whole in the future then those males would be valued and would probably live decent lives while women would fuck them and each other and also be just fine having been liberated from the oppression of marriage and men i wake up every morning because money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have no idea how fucked men in general are because you are a leftist and dont care if you think some people bitching on reddit about it are bad wait until the climax and backlash really starts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we had one free market economics forever the social safety net is new meanwhile throughout history the patriarchy caused a huge market distortion in the smp i am guessing you are cool with all of that now the situation is reversing and you dont like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,quotas do not exist to force men out they exist because bosses are sexist and would not hire women otherwise believing them incapable andor fearing they will get pregnant it is mens fault if we need quotas seeing how strong their misogyny is we also would not need black quotas had white men not started two distasteful little things called imperialism and slavery which led to widespread discrimination against certain groups arent you all so much in favour of personal responsibility very well then quotas exist because white men broke it and now they own it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,iq has very little to do with why people are at the top i really do wish only highiq people got the top jobs to be honest with you that law alone would get rid of trump and pence in a jiffy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are proposing we reinstate it i am asking you about your hypothetical punishment for men who cheated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ouchy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have you read the feminine mystique or done research on the prevalence of depression and substance abuse women suffered during traditional marriage when they were homemakers popping out babies how exactly does traditional marriage benefit women in the long run its a raw deal i say this as a women who is happily married to my husband by the way we both work hard and are equal partners with equal power in our relationship which to me is very different than traditional marriage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you want a regulated smp you need to just say so and then tell us how you would do it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you seem to be saying that if we have an equitable tax structure and social safety net unattractive men should be allowed to rape women who do not wish to have sex with them its only fair your logic here is extremely opaque to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except maybe the libertarians when it comes to personal privacyfreedom i tend to align with the libertarian view where i lean conservative that is republican is on the economy unfortunately the rep party likes to talk a big game but they stumble on implementation over and over again ideally id like a country that is fairly libertarian on personal rights and fairly republican as they claim to be not as they are when it comes to the economy and the military of course theres a lot of conflicting stuff between those two povs so my views on individual issues varies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great so invariably you are agreeing that a portion of my labor should nonnegotiably be taken in order to fund other people so that they may live a better life hey its my taxes too im nearing the upper class and will likely enter it pretty soon its not like im asking to opt out here my tax bracket is also a part of this difference is if the taxes werent there youd retain the right to donate that money as you saw fit to go to those same causes its right along with the if the million women who marched donated they could privately fund planned parenthood meme which hit spoton in my opinion plenty of affluent women who could cover the cost for or women for whom the wouldve been too much for im generally a filthy libertarian and so when i donate money i tend to donate it thus i dont see why its such a stretch to suggest then that if we care about social outcomes we strengthen monogamy which improves social cohesion outcomes and stability by virtue of there not being a bunch of sexually frustrated purposeless men running around im not saying you shouldnt care youre entitled to your opinion mine is different as i believe these suggestions will do more damage than good and we ultimately have different values competing here its not wrong to believe what you believe nor is it wrong for me to believe differently more importantly though its not wrong of us who see this disconnect as evidence of the duplicity of feminism and refuse to identify with it oppose it and encourage others to do the same mens lives are not valued in that movement unless their lives are being spent yammering on about feminist talking points and even then that movement slanders and misrepresents the experiences and intentions of the overwhelming majority of men and it demonizes them how some men view that movement as one of equality is absolutely utterly baffling to me i would have ten times the respect for a movement that was straightforward about the realities of the world
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,absolutely dont have sex is a solution so no reason to pay for bc for women or men yes those things with different masses and fat compositions are what i wasnt sure about however you can still calibrate the test for each body type or can add some chemical to all bc that can be traced well and finally she might have forgotten to take it one day or taken it at a different time this right here is exactly what makes she told me she was on bc a valid excuse in the quoted scenario it is her fault and a man should have an option to opt out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,alright then they can come up with the way for it not to clear from blood fast it cant be that hard to add some marker theres no need to this now because its not a widely spread thing to check if a person was lying about bc because who cares the current obviously unfair system assumes that a man takes risk but a woman somehow doesnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,alright then they can come up with the way for it not to clear from blood fast it cant be that hard to add some marker theres no need to this now because its not a widely spread thing to check if a person was lying about bc because who cares the current obviously unfair system assumes that a man takes risk but a woman somehow doesnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they can remove it in the process or punch a hole in it like you said any type of lying should be illegal just because it isnt right now it doesnt mean its right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but you can be taxed into oblivion which can be spent on single parent support programs maternity leaves etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really weve used a condom twice curiosity and both times it was pretty obviously worse on the sensation front
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats a little much for me too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you must have a different definition of quite effective from me even looking at your source it says the failure rate is estimated at if always done perfectly of course if you mean in conjunction with other methods it can help then sure but thats not what i meant when i said it was ineffective i was talking about pulling out by itself which many people seem to think is enough at no i didnt know all of that from school but i damn sure googled it thats very responsible of you i still think expecting yearolds to google things to fully legally protect themselves is more than a bit unfair and unrealistic it will be hard for you to convince me that nearly all yearold men in the us fully understand everything above including for example the idea that they have no legal recourse if the mother decides to keep the baby and demand child support some nontrivial percentage of old americans dont know how to calculate of there is no way the general public is sufficiently educated no lying is perjury and perjury is a civil matter not a criminal one actually lying about stds for example is a criminal matter its not clear why lying about something that could result in years of forced payments should be any less birth control isnt effective anyway you should always take your protection into your own hands i agree with this i dont agree with how you think people who do not do this should be treated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no youre literally the only feminist ive ever read make that distinction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think this does happen to women women are more shamed for a lack of relationship experience while male virgins are shamed more than female ones sometimes older or year old male virgins are suspected of hiding something far more sinister and vile than being gay if their social status is also very low this doesnt happen to women still you had a good point on how women without relationship experience catch shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you could say that women who are high earners paying taxes are supporting these inadequates that youre talking about just as much as men do but theyre not for one they dont make as much money as men do on the whole and for two they are overwhelmingly more beneficiaries of these social programs than men are there are programs that specifically target women there are none or at the very most very few and with very little funding for men its not the same and that recent study we saw from new zealand indicated that as a group and thats in a country with a significantly smaller gender pay gap than ours
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but men have even more access to birth control any man of any age can walk into almost any gas station and buy condone which are effective for a woman to get birth control she has to be a certain age make a doctors appointment pay for that pay for the bc then wait a month for the bc to kick in oh yeah and there are side effects both genders have a responsibility to use bc it is both peoples fault if she gets pregnant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,idk i just read comments like that in a dramatic tearful voice in my head but maybe im just crazy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im left leaning
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never stated i was cool with one market beeing distorted what do you mean by patriarchy caused a huge market distortion in the smp do you think that some sort of wrongdoing to some people in the past justifies wrongdoing to other people in the future
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah if women fail that must be because something evil outside their control prevented them from success to be honest i know men with some external power is always forcing me to fail attitude as well they never achieve anything and die alone drowning in alcohol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think trump socially engineered this election beautifully to assume he doesnt know what hes doing is just your own prejudice clouding your judgment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are proposing we reinstate it i am not i provided example of how one could regulate smp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe im here for too short time and such epic fail is standard on their part but i will be surprised if after this utter fiasco they will still try to act as if their opinions and values and even they themselves are worth debating a human who can advocate such sharp inconsistency is in my eyes automatically disqualified in any possible debate not that it would matter or change the world in any way but these threads show very clearly to anyone who didnt see so far that feminism or bp generally is just a pile of bullshit used to justify blatant gynocentrism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have you read the feminine mystique or done research on the prevalence of depression and substance abuse women suffered during traditional marriage when they were homemakers popping out babies how exactly does traditional marriage benefit women in the long run its a raw deal oh give me a break ive done research on the prevelance of depression and substance abuse among top executives in big companies now lets draw conclusion how all this monay and power are a raw deal for them if you need details on how marriage benefits women uanitapk is more than equipped to give you a detailed answere from the other side
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but thats not what hes saying you want a deregulated individualist pull yourself up by your bootstraps sexual marketplace and have no empathy for a man who spends his life never getting laid never being desired now i think thats pretty fucked up and a terrible life but i accept that that mans suffering is not reason to deprive another person of their agency i cant force someone to fuck that guy but when we argue the same thing on the economic side oh suddenly that suffering is of utmost importance and how dare you not want to part with a percentage of your labor and your finite time alive to provide for the people without its rank hypocrisy and you guys think you can get away with it by erecting a classic leftist arbitrary barrier between this activity and that one essentially if you want to force me to give up some of my labor and time for the less fortunate then you have to force her to do the same get rid of nofault divorce at a minimum child support should at the very least be considered as a function of a fathers income and alimony should be pretty fucking rare in this world of dualincome dualworker dualeducated households on the flip side if the unattractive are supposed to be hung out to dry sexually then fuck your social programs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont and i stated it in the op
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats totally what im saying despite never mentioning the word rape once
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where i lean conservative that is republican is on the economy unfortunately the rep party likes to talk a big game but they stumble on implementation over and over again the rep party is pretty profree market for businesses especially their big corporation donors in fact even the dem party is pretty profree market for businesses especially their big corporation donors this is why im losing hope in the dem party theyre becoming one and the same with the rep party economically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whos paying for bc for women theyre paying for it with their health insurance premiums if you take what she says what anyone says at face value and dont take steps to protect yourself youre a fool similarly if i sell you a shitty car and tell you its on great shape and you take me at my word and buy it you have no legal recourse when it breaks down i mean you can try to sue me but good luck i didnt do anything wrong for all anyone knows i thought the car was in great shape you didnt do your due diligence you have to protect yourself now if i somehow forced you to buy the car against your will then you have a case similarly if a woman got pregnant by raping or assaulting you youd also have a case fortunately condoms withdrawal are very effective methods of male birth control and vasectomies are even more effective i dont understand why guys insist on having risky sex even pregnancy aside stds are a thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that will literally never happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,alright then they can come up with the way for it not to clear from blood fast it cant be that hard to add some marker thats a medical ethics and medical liability problem in the case of prescribing bcps the woman is the patient adding unnecessary things to her medications that are designed to hang round in her blood for weeks is altering her treatment regime exposing her to more possible side effects and allergic reactions to please someone who is not the patient this is a problem and even if you did this if the marker hangs round in her blood for weeks and weeks which it would have to she could do things like take a large dose and then stop taking the pill shed ovulate after a few weeks and a test would still show shed had the substance in her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if all forms of lying is illegal then everyone will be in jail because im sure that both men and women have lied about something in order to get laid many men lie about their jobs and income and many women lie about how many partners theyve had
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if youre upset about how much youre taxed direct your rage at medicare or government pensions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,huh interesting i cant tell a difference my bf definitely can though im allergic to latex and have never used latex condoms so maybe thats why the polyisoprene ones are supposedly more natural feeling
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im talking about a oneoff event using withdrawal even imperfectly and especially in conjunction with birth control even imperfectly leaves a low percentage chance of pregnancy those failure rates are calculated over the length of a year thats pretty good odds for a single encounter few accidental pregnancies occur from genuine contraceptive failure more often in the heat of the moment one or both parties in various states of sobriety doesnt bother and no surely all dont do that research but the information is instantly available to them in a way that it wasnt for their parents and grandparents who also had sex never before in human history have we been able to control reproduction as much as we can today if laziness is your excuse for not knowing your options you have bigger problems than a potential pregnancy the only std that its a crime to lie about is hivaids lying about say herpes isnt criminal but you could try to sue that person in civil court my question to you is how do you think people who do not know this should be treated i personally think sex education should be thorough and abortion should be widely accessible for such accidents but the us at least seems to be moving in the opposite direction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,both genders catch shit if they are not married in their and do not have kids it is just crappy like that for everyone in that situation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok then i agree that we should expand funding for social programs for men what kind of programs do you think would be beneficial and i also agree that we should work to lessen the gender pay gap
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women can buy condoms and aca covers them for them but not men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dudes should think about this very happily actually takes pressure off their back why support a woman that is way past her prime or has kids from another man just live your life guys emancipation proclamation of mgtowtrp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the patriarchy forbid the majority of women from working outside the home making them dependent upon men for their livelihoods this made even low smv guys suddenly appealing as marriage prospects with the ability to earn their own money women choose a husband based upon other factors than economic ones this affects those low smv guys since now their low smv is not propped up by their ability to provide financial resources
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women do not exactly have that attitude since many of them succeeded in spite of the considerable obstacles thrown in their path the uks pm is a woman so is the scottish first minister and here there are women in plenty of top positions however yes women will fight to take away the unfair and completely undeserved advantage men have in the workplace
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but a sexual welfare state is okay with you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you mean his staff engineered this election beautifully without daddys loan he would be just a redneck drinking beer in a bar and groping waitresses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok in this example of yours if it were to be instituted how precisely would you propose we punish men who cheat on their wives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly if being an executive made someone that miserable then yeah i would say they need to change their situation money and power be damned money and power dont make up for a lack of joy in life just like how in oppressive marriages security and comfort dont make up for the ability to choose your own future and fulfill your ambitions as a human being
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hello there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,let the unattractive be hung out to dry let nature take its course just dont shit on us too much for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont act like i am an apologist for the nanny state im not that is a whole other conversation i accept that that mans suffering is not reason to deprive another person of their agency i cant force someone to fuck that guy then we are done not much else to say
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,marital rape was a common thing in the past thats probably what he was talking about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you didnt do your due diligence or werent given the appropriate information to properly do that due diligence i agree its all about buyer beware but at the same time if the market becomes this embattled i dont think many people will find it appealing and if indeed you are of the opinion that it is always buyer beware then you must agree that a womans history including sexual is pertinent to that decision and should be fully discussed yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have no idea why you wouldnt pull out if you arent using condoms either im pointing out that its hypocrite that a man is punished when he was the victim to start with and yeah it should be an excuse
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes and therefore no one will ever believe feminists are for equality or fairness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no you can add something that has no side effect maybe assume thats possible then nothing should be wrong about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when they lied it wasnt illegal so they didnt do anything illegal so why would everyone be in jail if you make it illegal and people can prove others lied yes they should be punished not necessarily jail can just make them pay a good amount of money either way its unfair to say that a man should be punished when in fact hes a victim of lying what exactly do you punish him for and why do you reward a woman for that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i totally do they need to go as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i couldnt even tell you what kinds we used all i can say is that i wasnt a fan but then again we first tried them months into our sex life which was the first sex life for either of us so theres a chance it would have become normal feeling if wed kept it up but there wasnt a reason to so we didnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i really cant tell the difference either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only std that its a crime to lie about is hivaids lying about say herpes isnt criminal but you could try to sue that person in civil court i dont think this is true for all states from httpswwwstdcheckcomblogstdsandthelaw californias law as in other states like florida makes it a misdemeanor resulting in a few months in jail a fine or both if the std is something other than hivaids it is a felony if the disease in question is aids re pulling out i agree that the chances for pregnancy in a single encounter are low but when you multiply by millions of encounters low rates produce nonnegligible numbers and it seems like your stance is still tough luck for the guy if the girl wants to keep it and again many people think its foolproof if they are an average couple and do this for say four years the chance of pregnancy becomes which is this is really not that low theres other stuff i could respond to but i dont totally disagree and that would just be another tome so ill skip it re the other stuff first to take a step back i want to say that i am actually a big believer in personal responsibility in real life im sure i wouldnt necessarily have that much sympathy for a lot of guys to which this happens i am personally much more careful in my own life but i am objecting here because there is a real sense that people like pinning this stuff on some ignorant some careless guys because they can this also ties into my response to your other question which i think is a very good one namely well what do you think should happen well as you can tell i think education should be improved not just basic physical facts but more cynical realworld stuff daterape avoidance for girls and educating guys on just how little power they have over their sperm once its out of their body and teaching both guys and girls that there are people out there who would exploit them but education will never be near perfect and this will still happen what then well to be honest it gets tricky im well aware that this is a very complicated situation a solution that would satisfy me would involve some kind of omniscient wholly fair arbiter so yea back to the drawing board i realize that most measures put in place that would help a guy in this situation could also probably be twisted to hurt some girls who honestly need the support maybe they were promised by the fathers that theyd contribute so frankly i dont have a solution that im confident would be better but if people said yea its a system with a lot of problems but theyre hard to work out some guys will get screwed over and thats not fair but its the most workable system we have now id very much see where they were coming from but what annoys me is that people act like there is not even a problem thats where the whole you had sex with her you knew the risks now pay up attitude rubs me the wrong way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,true agreed still id say that theres more tolerance for a bachelor male in that situation thats had romantic or sexual experience and chooses not to get married than for a year old male virgin women dont get as much shit for having absolutely no relationship experience as men and their status as decent human beings isnt questioned the same way still it sucks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no honestly im leaning far more towards the rugged individualist compromise you want a ruggedly individualist sexual marketplace and that seems to be the most ethical one even if i feel very badly for people who have a hard time there its wrong to force people into something they dont want to do but likewise im not sold in the leftist paradigm that there arent enough jobs and that poverty is always because of the system no theres definitely some people in poverty because they made stupid decisions and thats okay poverty sucks its a strong disincentive to making stupid decisions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that doesnt do any good if her partner refuses to wear them thats what im saying he needs to wear a condom they both need to be responsible for having safe sex because if they get pregnant they are both responsible for the kid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah like why are they so angry and bothered
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the patriarchy forbid the majority of women from working outside the home which law in which country in which time period are you referring to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women do not exactly have that attitude women will fight to take away the unfair and completely undeserved advantage men have in the workplace ok than
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would love to see most people flip a million or two million dollar loan into a billion dollar business i dont think you understand how improbable that is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you could say that about most there are many who lose all of their wealth within a generation or two he grew up in the business world and not the political arena he never started with the façade of a champion of the people whether it is sincere or not hardly even matters politicians care about public image business men care about results as an average person which do you think i care about more
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not op but bring back fault based divorce and rake him over the coals in court
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id say it wouldnt be much different than today theyre on the hook for child support and alimony and failure to pay would result in incarceration unlike today it should at least be based on the husbands income but thats what id say nofault divorce should definitely be shitcanned
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the same way as women who cheat on their husbands whether it be public disapproval money or stoning to death
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im all for that if we include the unproductive into that as well the socialists would never go for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i accept that that mans suffering is not reason to deprive another person of their agency i cant force someone to fuck that guy then we are done not much else to say what about labor is it acceptable to force someone to labor for another
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im confused im talking about a sexual event that leads to pregnancy are you talking about marriage because you are free to have whatever standards you want for a partner
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes not a victim he willingly had sex and didnt protect himself from what he knows to be the biological consequences of sex if he was forced into it then yes hes a victim
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh thats just obvious but its not because of that i dont really think thats fair if you helped make a kid you helped make a kid theres certainly better ways to handle it and lying about birth control should be punished if it can be proven lol good luck but what are you gonna do leave the kid out to dry pass the cost onto the rest of society aka other taxpaying men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,assume thats possible we dont know it is possible and to work out whether it is possible would cost hundreds of millions and create a tool for invasion of everyones privacy in situations very different to the one that prompted the development of the tool
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women as a whole pay of taxes and use of the funds you fucking greedy bitches do you have a source for these numbers im dubious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what the hell dude why are you being so personal about this fsb isnt going to start calling you an ugly virgin most of the women on this sub already fall into the has a good job makes more money and pays more taxes camp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,single parent support systems are a drop in the bucket by comparison you wouldnt notice a difference if they were cut out entirely most of your money that goes to welfare ends up paying for the elderly and sick and disabled poor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i mean im all for the fact that there are consequences to peoples actions and all for selfreliance the part that i have a hard time with is children children didnt ask to be born into poverty and it wasnt their own choices that led them there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if her partner refuses then she needs to dump them if she assents then its on her if he doesnt change his mind and she doesnt change his mind then its rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theyre angry because they are being pushed by feminists into having to marry or ltr these women despite it being against their best interests
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i see so the patriarchy never happened women have always had equal rights
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,please read back through history it is common knowledge that the vast majority of women were not in a place to earn a decent living by themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,quite a different attitude from getting drunk in a corner right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,an unregulated smp personal freedom i support freedom pretty easy to understand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,stoning to death who raised you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no just end all welfare and social security go to universal basic income social welfare for the unattractive would be cooling it on the stigma that men often get after a certain age without any romantic experience at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you want to have that conversation go to rpolitics or reconomics it doesnt really fit in ppd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well back in the day one led directly to the next so but fair enough i do see your point on that front doesnt change the fact that a woman willing to lie about bc is willing to lie about other things as well personally i prefer not to stick my willy in anyone im not willing to raise a child with full stop
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he was lied to he had sex willingly only because he was lead to believe she got the bc covered its basically rape by deception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no pass it on whoevers fault it is in this case whoever lied about bc if a man lies that hes on bc you can be sure hell be paying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we know that lying about such things should be punished at least we need to admit that and then in principle if theres a way to track something it should be done thats a whole different topic though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what the hell dude why are you being so personal about this seriously this has always been the atmosphere at ppd say something even slightly red bitter loser say something even slightly blue greedy bitches
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually they arent a drop in the bucket medicaid is mostly populated by single moms which is a huge line item budget issue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not about particular programs men outearn women on average and have more combined assets any attempt at wealth redistribution from wealthy to poor is money transfer from men to women as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youre basically just saying its her fault no matter what and thats just not accurate why is it completely up to the woman and her alone to have safe sex its up to both partners are men not as smart as women do they not understand how babies are made should men not be helped responsible for having unsafe sex as well or do men not have agency over their actions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how are they pushing it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uh no feminists dont push men to marry at all men marry because they are lonely fall in love or want a consistent partner to fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my common knowledge tells me that most people were not in that position
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mother father and uncle ahmed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,others dont seem to mind in fact that question is central to this particular thread op directly mentions it and thus far the moderators of ppd have allowed it so im not really seeing the issue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a woman whos willing to lie about bc is a woman you should have absolutely nothing to do with sexual or otherwise huge red flag once youre in a relationship with someone and youve established boundaries by all means you ought to trust her enough to put your guard down and have unprotected sex but if youre taking someone home from the bar treat that gun like its loaded and just riddled with stds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,treat that gun like its loaded preaching to the choir with me but perhaps some of the parishioners are paying attention
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,based on the amount of bragging i hear about not using condoms i kinda doubt it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that they try to make it work even if they dont feel love or attraction anymore everything else is up to them because the rules for how a marriage should look arent as strict anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it should bind people to not run at the first sign of trouble people nowadays are like urgh my spouse sat on my side of the sofa i want a divooorce then the kids world is turned upside down but hey birthdays right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe the same commitment as a society a willingness to listen and to support and to compromise
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you mean legally or morally speaking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to not have to conduct their marriage according to the opinions of strangers or have strangers decide ifwhen that marriage should end that is all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to help and support each other emotionally mentally and physically ie help each other selfactualize to their highest potential
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,modern marriage de facto does not bind most woman to most man there is evidence of this in the uncommon circumstance that a woman marries down she is at risk of having her financial resources taken via alimony most women easily avoid this risk by marrying up stopping work having kids etc in net this does not impose a chilling effect on the vast majority of women hence women file for divorce the rate of men the vast majority of men on the other hand are bound to the marriage contract by threat of injury to finances and relationships with their kids men suffer disproportionately in the legal system compared to women thier options thus chilled men are inclined to stick it out again men file for divorce at a rate of women all of this means the average man in todays average marriage is bound to the contract but the average woman is not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can you clarify what it is youre asking please
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes that you are committed to raise a family through sickness and health richerpoorer etc not as a strategy to lock in of his resources plus ongoing income while she finds another baby daddy currently divorce is almost incentivised with the female getting the benefits staying married and having a stable family is nearly the minority after a recent spat with my daughter she informed me that she will move out and live with her mum and dad when she gets them because i never let her do what she wants
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whatever they want to promise to one another the traditional idea of marriage is all but dead really
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can you expand on this question what exactly are you asking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nothing marriage is outdated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think that if the woman has given birth to the mans children he should be obligated to provide for her and the children in order to compensate for her agony in childbearing but not vice versa unless she wants to edit of course she should have to provide for the children but not necessarily the man unless absolutely necessary
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dat hyperbole tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not a bad answer actually
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sooo rabbi shammai and rabbi hillel fighting down the ages
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the thing is our society is exposed to so many people with such a varying degree of interests and passions that theres this perpetual grass is greener feeling like years ago it was a lot harder to just up and move to x city for a job there werent thousands of genres of music cultures were more segmented this is not a bad thing in my opinion but i think it has affected people because they want to find someone who is perfect for their thousands of preferences and lets face it since the baby boomers weve had a sense of entitlement so many people feel entitled to things but it just doesnt work that way an amalgamation of these things and others are what produces this lack of work ethic in general but more specifically towards relationships
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,either one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure what you mean what is confusing you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes that you are committed to raise a family through sickness and health richerpoorer etc eh not necessarily anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eh i would imagine weddings have always been commercialized just like holidays have always been commercialized i mean the commercialization of christmas predates christianity itself going all the way back to when dec was a pagan holiday both wedding holiday celebrations have become more lavish but thats just because people are making more money now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i approve of talmudic references
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you forgot social media which allows women access to large quantities of men that women would not have had access to in the past
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,true you just divorce the guy and the state forces him to keep providing as i mentioned divorce has been incentivised and divorce rape is a legal strategy women can use to ensure resources for their children
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which allows women access to large quantities of men that women would not have had access to in the past and men or are you implying that women are solely to blame for marriages going to shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the partner who makes the most money pays alimony yes thats not always the man it just happens men have often made more money than women the tides have changed a bit and there have been quite a few stories about famous women paying alimony this is an area i actually feel similarly to rp i think alimony in general is stupid outside of certain cases like housewives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of divorces filed by women as men predominantly would be a better word than solely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and im waiting for enough of those rich women to get totally screwed in court before we see the laws start changing or perhaps when more samesex marriages end up in divorce court and the judge has to determine which women should be screwed over worse itll change either way it should be an interesting show
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,claiming more women file for divorce than men goes against your point more than anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its like men are bad partners or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youre implying that if a woman files for divorce its because she fucked up the relationship
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats what i always think when this is brought up whos more likely to file the paperwork the cheater or the cheatedon the abused or the abuser the one who goes out for cigarettes and never comes back or the one left behind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the implication being women are horrible at choosing partners
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who is more likely to be raped the drunk scantily clad girl or the sober modest girl dont women call this victim blaming when its done women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,looking at samesex couples women divorce httpsenwikipediaorgwikidivorceofsamesexcouples as men so factoring out men lays more claim to which sex is the problem additionally in malefemale couples women are much more incentivized to divorce because the family court system is so skewed in their favor its also women that that are the ones that balk at the idea of signing a prenup
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or there arent enough good ones to go around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure because wearing a skimpy outfit is just as bad as cheating on or abusing or abandoning your spouse this analogy makes no sense anyway i said nothing about victimhood or whether the man deserved the divorce or anything of the sort im just saying it doesnt make sense to assume that the person who actually files the paperwork is always the source of the problems in the marriage lets switch the genders so maybe youll get my point wife cheats on husband empties his bank account and skips town husband files for divorce do you honestly think the husband is the one who destroyed the marriage in this situation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you need a refresher on analogies a is to b as c is to d im not saying a c as you seem to think this is the crux of the discussion man is victim assumption is its mans fault woman is victim you had better not imply its somehow her fault get it it requires quite the mental gymnastics to arrive at your conclusion that instead of divorce rate of women demonstrating how fickle women are the divorce rate shows how crappy men are serious mental gymnastics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not assuming anything my point is essentially that who files for divorce tells you nothing about the reasons the divorce was filed might be the mans fault might be the womans fault might be the dogs fault who the fuck knows i can just as easily say its the fault of shitty men as you can say its the fault of shitty women at the end of the day were both using flimsy evidence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fact that women file more often than men may imply that women give up sooner andor more often than men though i think that is at least the implication being made since women file for divorce more often they are also the ones more often likely to give up first i cant say if thats true or not but it does make some sense to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but my point is its one of many equally feasible imo conclusions to jump to i just dont think that fact alone isolated from any further information is evidence of much of anything at all in my admittedly limited experience men dont like to be the ones to officially end the relationship even in a mutual breakup they want you to be the one to actually say the words its over ive even had a couple male friends tell me that if they dont want to be in a relationship anymore theyll start to distance themselves and act like assholes until she eventually dumps him so its not surprising to me that regardless of the events that led up to the divorce and for the record with most divorces i think both parties carry the blame the woman would be the one who actually goes to the courthouse and files the paperwork first i just dont think that proves anything and like i said in another comment i have a hard time believing that if the stat were the other way around and men filed more often rpers would take that as evidence that men are fickle and quicker to destroy relationships i believe they would say see women are so impossible to live with they leave men no choice but to divorce its just a perfect example of a fact that can be bent to suit either sides narrative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you are correct that many men dont want to be the bad guy and say its over however having been through a divorce ill admit my primary reasons for holding out way beyond hope were twofold i was concerned about financial ruin i didnt want to lose access to my children so yeah at the time i dealt with a very crappy situation because i feared losing my children and going broke plus to be honest i married the first time still being somewhat religious and even married in a real church so there was also a bit of stubbornness with me not wanting for break my word in the end i didnt get to make the choice because my ex made if for us both but that kinda does at least in my case imply she gave up first i was willing and able to try and in fact was going toward fixing things i was just putting all my effort into the wrong things i even agreed to couples counselling which ive never had much belief in not because i think counselling is bs but because there isnt a single couple i know that was saved through couples counselling in all cases including my own it made things worse
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,however having been through a divorce ill admit my primary reasons for holding out way beyond hope were twofold i was concerned about financial ruin i didnt want to lose access to my children quite understandable but im talking even about nonmarriage relationships where there are no kids and far less at stake i dont doubt situations like yours happen though and they are probably quite common im not trying to push a men are always at fault narrative and i think the fact that men generally have more to lose in a divorce does complicate things and gives them less incentive to file i just also dont think its fair to assume that a woman filing for divorce means its necessarily her fault the marriage is over except in the most technical sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just also dont think its fair to assume that a woman filing for divorce means its necessarily her fault the marriage is over except in the most technical sense as much as i agree with you short of talking to many divorced women and assuming they tell the truth well really never know all we can do is look at the data and admit women file more often and to men considering marriage that bit of data is rather troubling no matter what the cause ive known marriages that ended because the husband cheated and the wife filed but i know plenty where the marriage just sucked and the wife checked out first more of the latter than the former in my case but my social circle is admittedly small
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well really never know this is basically all im getting at im admittedly young and havent had much experience with divorce besides relatives and parents of friends growing up and as a kid you dont really have any insight into what went on in those marriages my social circle is just starting to get married although i did have a friend get divorced earlier this year after years of marriage because her husband cheated and gave her an std so i dont claim to be any sort of expert on the matter especially when speaking to someone whos actually lived it years from now my view may be totally different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im rather old school so to me there are very few justified reasons for a divorce now that statement is kinda loaded because many people seem to be of the opinion that happiness is the ultimate goal in life and i differ from that opinion to me happiness is what comes from living a good life however you define good and that actually trying to work to be happy is pointless people that put happiness at the top of their list are also the ones most likely to bail when things go south and in any ltr things will go south which is to say they give up because its difficult to fix the relationship and far easier to throw your hands up and declare it a failure in my mind if you are that type of person marriage probably isnt for you unfortunately getting married often makes people happy so i suspect those folks go ahead at the time because it feels good not really thinking about how theyll react when it no longer feels good and instead sucks and requires effort cheating sucks no matter how you slice it its an immediate deal breaker for me so i completely understand others that feel the same and in my opinion one of the few legitimate reasons to divorce i mean if they promised to be faithful and cheated they already broke the relationship the divorce is just making it official at that point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you and i are in total agreement on all of this im pretty oldfashioned when it comes to marriage and divorce myself i think marriage is forever and plan to go into it with that mindset ive always believed the grass is greener where you water it and that living your life as a search for happiness whatever that is is an exercise in futility happiness does not exist as a permanent state of being its a ridiculous thing to strive for in my opinion growing up my parents had a terrible marriage i mean screaming fights every single day my dad left more than once they both did and said terrible things to one another it was a terrible environment to grow up in and i often thought everyone would have been happier in the long run if they just split up but they didnt because theyre old fashioned and because their church taught that divorce is one of the worst sins you can commit this past weekend they celebrated their anniversary and as bad as things used to be theyve seemed really happy together for the past years or so they also havent had any kids in the house for the past years which probably has something to do with it ha theyre an example to me that as rough as a marriage can get you can get through it and still be on the same team in the end if youre determined to stay together but of course both people have to have that mindset not much you can do if one person decides to give up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if she fucks lots of guys
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think overt friendliness to men they barely know is a huge tell those big broad smiles genuine sounding personal questions towards the man touchyfeely kino etc every woman must have learnt when she was about what this kind of social approach does to the man it also has the plausible deniability of i was just being friendly or im like that towards everyone to excuse the slutty intentions of behaving like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,slut tells are usually the sum of a lot of little details about a persons personality their openness on sexuality drugs family and friends will tell you a lot impulsive behavior is one i see commonly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this isnt the first time weve had this discussion you and i theres and signs of slut goodness excerpts ones i particularly agree with has tattoos piercings outside of earlobe cusses a lot in particular uses the word fuck frequently in all its forms and parts of speech refers to fucking and female genitalia as pussy or cunt and male genitalia as cock extra body hair and deep speaking voice indicates high t her friends are sluts bad relationship with father andor has divorced parents prefers domestic beer or hard liquor to other forms of alcohol when out with friends does a lot of tequila shots talks frequently about sexual double standards says things like its a mans world and not fair that guys who fuck lots of girls are studs but girls who fuck lots of guys are sluts smokes cigarettes has lots of male friends or gay male friends is a single mother nota bene the existence of slut tells does not mean a particular woman is a slut the absence of slut tells does not mean a particular woman is not a slut these are indicative and predictive only these tells only show tendencies and likelihoods not certainty the more slut tells means its more likely shes a slut the fewer its more likely shes not a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,attention seeking behavior attention seeking dress style attention seeking social media use has a poor opinion of men in general substance use drugs binge drinking alcohol smoking vulgarity all things any reasonable man should screen for regardless of slut status edit posts minion memes on facebook

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,brags about previous sexual exploits
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought they have the so called thousandcock stare i see trpers bring this up a lot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,liberals opinionated nosy women quiet women who put a lot of effort into their looks sluts are all around us they can blend in well virgins on the other hand are much more difficult to point out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are no absolutes and slut tells heavily overlap with attention whoretease that being said tells you about some deep personal trauma within minutes of meeting you has tons of guy friends especially when her social circle has high turnover doesnt get along with other girls especially if she openly states this cleverly dodges questions about her relationship status especially with specific guys there has been public physical contact with that looks romantic ish posts sexually provocative pics on social media these do not have to be incredibly revealing but sometimes just have subtle undertones like a bit of cleavage with a provocative expression the ultimate tell is that if you sleep with her very early on this is almost certainly not the first time this has happened especially if she says im not usually like this lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wearing high heels and very short skirts during normal everyday activities like going to the library or the grocery store this is even more so if its very cold outside
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dating after
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,any woman can be a slut under the right conditions just like how any dog can kill a rabbit its instinctual some ride the cc others dont but it would be a mistake to assume that she cant be a slut and retain a moderately low ncount the big one for me is how often she gets drunk ive noticed a trend that women who drink frequently have sleazy predilections
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,biggest tells are excess tattoos unnatural colored hair excessive attention seeking not valuing sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,has one night stands with people theyve met that night i also believe this behaviour is slutty regardless of gender since fuck knows what youre screwing and how it could eventually impact you indicative of risky behaviour in other areas too do it if you want since its your life but theres no way i would engage with it

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that really depends i know some girls who hang off my arm and i know is a slut but if youve been friends with a long time i am sure this one girl whos touchy feeling has only slept with guys girls who dont touch you at all are not interested though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive fucked less than people but im incredibly open about sex it just doesnt register with me to be ashamed about something thats natural and everyone does or wants ive certainly done drugs but that hasnt affected the number of partners ive had aaand my family definitely has issues with fidelity and sex check check and check

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly they cant shut up about it they basically act like a dude and brag it will often be under the pretense that a guy should know her sexual history because its the right thing to talk about and youre insecure for having visceral disgust upon hearing shit you dont want to hear about and its never just the number gory details always come up i mean what impression does a slut want me to have of her yeah its a shit test but dont act like a guy is trying to make you feel bad for acting low value

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,other slut tells according to the rok article sourced in the comments are wearing hoop earrings growing up with multiple brothers and being an athlete also being a little overweight and having attended a catholic school so dont be fat but dont be athletic either and religion is apperently bad for moral development
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a purple flair next to their name this goes for mansluts and womensluts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am super creeped out by the person who said a slut tell is when a woman dated a black guy i though we agreed racial stuff even when implied was not cool
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jesus h christ the way people are being deliberately obtuse whenever this is talked about is fucking maddening its about tendencies people goddamn some of you are so fucking obtuse its just silly lets illustrate this girl works as a nurse shes been dating a guy for a couple of months she has a tattoo she works nights she drinks ipas and occasionally mich ultra this woman is probably not a slut girl works as a bartender shes also been dating a guy a couple of months she smokes cigarettes and has a tramp stamp her three best friends are men and she often drinks jim beam rocks with three other guys she works with after work her parents are divorced and she is divorced after a very brief failed first marriage this woman probably is a slut is it possible girl is a slut and girl is not sure it is however much more likely that girl is not a slut and girl is yall got it now christ
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,note to various people reading this out of context and saying hurr durr i have a tattoo and drink beer and im not a slut hurr durr its about taking all of the persons traits into account its about the likelihood that a woman is a slut or not slut tells are predictive and indicative they show tendencies and likelihoods you dont say she has of these shes a slut or she has two of these shes not a slut you look at all the facts and circumstances together
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont racebait
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sluts are all around us they can blend in well damn sounds like a slutspiracy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how on earth can these women dont feel cold at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,considering the way things are going for me right now i guess ill be the first virgin slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fine line between wizard and slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,interesting by your definition i am not a slut i like it have all my upvotes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,any woman can be a slut under the right conditions just like how any dog can kill a rabbit its instinctual exactly how often she gets drunk is indeed a great measure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what do you mean by unnatural colored hair tasteful highlights are okay but the blue and pink haired crowd are raging sluts all hair color is unnatural when you say not valuing sex does that mean has too much sex or does not have it enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my nerdy sister and many of her nerdy friends have bright colored hair yet somehow i dont think theyre getting any 😂
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,has one night stands with people theyve met that night i wait for the second night to have ons and for the third one to have anal therefore im not a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill never be a slut 😢
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shhh i believe you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what their relationships is like with their family will clue you in to a lot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eyeroll
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pretty much sluts drink bud busch and miller lite budlight miller and mich cheap horse piss domestics sometimes blue moon or sam adams or stella nonsluts drink ipas or craft beers goose island redds ales hard ciders shit like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not a red flag for slut its a red flag for brain damaged
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i once saw a reddit post where some girl had a shitty tattoo from ass to neck as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly they cant shut up about it they basically act like a dude and brag oh how terrible a woman acting like a man what is this world coming to 🙄
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do you think this is the case i think people who brag about their sexual experience in gory detail often only have a few partners and are eager to seem sexually mature overcompensating for inexperience basically i noticed this as a trend among my friends post losing their virginity sex was a huge deal for a while the big thing and everyone wanted to pretend that they got it and were good in the bedroom no one talked about it in detail after that same with drinking people only like to talk about getting wasted when theyre new to getting wasted nobodys talking about tactical vomiting and boasting abt their suppressed gag reflex in my life anymore and for that i am glad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some women have a dude brain so they behave like dudes not their fault so many straight dudes are complete hypocrites about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they can pry my whiskey from my cold dead apparently slutty hands
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have a couple of tattoos and my parents divorced i wonder if my lack of piercings and the fact that i do not go around randomly shouting pussy or cock balance it out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love how things like that are totally out of ones control like having brothers and having big boobs are slut tells
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how dare you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i though we agreed racial stuff even when implied was not cool im ok with people saying stuff like this it makes the fucking idiots that much easier to spot its also genuinely funny really fucking a black dude slut likewhy does black dick white dicks or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,these are always going to be ridiculed because in so many circles theyre not realistic and the actually promiscuous women there fly completely under the radar because so many slut tells are really just things that a guy happens to find unattractive and decides to classify as a tell on top of that if these observations are reserved for places like clubs and bars or just common places you to go meet women then obviously its going to be nonsense when applied to women as a whole because thats just a small fraction of women that you were looking at when you developed your tells if you dont want to deal with the jokes though you dont have to join in on the discussion most of us know what we can expect from a thread like this and surely so do you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the reason we are commenting under the auto mod is so we can poke fun at it without subverting commenting rules this is the place to make jokes what we are doing is entirely appropriate auto mod is for ridicule either you believe this stuff that you posted or you dont
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a legit slut tell though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how can our sluts be real if our social constructs arent real
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im only
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,desire for attractive male attention overrides comfort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont really lose heat through your legs short skirt does not cold nor do high heels depending on type
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,male attention is all they need to keep warm i remember this year old chick in the middle of winter wearing nothing but a tshirt and shorts so short it was more ass than shorts and no leggings she must be used to the cold hell maybe she was raised by santa claus
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh youre not the first i was a virgin slut back in the day haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how can a virgin be a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what do you mean by unnatural colored hair tasteful highlights are okay but the blue and pink haired crowd are raging sluts all hair color is unnatural natural as in black brunette blonde redhead colors that naturally exist on people of their ethnicity bright blue purple pink are usually slut tells alt or emo or rebellious style in general typically especially if its not just highlights highlights are more ambiguous especially if shes past and even more if the highlights are not bright and more subtle its basically attention seeking when you say not valuing sex does that mean has too much sex or does not have it enough sex is just an activity like playing basketball that you do with your friends
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have an upvote its all i can do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because you dont try
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how so divorced parents slut or bad relationship with her father slut that just seems so strange to me plenty of women with good relationships with their parents were raised in a sexpositive way and sleep around so unless im missing what you were actually trying to say i dont see it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so any woman who drinks hard liquor is a slut or just if they drink the cheap stuff
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nonsluts dont drink beer in general typically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when i do drink i drink natty light natty ice walgreens big flats old milwaukee and pbr never crazy horse or old english i abhor their foul tang crazy horse is only for horses not humans
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same thing amirite but yeah more like a red flag for middle aged mother lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,minions are the shit tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can almost hear the trigger pull
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nothing innately terrible about it but if shes a straight woman trying to attract a straight man she should realize that that behavior is going to turn men away from her no matter how unfair it seems
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well if it can be said theres the nice guy syndrome the cool girl suffers a mirroring effect shes not one of the guys but shell act it and its not just the conversation and details its the resulting shift in actions that go against the sexually mature image they are portraying the prudish behavior isnt far behind its easily fixed but most people dont want to be honest enough to change their actions desire is not as flexible as a façade
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not their fault never is is it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah the ol men and women should be the same aroo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so women can do and say whatever they want and men must worship them and never judge them sounds fair by your logic a woman with a history of stealing just has a thiefs brain so we need to just accept that and not judge
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,many of these tells seem to be more the product of a nerdy screenwriters imagination than reality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think i have some whiskey in the freezer and now im kind of wanting a glass even edit i do how exciting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have tattoos piercings drink dont have a close relationship with my family curse post on social media dye my hair have lots of guy friends wear summer clothing in winter have friendly chats with people who are sometimes men have a count more than have dated more than one man have fooled around in taboo areas but maybe my catowning netflixloving homebodyness will balance it somehow only time will tell whether or not thats enough to save me from the slut hell im destined for edit i wonder if it matters that some of my tattoos are paintings or animerelated a few points for the nonslut side probably not but a girl can dream
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know i guess women should lie and say they dont have brothers actually most women i know who had a bunch of brothers had difficulty doing any dating when they were teensearly because the brothers tended to get intrusive and why are rok people so angry about big boobs that is just flat out weird as hell
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,does it make her a slut even if shes black
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a brown guy that has dated a few white chicks it basically boils down to white guys thinking youre stealing their women and that because you are of an inferior race she has no standards if shes sleeping with you i actually found a different corollary when i was with these girls in that i was treated with extra respect because i must have had something going for me to land the prized white girl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for some personal reason it always makes my skin crawl it might be something i am overly sensitive about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive found these to be quite realistic no matter what circles you run in in some circles all the girls are sluts theyre not reserved for bars and clubs theyre for anywhere and everywhere you go i didnt develop these tells its not looking at a small fraction of women these were developed by hundreds on thousands of men from all walks of life every region of the country and every age and station
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think hes saying its inappropriate to ridicule i think hes saying the ridicule doesnt land because its making fun of ideas that people dont actually believe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol its a rhetorical question but yeah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i live in an environment thats regularly somewhere below c in the winter its very common here to see women with skimpy dresses and no jacket a very decent chunk of the us gets very cold never seems to stop drunk hoes from prancing around though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont really lose heat through your legs um thats not how thermoregulation works you lose heat through any exposed skin surface that said you lose heat more rapidly through exposed skin with bloodflow nearer the surface papers have been published about this for almost years
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont you live in australia you dont get to talk about cold mmkay a jelly canadian
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,😂
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxecurlnxcqk
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im just following darklords definition
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you delay it until your a wizard if you delay until your a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,colors that naturally exist on people of their ethnicity hmmmm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,back to my original post sum of its parts kind of like how you figure out anything about someone you observe witness all the shit they say and do see who they associate themselves with and what their background is and then youll be able to insinuate a lot more about them there is no automatic sluttell unless they explicitly tell you just indicators that youre getting involved with someone potentially dicey
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,divorced parents more likely to be a slut bad relationship with father more likely to be a slut you read all the facts and circumstances together theres more to it than just one or two aspects of the womans personality and background
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,divorced parents slut seems theres a trend in that favor i just ran the numbers using the cdc nsfg data set for partner count vs parental situation at age for interviewee living with both biological parents living with biological parent not living with either biological parent partner count results median mean living with both biological parents together living with biological parent not living with biological parents
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lone star wasnt on the list so i dodged a bullet somewhat huzzah sometimes youre broke and you still want a beer and really i dont dislike it anyway i feel like hard ciders and redds are on the same level as the domestics listed theyre always grouped together at the places i go iirc but i might also think that since i dont like cider haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also apparently only tequila shots are slutty whiskey shots or vodka shots are okay then i guess phew i know for me tequila shots are actually a great way to stay chaste i wont have time to have sex with anybody ill be too busy puking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sigh nota bene the existence of slut tells does not mean a particular woman is a slut the absence of slut tells does not mean a particular woman is not a slut these are indicative and predictive only these tells only show tendencies and likelihoods not certainty the more slut tells means its more likely shes a slut the fewer its more likely shes not a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so even if they drink the over priced beer in hipster micro brew pubs they are sluts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats even worse
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no wonder i couldnt attract girls in college i was horse not man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,psh why do you think shes a mom if shes​ never had sex trp confirmed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,found the slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not the one who is bothered by masculine women here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i feel like i have heard a gender flipped version of what you just said somewhere else hmm masculine women and femboys of the world unite
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well my point still stands is this girl really a slut or is she just trying to seem cool within her peer group by peacocking abt her knowledge of the new cool thing is this a slut tell or is it just a thing you dont like men dont really talk about sexual exploits in gory detail with each other either women are a lot more explicit with their bffs about sexual encounters though esp after the age of or so and i feel like before that a lot of them are exaggerating or embellishing shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well thats your fault isnt it learn to complain better p
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he said some women have dude brains hes not talking about men and women generally
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah the ol nuance offends me so ill flush it all down the loo but do tell me why all women should be treated in just one way and all men another start with ewwwww sperm are gross and take me through your logical thought processes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,enjoy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,animerelated fake geek girl definite slut tell
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,an attention seeking homebody so like you have a developed extroverted and introverted side do you know your mbti type do you consider yourself to be promiscuous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good question perhaps one of the red pill scientists here will answer it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive found these to be quite realistic no matter what circles you run in in some circles all the girls are sluts theyre not reserved for bars and clubs theyre for anywhere and everywhere you go i didnt develop these tells its not looking at a small fraction of women these were developed by hundreds on thousands of men from all walks of life every region of the country and every age and station nah i mean theres just nothing else to say to this but i tried at least carry on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair enough i definitely think the exhaustive rok list is complete bullshit that is just one opinion of course
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well yeah if youre not wearing a jacket youll be cold but there is v little difference between wearing a miniskirt and having your legs covered even when its very cold esp if youre wearing stockings which entrap heat better than heavier fabrics like denim also there are drunk hoes at your grocery store how strange
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wasnt implying that it doesnt happen at all obviously just that it happens at a much slower rate and is not likely to make you cold if i get my boobs out on a freezing street ill be super cold in a minute or two my legs itll be a lot longer before i get uncomfortable short skirt stockings jacket knit shirt or top with sweater scarf not cold thanks for the paper from tho lol i wish youd found something from ive heard thats when papers were mostly likely to be accurate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well tbh you guys are idiots for going outside in your winter its fucking degrees celsius stay the fuck at home the club will wait for summer you know at that point who is anyone to judge because youre all fools ive gone out in degree ish weather tho and i maintain that a short skirt and sheer stockings is generally warmer than jeans
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hahahaha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpyoutubexecurlnxcqk thats the joke in comedy views since apr ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i didnt see his definition
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a blonde black person looks unnatural for example
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think women lie about this as much as trp assumes so i wouldnt put this amount of thought into it and i wouldnt say dicey but yeah fair enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the sins of the father arent we as a society past this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i guess i was thinking of slut tells as signs shes almost definitely a slut rather than things that means shes more likely than the average woman to be a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha lone star is my goto as well i like some hard ciders but i agree that theyd be grouped in with domestics for the most part
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was actually waiting for somebody to say women who drank any alcohol were sluts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but you just finished a long list of crap beers sluts also drink
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres a good chance yeah tolerating beer taste is manly its no guarantee by any means but ive definitely noticed a correlation getting into beer usually happens from much drinking experience but a girl that likes taking shots is a way better slut tell
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so were whores if were frugal and were only high class if we spend money like water got it and you wonder why there are so many golddiggers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly especially when you sweat the metabolites of that shit out of your pores yecch
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,😂😂😂
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,seriously fuck nuance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but do tell me why all women should be treated in just one way and all men another as this is not my position im not really sure i find that the people who advocate that kind of social change usually argue that men are privileged and that certain social norms and beliefs are harmful towards the advancement of women etc but otherwise im not sure i lack the hubris needed to lecture all of society about how certain behaviours are bad while others are good etc i dont know what the problem is but i dont think the disparity in how men and women morally evaluate each others sexual exploits is proof positive of sexism especially given their dieting sexual biology and roles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill get the popcorn ready a troll that can feed itself now ive seen everything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats it i knew there had to be something wrong with it but just couldnt remember what with all the other tells im contending with thank you for reminding me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i played dominoes with some gfs the other night i wonder if that is a slut tell because somebody at the table also drank hard liquor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,an attention seeking homebody so like you have a developed extroverted and introverted side do you know your mbti type yeah im always seeking attention thats why i generally keep to myself at work and prefer to spend time at home totally an extroverted attention seeker ya got me obviously youre wrong i dont remember my mbti results they varied a little each time i think they were either int or ist or inf depending not sure about the rest not interested in going through the test again do you consider yourself to be promiscuous its pretty obvious from even just skimming through my comments that im not nor do i think of myself as such
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,k whatever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if a girl was walking around in a miniskirt in a grocery store around here yes she would stand out in a bad way in the context of sluts skimpy outfits and cold weather anybody around here would know exactly what im talking about dumb drunk hoes bar hopping its common enough that youd have to be blind not to notice this where i live the important point is not the alcohol its the stupid these are stupid people and theres a lot of them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wish youd found something from ive heard thats when papers were mostly likely to be accurate my point was that you making blatantly false claims is silly since weve had those claims documented as debunked for almost a century but thanks for the unnecessary snark it really shows how much knowledge and good faith you bring to the sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,his slut tell is any woman dating after
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you are saying a blonde black person is unnatural and a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plenty of black minority women in the media have blonde or light brown hair that looks professional you sound like a guy who cant tell when women are wearing makeup either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont put any thought into it the whole process is fairly automatic in my brain and functions pretty well where thought goes in is when people ask a question and you try to formulate these thoughts into words i wouldnt say dicey but yeah fair enough if i see a pound girl downing beers with no visible effect and tells me her a dad is an alcoholic do you think thats dicey
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure unfortunately biology and sexual predilections arent past this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just ran the numbers using the cdc nsfg data set for partner count vs parental situation at age for interviewee living with both biological parents living with biological parent not living with either biological parent partner count results median mean living with both biological parents together living with biological parent not living with biological parents lewis is onto something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i may need to explore ciders more i seem to remember them being too sweet and i dont like a lot of sweet alcohol if there are some that arent so sweet i might give them a try though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so i should drink wine when i am out to make sure i am not giving off slut tells
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,manly doesnt equal slut i know some girls who are practically like men and theyre virgins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was a mickeys mahorse myself we tried drinking one again for funsies in our late and looking back on it its a miracle i survived years of that stuff
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just think a lot of brains are wired to make excuses for their own behavior while ruthlessly judging others and some people have a meltdown whenever theyre confronted with a deviation from their abstract ideals especially if they think in black and white it explains every flavor of hypocrisy whether left right or center
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh definitely i would say that rpers should open up an askbox so we can confirm what is or isnt a slut tell for personal knowledge but seems pointless when every answer is just going to be yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do your tats have significant meaning to you do you have a sleeve what sort of piercings are you in an ltr currently
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,indeed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well thats really different they might be hitting a club later or planning to dance only an idiot rugs up for that kind of environment regardless of the weather outside taking a coat to a night club is a heap of hassle makes it hard to dance if you check it theres a higher chance itll get lost would rather be cold for a few minutes between the door of the club and my uber than lose an item of clothing thats context is key idk why you think her standing out in a bad way is relevant i dont really care about that im just saying your omg so stupid cause its cold line doesnt make sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its usually hot in barsclubs a lot of times its just easier to skip the coat and just be a little cold in between bars than having to deal with finding a place for your coat once youre inside granted im not wearing high heels and miniskirts most of the time but i wear skirts and sandals pretty much all year even in winter unless its wet or snowy outside i dont like dealing with bulk and layers once im inside its annoying uncomfortable and i have a habit of forgetting my coat when i leave
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah nyc gets pretty cold i usually get the same weather just a few days beforeafter the windchill and lack of sun is what kills you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah shows how much snark i bring to the sub and thats about it i was ironically reading you super obtusely the same way you did me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then again he thinks every girl is a slut as soon as shes born lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you are saying a blonde black person is unnatural yeah doesnt exist naturally and a slut probably not certainly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plenty of black women in the media have blonde or light brown hair and it doesnt look unprofessional in the least i didnt say it was unprofessional its just inherently unnatural you sound like a guy who cant tell when women are wearing makeup either haha the natural look looks like no make up to me at least till i see her with actually no make up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no itd be dicey if i actually saw her drinking a lot regularly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think both are correlated with a tertium quid my guess is poverty or parental educational level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not a fan of sweet drinks either but there are some ciders i dont mind im blanking on specific names at the moment its been a while since i had one i liked in general i prefer liquor mostly whiskey to winebeercider
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ugh i hate wine i just like bitter tastes better than sweet tastes is it a slut tell that i prefer dark chocolate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol i have a hard time believing you worry about your own slut tells too much wine is no good too high class slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sluts value sex for fun which is highly masculine behavior and thinking it doesnt mean all manly girls are sluts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nice did you ever get into four loko a poor mans speedball my friend still drinks that into his lmao
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,said a person whos sick of hearing well you just dont understand nuance as a scape goatpersonal attack sounds like pretentious hipsters doing things ironically all youre doing spouting that trashfire of a rebuttal is trying to obfuscate the point using word games and semantics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think what it comes down to for trp is that all women are sluts except for the unicorn women that they are partnered with or married to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do your tats have significant meaning to you do you have a sleeve what sort of piercings yes to most partial septum thinking about labret probably wont do it though are you in an ltr currently married
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im just saying your omg so stupid cause its cold line doesnt make sense its not difficult or expensive to check a coat if they are worried about losing there coat yes im going to think theyre stupid or generally irresponsible sure comfort is a reasonable argument and sometimes youre not walking far or waiting in a long line but when the weather is a homeless guy died tonight cold it most certainly doesnt speak well for their intelligence would rather be cold for a few minutes between the door of the club and my uber than lose an item of clothing thats btw this isnt remotely im talking about everyone does this im talking about people walking or waiting in line for an hour for the popular club
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i totally agree with all the coat hassle and in certain situations i agree it is totally reasonable on the other hand theres certainly no shortage of vain idiots going out in a blizzard wearing basically nothing and waiting in the hour line that always exists at said club thats what coatcheck planning ahead and taking ubers are for
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if think beyonces hair is tantamount to some punk rocker you sound a bit off it looks like we really arent on the same page here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so on a person who doesnt drink a lot thats a bac in the neighborhood of you wouldnt notice that nothing would stand out as weird to you or potentially alarming
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wouldnt surprise me on a relevant note as far as i can remember women from higher socioeconomic households reported less partners men from higher socioeconomic households reported more partners
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,interesting maybe i will research it i stopped drinking wine when i lost my taste for sweet stuff but i will occasionally treat myself to champagne because i still get an odd fancy feeling from it ha so maybe if i can get something around the same sweetness level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can we eat chocolate with almonds stir fry oranges
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like the high of wine so slosshy but whites are so sweet i like reds in general though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ugh i hate wine i just like bitter tastes better than sweet tastes whats with all the people in this thread that think wine has to be sweet the word dry means not sweet in regards to wine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not sure i understand your comment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,idk some of the most girly girls have the highest ncounts think sorority girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh raptor jesus no i found out i could put down a fifth of jager but a single jagerbomb would cause me to blackout for a few hours so i never got into the caffeinealcohol craze
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,seriously though your post said some women have dude brains yes straight men are hypocrites for thinking any less of them when they both behave the same way sure were stereotyping now but that about covers it implying that women should never be thought less of by straight men for any reason nah that was just you getting high and exploring a cosmic rainbow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe some of their sos or wives arent even safe though so who knows relief for me but sucks for them and the women around them those that actively resent others
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah cool what do they mean to you having meaningful tattoos is very different septum piercings are different too neither are particularly slut tells how long have you been married
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would you think someone is stupid or irresponsible because they dont trust coat check at a night club its not the most secure of things shit goes missing from those places ive seen it happen a million times you check your shit go back to get it and boom its gone ive accidentally left with someone elses coat from a club before realising and running back lmao and what if its the kind of venue that doesnt have that facility warehouse party rave etc i am not wearing a coat because im going to get hot therell be nowhere to put it and ill either be miserable or lose it i think the ppl who shiver in the line dont realise that theres gonna be a line generally theye the types who never go out i stood next to a group of cute accountants like this once they were so confused by everything and so sad and cold poor kittens also alcohol blanket if people are drank then they shouldnt be cold
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah if youre gonna be outside more than a couple minutes then it is dumb not to bundle up a bit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i wouldnt notice it assuming its in a party situation i dont count peoples drinks no if i did count them id be impressedconfused that she can handle it that well what else am i supposed to think
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats self report i wouldnt be surprised if its less partners for both higher ses and more partners for both lower ses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wait have you not heard of dry wine there is a whole world of not sweet wine out there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wine just makes me sleepy lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ugh i hate it when you say things i agree with gross
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dry white have you never heard of dry whites sauvignon blanc chardonnay etc etc etc etc a world of not sweet wine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats true i guess sweet was the wrong word more liketart idk i dont like most fruit or fruit derivatives even nonsweet ones although weirdly i do enjoy some ciders
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i drink mostly piss natty but have never mixed it with caffeine either do you think jager really has deer blood in it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,straight men are hypocrites for thinking any less of them sostraight women are hypocrites for thinking any less of feminine men and not dating them you must either be years old or trying to sneak a peek into the adult inter sexual relationships p
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,getting high and exploring a cosmic rainbow havent done that since college
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah cool what do they mean to you its private my less personal one is an octopus just because i think theyre cool i also have ngefma related tattoos because they were series i enjoyed over the years i think ginkgo trees are pretty cool and different kinds of flowers so my next tattoos will probably incorporate those septum piercings are different too neither are particularly slut tells well thats not what all the men here are saying now is it how long have you been married a little over a year and a half
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not the most secure of things shit goes missing from those places ive seen it happen a million times except you never leave the venue without your winter jacket here granted that sometimes someone is super drunk and forgets there jacket or somebody has an identical jacket mistakes are pretty uncommon and if it does its typically your fault and what if its the kind of venue that doesnt have that facility because its cold af here everywhere has that shit everyone has multiple winter coats of varying thickness people incessantly check the weather for conditions before leaving their home with windchill on the right night you can get frostbite doesnt ever stop these types from standing around making sure they look good and pretending its not cold as shit if you disregarded every winter advisory warning and not doing what literally everyone else around you manages to do without any problems whatsoever so you can look good in front of drunk people who couldnt give a fuck yeah youre probably stupid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what else am i supposed to think pretty good cue that you should be watching for behavior consistent with alcoholism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,again itd be dicey if i actually saw her drinking a lot regularly no need to see her once at a party downing drinks first
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hey we require post text sufficient to explain any linked materials please provide more information summarizing the links in your post thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as usual i dont claim to speak for all women™ or all men™ but these are my thoughts one of the biggest misconceptions men have is how women assess potential sex partners they project their own male thinking on women men as this has been described to me evaluate the women they see subconsciously or not in a sexual context ugh id do sordid things to that new chick in payroll or yes id do her ew no way shes cute i bet shes a freak ooh a milf women dont really think like this we appreciate a good looking dude but if were ever going to think about him sexually itll be after weve gotten to know him or know about him a bit ive known super hot guys that turned out to be weird or rude as fuck and it totally ruined any interest i might have had in them we almost never sexualize the guys we encounter on a daytoday basis they need to sexualize themselves to get on our radar some guys have to really work at that and some are natural flirts who can do it without even trying it depends on his personality and demeanor this is why if you sit around waiting for your female friend to take notice of you without building some tension youll be waiting forever there are no yes and no buckets for dudes we know its just not a thought that often occurs to us our attraction also isnt as linear as mens the hotter the girl the more they want to fuck her speaking for myself and other women i know im pretty average looking and theyre average to above id say when we see a smoking hot dude our first thought is hes intimidating he probably has a girlfriend and shes probably a thousand times prettier than me so we dont even try we might catch ourselves miring but we wont make a move and even if that guy made a move on us wed sabotage it its just uncomfortable being around a guy whos that much hotter than you it brings all of our flaws into focus this of course all depends on a girls selfperception if she thinks shes hot shit shes more likely to go for it regardless of how others rate her appearance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so basically men and women approach and respond differently when it comes to sex the brain is the largest sex organ and game is really important i feel like you are doing a good job of making rps case here maybe this will help the looks are the only thing that matters crowd i dont know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to the terps moaning on about but trp teaches all this anyway i read these findings as more of a rebuttal against manosphere assertions such as the rule all girls are interested in is chad etc etc op do you concur
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,relevant summaries i using fmri scientists have pinpointed a number of regions of the brain that kick in when people feel sexual desire as expected several of them are in the temporal lobe one of those regions the amygdala orchestrates powerful emotions another the hippocampus manages our memories it may become active as we associate sights and smells with past sexual experiences but despite what freud thought sexual experiences are not just a matter of primal emotions and associations the parts of the brain that light up in the fmri scans include regions that are associated with some of our most sophisticated forms of thought the anterior insula for instance is what we use to reflect on the state of our own bodies to be aware of the sensation of butterflies in the stomach say or of lightness in the head brain regions that are associated with understanding the thoughts and intentions of other people also seem linked with sexual feelings ii based on the literature reviewed we conclude that content characteristics may differentially produce higher levels of sexual arousal in men and women specifically men appear more influenced by the sex of the actors depicted in the stimuli while womens response may differ with the context presented sexual motivation perceived gender role expectations and sexual attitudes are possible influences these differences are of practical importance to future research on sexual arousal that aims to use experimental stimuli comparably appealing to men and women and also for general understanding of cognitive sex differences its an evaluation of many many studies going back over years although both men and women responded to porn women responded better to actual signs of intimacy like foreplay regardless of whether they were watching straight or same sex those on the pill were more likely to seek out more context in the background of what they were watching theres more such as women reporting a difference between physical attraction and mental that wasnt seen among men it remains an underexplored subject iii in study n women men we exposed individuals to faces twice and found that faces were judged as more attractive on the second rating reflecting attraction to familiar faces with the exception that mens ratings of female faces decreased on the second rating demonstrating attraction to novelty in studies n women men and n women men exposure particularly decreased mens ratings of womens attractiveness for shortterm relationships and their sexiness in study n women men womens attraction to faces was positively related to selfrated similarity to their current partners face while the effect was significantly weaker for men potentially mens attraction to novelty may reflect an adaptation promoting the acquisition of a high number of sexual partners not only do women rate familiar faces higher but they prefer faces similar to their own the claim that a night of sex with chad ruins a woman for life is not only fiction but the exact opposite of every experiment and most peoples real world experience
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,contrary to the redpills understanding of evolutionary psychology were not just helpless slaves to our most primitive instincts women dont want to appear so shallow when they describe what they really like about a man so shell say i like his personality he has a great sense of humor hes intellectually stimulating but her vagina and emotions respond to his i agree to an extent that good storytelling and intellectuallystimulating conversations can arouse a woman but if the man is a scrawny or unmuscular beta she wont give him the time of day except for when shes looking for a nsfw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is pretty red pill stuff not rtheredpill but red pill nonetheless
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,many women prefer a familiar face which could be why white women are more racist when it comes to dating just look at our cartoons and the shows we watched as kids i can recall plenty where white male characters were paired with another ethnicity female character but the only show that comes to mind with white females interacting with another ethnicity male character is the magic school bus representation matters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,itt someone is a fucking liar
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the first link simply describes the heavy use of the brain in sexual pleasure nothing about intelligence or higher order thinking here it emphasizes the idea sex is urged based second link has nothing to do with higher order thinking women seem to subjectively react positively to stimuli that allow them to project themselves into the situation while men prefer stimuli enabling objectification of the actors exactly women project themselves in scenarios of being dominated by masculine men this is where the tingles come from they think about fantasies with masculine men third link is more obvious stuff visual preferences for novelty in oppositesex stimuli in men are consistent with a male preference for a greater number of partners and a greater interest in shortterm relationships than women what is the point of this thread its written very autistically edit were not just helpless slaves to our most primitive instincts nothing in that link says anything about primitive vs modern instincts on the contrary heavy usage of un explained brain activity support the idea its primitive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this study seems more a takedown of bp as it clearly says men and women are different in sexual preferences and bpers are often trying to minimize those differences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,science says sexual attraction often involves higher order thinking of course it does when the panties moisten the hamst wheel starts spinning and rewards a familiar face already well known given the statistics showing women have a greater preference for their own race than men women are notoriously xenophobic and hostile towards the unknown and unfamliar
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its still a numbers game pbi probablybelievesit context well duh but that is part of running the numbers more to follow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i followed the link and perhaps it explains why i can punch above my weight the term i like is imagineering you build a reality for you and your so to occupy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sorry about that edited does it work now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have been saying this forever on this sub probably not as eloquently women dont get attracted to men the way men get attracted to women instant sexual attraction based on hotness factor alone isnt so much of a woman thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes both sexes exhibit solipsism it is only exacerbated by the current climate where people view the sexes as the same people dont understand that they think different and when people try to bring that difference up bp types tend to try and minimize it much to the confusion of everyone else edit typo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we almost never sexualize the guys we encounter on a daytoday basis they need to sexualize themselves to get on our radar you know what you just about wrapped up most of what i learned in rp with that one sentence it seems awfully simple but when you dig deep into it its nothing of the sort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think men necessarily fantasise about the sexual acts they are going to perform with the women they see its more like a subconscious rating system like virtual reality glasses that project a number above everyones head and inject a small shot of hormones depending on the number of the person that he is looking at your point about guys that are too hot applies to men too its why many men wont even try with women who have a high paying career
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nice explanation i always explained it with the bitch shield that hot guy just wants to pump n dump realizing that women are hella insecure is important in flirting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thoroughly agree with this comment but the last paragraph in particular is spoton
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if were ever going to think about him sexually itll be after weve gotten to know him or know about him how does this relate to ons please dont say that since you dont do those you dont know feel free to generalize based on observation though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah i see girls making a move on chads all the time if a girl doesnt approach a guy its because she isnt attracted to him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,interesting is there anything a guy can do to present himself as less sexual to women i want to seem like i have no romantic interest in women whatsoever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we might catch ourselves miring but we wont make a move you wont make a move on the unattractive guy either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,since when have i ever disagreed that the brain is the largest sex organ or said men and women were identical i just prefer that rough heuristics remain a starting point rather than a destination also the subjective context someone attaches to your game kind of matters doesnt it its not a one size fits all deal and yeah i know some redpills regard this all as painfully obvious but so many so clearly dont
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe this will help the looks are the only thing that matters crowd i dont know looks are the primary arbiter of sexual attraction there is nothing that anyone can or will ever say that will change this you can post onemillion threads on ppd you can espouse the virtues of rp til the cows come home nothing will ever change this of course people who say looks are the only thing that matters are too fundamentalist but they are closer to being correct than those who deny the primary importance of looks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except rp still pumps out really dumb hindbrain nonsense like all women are attracted to a short list of behaviors and any chick ever will sleep with chad women are more complicated than that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah youve done a great job of summing it all up thanks i completely forgot about the rule now ive got to try to forget it all over again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the rule all girls are interested in is chad etc etc op do you concur no where in any of those studies was a frequency of casual sex discussed the idea of women being attracted to context doesnt rebut any rp ideas there is a reason women are attracted to bad boys or taboo sort of scenarios hence context
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i saw a really interesting study recently and i forgot to link it here if i ever find the source again i will post it here this study puts its closer to and mathematically no they do not get all the women the findings said the top ten percentile of attractive men have access to an exponentially higher amount of women or receive an exponentially higher amount of the attention from women it was something like that ill have to find it i think the supplydemand curve was kind of the inverse for women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes you are did you just try to counter all that neurology with someones wild stab at a just so story cmon even modern evo psych admits most women get genes and share money with the same guy you also included a youtube link to a meat market because of course you did and a cartoon from a guy who draws like a year old well im convinced
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you even going to try and address any of the actual studies he linked
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is not the refutation you believe it to be might as well link thessalonians
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love that link the crux of the argument only if she is very lucky will they be the same man is completely unsupported its the old people who are attractive must be dumb or bitchy thrown near a scientific opinion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you just skimmed didnt you the first link simply describes the heavy use of the brain in sexual pleasure nothing about intelligence or higher order thinking here like this but despite what freud thought sexual experiences are not just a matter of primal emotions and associations the parts of the brain that light up in the fmri scans include regions that are associated with some of our most sophisticated forms of thought the anterior insula for instance is what we use to reflect on the state of our own bodies to be aware of the sensation of butterflies in the stomach say or of lightness in the head brain regions that are associated with understanding the thoughts and intentions of other people also seem linked with sexual feelings the title of the article was even about that part next exactly women project themselves in scenarios of being dominated by masculine men okay meanwhile women in contrast did not show a difference in reported sexual arousal between heterosexual or female homosexual films on to the the third link which has quite a bit to say about the cock carousel and the fear of commitment not to mention how average guys often make themselves more attractive without rippling abs what is the point of this thread its written very autistically i might ask the same of your post if i didnt give those on the autism spectrum more credit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have to agree with uprobablybelievesit on this one that perhaps you only skimmed the articles while none of these studies are so damning we can shut ppd down the implications are that womens sexual attraction isnt quite what a lot of rpers pronounce although im not necessarily referring to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp told me that being a good storyteller is important
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,better but honestly more info would make the thread a lot bettereasier for people maybe copy and paste some relevant sections from the articles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its more that we understand what a venn diagram is if the some of the folks here tried investigating the visible light spectrum theyd only ever get as far as two primaries
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its why many men wont even try with women who have a high paying career what does career have to do with anything you rather got after girls who you think will be impressed by your bank account also as a woman with a high paying career one day lol ive actually had men seem more into me after they know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in my case the virtual number usually sits right on her ass but other than that id agree p
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly that has never crossed my mind its more like i dont want to accidentally seem interested because hes way out of my league and will probably laugh at me so i wont even make eye contact apparently everybodys just an insecure basket case deep down
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most women arent having onss and i would imagine that with those who do theres usually alcohol involved which can lower inhibitions and manufacture attraction so to speak
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how does this relate to ons my best answer to that would be in written by a feminist sex expert quote aside from the apparent gender split what are the characteristics of people who experience casual sex as usually fun those who experience it as usually boring and those who experience it as usually destructive from my experiences and observations it seems to me that people who absolutely love casual sex often have a lot of physical turnons as opposed to psychological ones are not carrying difficult feelings from abusive sexual experiences dont tend to get attached to partners quickly or know how to manage their experiences so that they dont get attached a friend once told me about a woman who never allowed herself to have orgasms during casual sex because she had observed of herself that she started getting emotionally attached quite quickly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have no idea why you would think game is a one size fits all deal game is one of the hardest elements to master harder than say hitting the gym or dressing well because its not one size fits all its an art a way of being not a todo list
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when you have zero game a good place to start is a shotgun strategy one size fits all approach focus on the most common and easiest to learn stuff as you improve you are going to start recognizing the little details in different demographics groups only then will you learn how different groups respond to different things want to know the real reason everyone talks about alpha traits so much they already learned beta and know it pretty well usually theyre lacking in alpha and not the other way around the big mistake of a lot of trpers is not recognizing that beta has its uses as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,looks are only super important at the extremes elephant man and supermodel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,okay so riddle me this ive had essentially the same look with some developments that happen with age of course some good some not as good since the time i was old enough to be sexually active during my life ive had times where i had crazy sexual successes like never in a million years did i ever think i could hook up with a girl like this and times where i was in such a drought that i literally got no sexual attention from any females for even years additionally one of my worst droughts occurred when i was arguably my most superficially attractive ripped body spectacular wardrobe plenty of cash to drop on exciting times but i couldnt even turn my wife on even she didnt want to fuck me whereas one of the times i was at the top of my sexual game i was outofshape had a mostlyboring wardrobe and was broke as a joke with no impressive career prospects but yet i was batting well out of my league on a fairly regular basis so what gives if looks are what sexual attraction is all about how come i have friends that are very goodlooking way better looking than i have ever been and have some status but can only get laid by women well below them in smv i would say that it is because they are timid and passive and act like obsequious doormats around women but what would be your theory as to their failure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,last i checked the hindbrain is a major component of our brain i know that nerds love to imagine that the cognitive abilities granted by our prefrontal cortex is some superpower that negates all other factors in behavior but almost no one outside of nerds shares that view and women are attracted to a relatively short list of behaviors how is that making attraction simplistic those behaviors are not simplistic so the responses wouldnt be either and chad is the dude that women will jump into bed with without much reservation and without setting conditions yes some women might not under any circumstances indulge in a fling or a romp but many many more will most in my experience
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is a reason women are attracted to bad boys or taboo sort of scenarios yeah theyre all fun to explore but outliers aside there are limits in how far you can go before it stops being attractive besides youre ignoring everything else sexual attraction can be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even modern evo psych admits most women get genes and share money with the same guy and the majority of those guys are strong handsome and exhibit alpha qualities a womans simply will not allow her to get pregnant by a man she perceives is beta because she feels no sexual attraction for him though she might do it only as last resort for survival through access to his resources which the comic suggests good conversation and personality are secondary to the greater importance of good genes from strong masculine men her body responds to such men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the argument only if she is very lucky will they be the same man is completely unsupported implying httpssinglemotherguidecomsinglemotherstatistics dont exist its the old people who are attractive must be dumb or bitchy thrown near a scientific opinion oh i agree there are intelligent goodnatured people at all levels of attractiveness but in terms of a womans biological imperative looks are more important than intelligence or personality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not to mention how average guys often make themselves more attractive without rippling abs ive made myself significantly more attractive throughout my life only once did i even come close to having rippling abs by and large rippling abs didnt really do much for me comparatively i feel like you are questioning the looks are all that matters line in a lot of your arguments but i wouldnt say that is an rp view there are plenty of rpers who werent fugly or in pathetic shape yet still had lots of problems with their sexlove life i was one despite what so many incels want to believe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,arent we all on the autism spectrum somewhere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the parts of the brain that light up in the fmri scans include regions that are associated with some of our most sophisticated forms of thought the anterior insula for instance is what we use to reflect on the state of our own bodies to be aware of the sensation of butterflies in the stomach say or of lightness in the head brain regions that are associated with understanding the thoughts and intentions of other people also seem linked with sexual feelings yes intentions this can be dominance assertiveness confidence etc the idea of being desired by a masculine guy is intoxicating to women i dont get what part of trp you are trying to argue against here no where in these studies was it mentioned anything like women dont like masculinity or they prefer skinnier over muscular men there is no support for the idea of intellect influencing sexual desire either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then why are so many field reports so bad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wrote a separate post for those who dont want to read a wall of text in the main body
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im usually a fan of analogies but this doesnt make any sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont go after girls but others have told me they dont try with women who have a high paying career because they expect that those women would want a man with an even more high paying career its not that they dont like a woman with a high paying career but that they rightly or wrongly expect rejection which is painful so they dont initiate if the woman initiated they would probably respond
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive actually had men seem more into me after they know maybe he has aspirations of being a kept man my first thought is gold digger but im an old cynical bastard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not to be mean and not saying theres anything wrong with it but that is kind of insecure you wouldnt approach because of a potential negative reaction to your appearance i used to think like this when i was in grade school i used to think about what league i was in compared to the girl i liked i was more aware of my popularity and where i stood so to speak nowadays if i want something i pretty much just start thinking about how im going to get it then act including women i know there are millions of people who are better looking have better jobs and are more interesting than me but it doesnt stop me of thinking of myself as a top tier individual i suppose as a man you usually have to think highly of yourself if you want to be romantically successful you dont have to develop this skill if youre a woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,at least as many women as men i would imagine so you know my question stands as for alcohol it just lowers inhibitions and since one partakes one wants inhibitions lowered makes me wonder why in the case of women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this does not answer my question with regard to the above statement about attraction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have been kept busy with other stuff my shieldsister i shall return to irc to please thy kind heart
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,game is one of the hardest elements to master harder than say hitting the gym or dressing well because its not one size fits all its an art a way of being not a todo list okaywait explain game to me because from what i understood the way most apply it its best described as somewhere between a carnys hustle for attention and a verbal dancebattle and the idea is to avoid making a genuine connection or you lose mastery requires reliably turning no into a yes no matter how many women you annoy on your heros journey i was assured that if you only ever take women up on that kind of sparringchase when theyre in the mood for it or get too creative with any of the script youre a blue pill beta cuck white knight mangina who has no place sabotaging honest men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have no idea why you would think game is a one size fits all deal where does this come from is it because awalt ive been reading the sphere since and ive never once ever seen anyone of note state that game is one size fits all ever ive seen plenty say that the same things work on many women but that when it comes down to an individual woman game must be tailored for the audience
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,during my life ive had times where i had crazy sexual successes like never in a million years did i ever think i could hook up with a girl like this and times where i was in such a drought that i literally got no sexual attention from any females for even years me too mate you can try to figure these things out but sometimes there is no rhyme nor reason to them what i believe to be the case is that womens attraction to men is very individual you can put an archetypally attractive woman in front of ten men and they will almost certainly all consider her attractive but it just doesnt work that way for women ive been with female friends and girlfriends and asked her do you find attractive and they are literally turning their noses up at them and disgusted by the prospect but then one on my friends girlfriends used to really like whats his name out of star trek that bald guy and i used to say to her rach hes a fucking pensioner hell be getting his free bus pass soon you are literally young enough to be his granddaughter doesnt make any difference every girlfriend i have had has thought that i was special the woman im dating now described me as lovely very soon after meeting me but most women i come into contact with are completely indifferent to me like most guys ive been down so many blind alleys trying to attract women who i could never attract i wish i had that time back you cant rhyme nor reason attraction and there is more to it than looks alone thats why i say that those who claim otherwise are fundamentalists and misguided but if she doesnt like the look of you pretty quickly you have got a tough job on attracting her the chemical processes required to generate attraction will never begin its like to trying to drive a car without petrol gas if you prefer if you want to know why you have been successful at one time as opposed to another i would suggest that you were simply more proactive when you were more successful additionally you can never underestimate the power of luck you just have to keep plugging away until you find the women who are interested in you and sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it does not even those who avidly believe in game will concede that most women will not be attracted to you whatever you do so if youre in a zerosum game which you lose more often than not it stands to reason that you will have droughts if you are not incredibly proactive or possibly even if you are
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know that nerds love to imagine that the cognitive abilities granted by our prefrontal cortex is some superpower that negates all other factors in behavior but almost no one outside of nerds shares that view til nearly every single sectionof psychology sociology and behavioral science are just nerds social and behavioral conditioning are a thing slice dawg and women are attracted to a relatively short list of behaviors not really there are tons and tons of different turn ons and attractions where is operating a manual transmission an alpha chad trait and chad is the dude that women will jump into bed with without much reservation and without setting conditions yes some women might not under any circumstances indulge in a fling or a romp but many many more will most in my experience sure thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like how whenever we talk about high betabeta fucks the women are all over it and my own experience tells me it exists but im supposed to give a damn what some dude on the internet said about how every woman just wants to have a kid with the local pump and dump badboy fucktoy it doesnt matter how much scripture you quote at me im an atheist your internet bible isnt even good toilet paper find me an actual fact to debate not another theory
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only for those who have to settle good looking people with good personalities dont settle for someone with only one of those attributes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair point but we do see a lot of rpleaning or selfprofessed folk here who seem to take that view i think a lot of you what i call more grounded folk dont say stuff like that of course you dont normally espouse the absolutist and extreme views that we see repeated ad nauseam from these same people either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the idea of being desired by a masculine guy is intoxicating to women if theyre attracted to that masculine guy sure many women like masculine guys this can be dominance assertiveness confidence etc indeed it can be no where in these studies was it mentioned anything like women dont like masculinity or they prefer skinnier over muscular men it didnt say one thing about a type at all it did however demonstrate a more complex interaction going on in the brain than teehee he treats me like dirt but hes so hawt ahmygawddd which seems to pop up whenever the redpill tries and fails to explain single parenthood it also reveals how pointless trying to create a single objective measure of attraction is and the amount of selfdeception going on with many of the men who post here there is no support for the idea of intellect influencing sexual desire either of course intelligence never influences or inspires someones subjective reactions to you and it has nothing to do with getting someone excited about your own thoughts and intentions stem is all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am not them so i wont defend their views or their story telling
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are a lot of factors that go into someones personality besides male and female socialization cant be completely excluded also whats their t count how do they respond to novel situations do they prefer excitement or comfort can they handle pressure one easy example most women dont like a ons some love hooking up with strangers and pushing their limits which one best represents awalt and why do you insist on claiming one set of core instincts for women and a completely separate one for men in the first place nothing ive linked indicates anything more than most or many
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah i see
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,idk it always sort of came off to me as if they were nicely surprised i always took it complimentary as if they were happy to find me attractive and smart but maybe that was just me being idealistic lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im confident about some things and totally insecure about others i dont deny that i was a fat frumpy kid growing up im pretty solidly averagelooking now but its tough to overcome an ugly selfimage but youre thinking like a man here a guy can overcome an unattractive appearance much easier than a woman can men value beauty more than women in a partner an unattractive or fat or older woman is going to have a hell of a time choosing a man and deciding to make him hers she might be able to accomplish it if shes really charming but shell have a harder time than if the genders were reversed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not to be mean and not saying theres anything wrong with it but that is kind of insecure you wouldnt approach because of a potential negative reaction to your appearance perspective women also dont approach because the pay off is nothing why approach for a pump dump scoring sexually is a loss for a woman and a gain for a man this is where sexual fluidity helps women too she can find a man in her league which will give equal better tingles because more security better connection her attraction is founded on a lot more than looks which seems very hard for men to understand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would imagine there are vastly less women who actually want onss then men partly for the reasons we have articulated maybe thats partly why according to yall only the top percentage of men get a lot of the casual sex because theres a very low demand for onss from women and a high demand from men as for alcohol you do shit and people you wouldnt do sober hence terms like beer goggles you may not actually be really all that attracted to that person irl perhaps youre just horny and that person scratched an itch idk either way there are certainly women who genuinely like casual sex so they play a role as well maybe their attraction is more akin to mens
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,at least as many women as men i would imagine in any given night yes but if you look at it over a longer time period its the same few chicks that get picked up over and over by different guys you know thats why meat markets have to attract women somehow and keep most guys out of the club
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this does not answer my question with regard to the above statement about attraction for me personally all those years ago when i might have been young and naive enough to try bad ons sex cant be sure since too christian to indulge but now i cant imagine how ons sex appeals the article says women attracted to ons have huge physical turn ons rather than physical this would match what ive heard from women friends ive known who tried it such women were picky about his build body shape etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this reminds me of the sales debate recently i noticed that debate split rp and bp on the question of salesmanship which seems to have been seen by most bpers as at best a necessary evil and at worst something both annoying and reprehensible many also claimed that sales doesnt really work on them which is exactly what they say about game and the smp while i think that badannoyingpotentially evil salespersons are a dime a dozen they dont represent salesmanship and they should not be used as the example same goes for game some dude actually harassing some girl as opposed to say not giving up enitely and immediately at the first whiff of rejection which to me is not the same as harassment is not a good example of someone who has game a guy who is really good at either game or sales will not be seen as a player or a salesman they will be seen as a cool dude who happens to be successful with the opposite sex or in business i love good salespeople when i am wanting to buy something i need someone good i can work with i need someone to sell me on why i should buy something if i was an expert and already knew everything about all the products or services myself i would just buy what i need immediately but since i dont despite the fact that i usually do extensive research prior to making most purchases a good salesperson is invaluable and i find that most women are the same way about game and many like my wife will totally acknowledge that they want to find guys who have good game it makes the whole sexual interaction thing more pleasant and way easier i cant tell you the number of guys though that number would be close to all of them even hot guys that my wife has shot down because of their lack of game and she was often frustrated and disappointed at having to do so since oftentimes they were hot enough to really spark her interest and her experience seems to be more common than not amongst a lot of women just like most people get frustrated as hell with salespeople when they go to say buy a car
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but literally every time anyone on the blue side says the word individual we get drowned out by terps sneering hurr durr special snowflake
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah its probably the whole awalt means all women are the same and can be treated as such at all levels thing essentially awat rather than awalt which is a mistake that seems to get made by all sides honestly but rpers should know better and bpers shouldnt be so quick to favor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would suggest that you were simply more proactive when you were more successful but see now were starting to talk the same language this is not insignificant at least for guys like me who can be as i was and still have been known to be terrified of women or more specifically of being rejected by them or judged by them or seen as that guy by them etc for us being proactive in such a way as to maximize result and minimize blows to selfesteem that might take us out of the game is a very important skill to learn even those who avidly believe in game will concede that most women will not be attracted to you whatever you do well yeah its not like i was ever so successful that i didnt fail astronomically more often than i succeeded lol but heres the thing i have always taken a good hard look at who i was being and what i was doing when i was either succeeding and failing and the differences are usually pretty stark like being confidentproactive is usually part of my success while giving too many fucks and feeling intimidated was usually part of my failure its not like when i found myself suddenly succeeding reliably i was being the same person doing the same things as when i failed when i was a success i was being and acting often prior to actually having any evidence to justify my being and actions like a successful guy would be and act sure i might not have been in great shape or had sharp clothes or had a shitty haircut or whatever but i was confident cockyfunny unintimidatedunintimidatable assertive totally unattached and giving no fucks etc meanwhile when i was failing i was a loser in my own mind sure i might have had everything lined up perfectly physically and presentation wise with meticulous attention to detail such that i looked great on paper but i was unconfident reserved easily intimidated hesitantindecisive giving way too many fucks about what women thought of me deferential etc and no amount of looking good could overcome those basic shortcomings even my wife who loved me couldnt bring herself to want to fuck a guy who was beingacting like that thats why i think the greater emphasis on mentalityattitudeparadigm and game is not at all misplaced when i was a swaggering bastard i could outgame guys much better looking or higher status than i was at least for short periods of time lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,til nearly every single sectionof psychology sociology and behavioral science are just nerds what no you didnt nothing i have ever come across in psychology sociology or behavioral science supports the argument being made in fact most in those fields would find the claim ludicrous the subconscious mind and processes are the primary focus in those fields there are tons and tons of different turn ons and attractions not from anything ive ever either experienced or studied while the specifics can vary widely from individual to individual they all stem from the same innate impulses where is operating a manual transmission an alpha chad trait why operating a manual transmission im guessing that there are a lot of guys who wouldnt be attractive to someone who is turned on by guys who operate a manual transmission just like someone who is turned on by operating a manual transmission might still be aroused by someone who doesnt know how to operate a manual transmission cause at the end of the day i guarantee that for of women who are turned on by operating a manual transmission women for whom that is an attractive thing but not a fetish its not about the ability to operate a manual transmission the ability to operate a manual transmission points to something bigger sure thing so are you agreeing that there exist chads
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you debate like fundamental twerps i dont think that there is a chance to change your mind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but im supposed to give a damn what some dude on the internet said about hmmm i thought this was a debate sub where everyone is allowed to give counterarguments
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i honestly dont care what even the majority of rpers profess if it isnt justified or backed up by the fundamentals of rp as laid out in the reams of source materials its just hard for me to consider it rp i also notice that little effort is made to substantiate certain positions like only looks matter as fundamental to rp and no strongly advocating that men lift and get their presentation on point is not the same as saying thats all you can or need to do its often taken as a given even though most of the fundamentals would dispute that claim
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one easy example most women dont like a ons yes while most men would there is a difference between men and women see it wasnt so hard no need to make up a bunch of fluff
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually i hope you are more correct in your assessment i did clearly indicate cynical and bastard in my comment ive never considered a high pay a negative ive always said my major concerns in that arena are shes gonna need to be putting more time into her career than our family to keep making that bank or im going to have to make more at some point or shell see me as a leach the first of the two is more logical the second is my own personal bias mixed in with cultural upbringing and life examples ive seen which arguably are very limited i could see myself getting comfortable on the second with the right woman but the first would be an issue regardless of that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not saying its wrong our abnormal to be a little insecure i understand its not always easy but consider this i am short ive been treated very poorly at times because of that something out of my control ive been told countless times that it is insecurity i have to overcome its a gendered problem that wouldnt exist if i was female its still insecurity though just one where confidence is the solution
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,insecurity is a feeling in your words the less attractive partner makes her feel more secure meaning insecurity was a factor in her decision making
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right you drink to do things you really want to but are either afraid of doing or want an excuse to do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought this was because men buy the majority of drinks if there are good looking women there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and she was often frustrated and disappointed at having to do so since oftentimes they were hot enough to really spark her interest god yes this its so deflating to meet a hot dude and then have to witness him letting himself down im often cheering for them please be cool please be cool etc and the theyre lame and im all meh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that was my post im so glad you mentioned it because i was thinking the exact same thing when i read his reply this was very written and you have an excellent grasp on what i was trying to get across i also really liked your analogy to loving a good salesperson and your wife i totally agree that i love a good salesperson and if i dont buy something right away i keep that motherfuckers number because some day i might need it how this relates to my girlfriend is also consistent with what your wife says i am constantly gaming her and she fucking loves it makes are relationship a ton of fun
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wont deny that but youve never seen it from me of course since im interested in ltrmarriage i suppose its fair to say im biased toward unicorn hunting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if it comes from awalt it would appear some of yall are talking awalt literally
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wouldnt say attitude doesnt count for anything it does what i am saying is that looks are the primary arbiter of attraction if they were not then it would be great you could approach any woman and your attitude would seal the deal we all know its not like that while this cannot be entirely attributed to looks it is the primary driver of attraction i certainly dont agree with people who say looks are the only thing that matters that is plain daft but undoubtedly physical attraction plays a massive part in whether or not you have a chance with someone of course you still have to make a move no matter what you look like
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not like when i found myself suddenly succeeding reliably i was being the same person doing the same things as when i failed when i was a success i was being and acting often prior to actually having any evidence to justify my being and actions like a successful guy would be and act sure i might not have been in great shape or had sharp clothes or had a shitty haircut or whatever but i was confident cockyfunny unintimidatedunintimidatable assertive totally unattached and giving no fucks etc sighs you just did a good job of describing why i immediately wind up in a new bad relationship the exact moment i decide im enjoying my freedom if you dont mind answering whats a good sign to look for in a potential partner keeping in mind that im not going to be scared off by a woman who behaves like a guy if anything itll be the opposite despite my frequent flirtations with common sense tomboys usually figure out how to deactivate it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what no you didnt nothing i have ever come across in psychology sociology or behavioral science supports the argument being made in fact most in those fields would find the claim ludicrous im going to go with the years i spent studying for a criminology degree over your exp sorry not from anything ive ever either experienced or studied while the specifics can vary widely from individual to individual they all stem from the same innate impulses except many of those are culturally coded and or culminations of more than just hind brain urges why operating a manual transmission im guessing that there are a lot of guys who wouldnt be attractive to someone who is turned on by guys who operate a manual transmission just like someone who is turned on by operating a manual transmission might still be aroused by someone who doesnt know how to operate a manual transmission cause at the end of the day i guarantee that for of women who are turned on by operating a manual transmission women for whom that is an attractive thing but not a fetish its not about the ability to operate a manual transmission the ability to operate a manual transmission points to something bigger there are tons of women who find forearms to be really really hot when throwing a stickshift around its gotten me action before a lot of that is cultural or contextual so are you agreeing that there exist chads im agreeing the chad delusion is too strong to even argue about here attractive dudes get easier action but there is no angelic perfection of chadliness that just makes women have sex because their teeny tiny little brains cant say no to their urges
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you mean you wont convince me to join your cult like women blaming machine that is supported by near zero of my life experience and sex life by making assertions backed by comics and your zany self help books oh my
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not actually a counter argument its just a some guy said the world works this way you have a choice of dealing with it or clinging to an obsolete mythology your call
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lot of it is just fundamental rp principles taken to their most logical extremes despite the fact that the resulting conclusion is absurd awalt becomes literal afbb becomes no married woman is attracted to her husband becomes women only have casual sex with chads
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most and even then sometimes people act of character for themselves or experiment with other alternatives or simply change youre basically asking us to stick to the basic introductory course and complaining whenever we prefer something more useful and relevant to our own lives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in your words the less attractive partner makes her feel more secure meaning insecurity was a factor in her decision making security as a factor for what yes security is a factor in attraction but my point was something different a major disconnect between the sexes is that women dont seepump dump as a reward or something to pursue even if the guy is hot guys seem to find any kind of sex rewarding some women find casual ons rewarding but most dont then puaep others make generalizations about women in general from an unusual data sample women who like ons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah you do a lot of things you actually dont want to do you also let your guard down more and are more pliablesusceptible to pressure not that thats every case or anything but certainly some women have gone to bed with a man after drinking and then woken up and thought yuck not attractive at all why hence the beer goggles thing they werent actually attracted it was manufactured but again i think there are a minority of women who actually do enjoy and seek out onss
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats damn funny my wifes mantra was be cool that was her number one request of men now given that i have lots of insider information i can tell you that be cool is distinct from be passive or be deferential or be her friend or be unassertive and yes walking that line is a trick for sure one that many guys dont know how to pull off as i witnessed firsthand literally hundreds of times
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i dont buy something right away i keep that motherfuckers number because some day i might need it no doubt i once spent a year and a half trying to find a good real estate agent i disqualified so many its not even funny never try to bullshit a bullshitter lol i finally found one though and she and i still stay in touch nine years later i also wouldnt dream of ever working with anyone else and she is the only agent ive ever recommended to others and as such shes gotten a lot of clients from me good businesspeople sales or otherwise are worth their weight in gold
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,true you are the one good terp after all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like i said i think there is a big difference between awalt and awat though that difference is often overlooked and thats a dangerous oversight as it leads to men believing in unicorns which does no one including women any good
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course you still have to make a move no matter what you look like you have to make a good move ive often made moves in life and the fallout from not having made those moves good ones can be demoralizing as hell so i was motivated to learn the difference between make a move and make a move that will actually cause something good to happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im going to go with the years i spent studying for a criminology degree over your exp sorry i would like you to show me one source that dismisses all of the hindbrain processes in favor of behavior stemming from conscious controlled cognitive ability ive been studying this stuff for decades most of which in realworld applications college classes are good but they dont make experts except many of those are culturally coded and or culminations of more than just hind brain urges the cognitive functions primarily serve to make sense of the hindbrain activity to attempt to separate them out reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of psychology and neuroscience there are tons of women who find forearms to be really really hot when throwing a stickshift around its gotten me action before im not disagreeing with you i am saying that it isnt about the actual stickshifts except for maybe some women who might fetishize stickshifts for whatever reason but what the ability to thow around a stickshift implies about the man thats what is turning the women on not the stickshift in isolation i guarantee you that some milquetoast wimp isnt going to all of sudden have women throwing themselves at him just because he happens to know how to drive stick and this attractive dudes get easier action seems to directly contradicts this but there is no angelic perfection of chadliness that just makes women have sex because their teeny tiny little brains cant say no to their urges first you admit that attractive dudes are more likely to have sex with fewer strings attached but then you say that there isnt a level of attractiveness that makes women more likely to have sex with fewer strings attached so what all those women are looking at those attractive guys and making a rational decision to have sex based on the inherent logic even if sometimes that rationale contradicts other rationales they have for not jumping into bed with him i dont think anyone male or female approaches sex like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont want to convince you trp is set up to push people like you away your logic is extremely faulty do you really think that the comics back the logic or do you simply not understand how logicargumentsdebates work
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see how the linked article is much different from what ive argued women are interested primarily in mans looks and resources if shes single and wants casual sex she chooses strong handsome men as if she were going to procreate with them good genes looks and yes in such instances she wants sex with the local pump and dump badboy fucktoy because he exudes raw masculinity that her vagina and emotions responds to shes even to do so if she wants children she wants them with strong handsome men good genes looks if she has children with a man who is also her provider hes very likely a strong handsome man looks resources theres no reference to mans personality intelligence education or conversation skills that factors into her selection process or otherwise its a minor consideration
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lot of it is just fundamental rp principles taken to their most logical extremes while i agree that they can be taken to the extreme im not sure that is always logical for example the idea of alpha bux is pretty widespread in the rp community that right there contradicts the notion that no married woman is attracted to her husband however the tendency for bpers to dismiss concerns using equally ludicrous assertions like they arent divorced so they have a successful marriage or they seem happy or whatever probably provokes the attempt to make things more extreme kind of like how awalt was developed as a response to the dismissiveness of nawalt though i do think awalt is more accurate than swalt some women especially if you really understand what awalt includes which hardly anyone seems to anymore but i am also a great believer in apalt as well so maybe thats not surprising and i also think it is true that the men who are having casual sex on their terms tend to be in the upper echelon of men i consider myself even aboveaverage in a lot of ways at least i was when i was most sexually successful and that was a feat of daring even for aboveaverage me to accomplish one that often amazed my friends its just not that common most of the time i was having to work for that sort of thing or i was seriously slumming it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no its less useless to most people thats the problem it was my original statement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think what they mean is that alcohol removes inhibitions so once she gets drunk she knows she wants sex as much as the next person and quality doesnt matter as much because your judgement is affected so women do want sex too just that due to expectations and standards she set for herself not any guy will do while sober but when she is drunk it might not matter it is not the disgust so much as once you are drunk your filters disappear like when you get drunk at an office party and tell your boss what you really think of them you have held those views before and they are true but no filter means you wont be able to make a good judgement call in that specific context when a person gets drunk and has sex with someone they normally would not it means they are doing what they actually want to do but without the sober filters for quality she does want sex but after a few drinks she cares far less about looks and almost any penis will do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you also let your guard down more and are more pliablesusceptible to pressure one thing the rp fails to understand a lot of men have no idea what its like to be surrounded by constant sales pitches for sex when youre sober secure they have no appeal your immune system is good but when life deals you a blow your guard drops and then suddenly these guys attention is appealing she want to believe hes right that sex makes thing better she goes along with the fuck and then realizes she was right the first time not worth it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can tell you that be cool is distinct from be passive or be deferential or be her friend or be unassertive oh it definitely is distinct its interesting ive never really had to give this enough thought to put into words but now im trying its a bit difficult it is correct to say for me and maybe for women like me and your wife that be cool is specifically not about wanting men to be deferentialpassivesupplicating those traits arent a neutral theyre a negative in those opposite sex stranger interactions and its not like i dont feel for men in those situations rp sometimes talks about women as if were all just waiting salivating to destroy your selfesteem at the slightest misstep for me i always keep my disappointment hidden because im sensitive to ahow difficult it is to approach strangers and bi understand what a big deal male pride is and no part of me wants to damage a mans pride when hes done nothing more than try to talk to a woman but those interactions where he ends up not being cool nothing ever comes of them its a hard no when someone even someone very attractive fails to meet the cool bar and i feel weird using the cool word i dont mean it in the sense of him wearing trendy clothes or using appropriate slang i just mean it in terms of him being able to walk the line between passivedeferential and blowhardridiculously overaggressive parody of masculinity i want men to be able to give it back i want them to test me to throw conversational curveballs etc ive always been fine with the concept of negging but it has to be done right and its so easy to get wrong and thats important telling me my ass would look better in a different dress is kindergarten level stuff and will immediately make me feel sorry for the guy and feeling sorry for a guy is not a good thing for him this all sounds like its mysterious and impossible but some men are totally able to do this to interact naturally without being deferential or and sometimes i see the efforts men go to and where they go wrong and part of me just wants to pull them aside and give them a talk on where theyre hurting their own chances with women and hey all of this said nawalt i suppose im only speaking for myself there probably are some women who go for deferentialtotally unthreatening and maybe even more who go for ott attempts at immediate and total psychological domination and in this case dude better be sure he can actually bring it on that front the vast majority of them cant edit holy shit that was long sorry
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im never going to be comfortable with the redpillpua terminology but yes i understand what youre talking about now one last question how do you personally see the difference between a soft no and a no coming from a place of vulnerability the biggest criticism of your flag is that they do a terrible job distinguishing between the two and other people may pay the price
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope not by a long shot i simply dont believe that good terps just dont usually make much noise i suspect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know if ive learnt this yet but i think maybe you get better at flirting with trial and error i feel that im not bad at it now but certainly it was not something that came naturally to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would like you to show me one source that dismisses all of the hindbrain processes in favor of behavior stemming from conscious controlled cognitive ability ive been studying this stuff for decades most of which in realworld applications college classes are good but they dont make experts youve been reading freud then determinism isnt at all main stream anymore the cognitive functions primarily serve to make sense of the hindbrain activity to attempt to separate them out reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of psychology and neuroscience again determinism as for the rest of it you guys are misusing abstractions here chad is an abstraction this abstraction is for attractive dudes who score high on the lowest common denominator of sexiness but because of the emotional response to women in trp youve made it more than that men who get lots of easier sex exist but trp assumes that this abstraction demands that all women feed it they dont women who dont do casual sex arent gonna lay a chad women arent going to jump through the mental hoops trp says they do not awalt redpill ideology isnt bad because it is all wrong its bad because it takes these abstractions and uses them against women like the kkk uses abstractions again blacks its just way way waaaaay bigoted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,find me one single cmv post on the side of trp that doesnt use those dumb ass comics and argument in circular decorations or links to unsourced conjecture your side is the one asking me to accept my well sexed well loved and adventurous life is against the very paradigm of truthful sexual existence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,intelligence was one of the first things listed emotional stability and maturity was listed in two different categories you had your chance im done with you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,while i agree that they can be taken to the extreme im not sure that is always logical logical in that you just extend the premise to the farthest reaches it can extend not logical as in rational or reasonable for example the idea of alpha bux is pretty widespread in the rp community that right there contradicts the notion that no married woman is attracted to her husband i agree with you but youd be surprised how many terps have hand waved the idea away or high beta as if its so rare its the hypothetical male unicorn however the tendency for bpers to dismiss concerns using equally ludicrous assertions like they arent divorced so they have a successful marriage or they seem happy or whatever probably provokes the attempt to make things more extreme ok the first example is ridiculous as to the second i dont know why you cant say thats empirical evidence of happiness although if thats all youve got it doesnt close the door to unhappiness but no reason to not bring it up the rest of what you said is pretty agreeable to most of us reasonable folk hence me saying rpers like you are grounded but lets not pretend the extremists dont vomit those views all over ppd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she does want sex but after a few drinks she cares far less about looks and almost any penis will do right and thats not how we gauge actual attraction to someone that just sounds like sex for sexs sake or horniness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he just means youre one who is easy to talk to and who actually tries to understand differing perspectives instead of handwaving away any idea that even has a scent of questioning rp theory
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,determinism isnt at all main stream anymore im not talking determinism why you would immediately jump from psychology to philosophy is beyond me but you dont have to subscribe to philosophical notions of free will and determinism to understand the role of hindbrain functions like emotions and instincts in our behavior as a matter of fact behavioral economics is turning the idea of rational actors the basis for most economic theory on its head i would say that the idea that humans always act rationally because we have advanced cognitive functioning is the more antiquated paradigm again determinism no httpbigthinkcomexpertscornerdecisionsareemotionalnotlogicaltheneurosciencebehinddecisionmaking glad to see that you have such a solid grasp on what you claim to be the expert in chad is an abstraction i would say archetype but sure whatever this abstraction is for attractive dudes its for understanding what makes sexually successful dudes successful who score high on the lowest common denominator of sexiness i have no idea what this means but because of the emotional response to women in trp youve made it more than that nor can i make sense of this its made it what exactly and of course their is an emotional response to women unless you experience no emotions chances are most responses guys have with at least attractive women are emotionallybased but trp assumes that this abstraction demands that all women feed it wtf this sounds dramatic as hell ill give you that but i have no idea what you are trying to convey beyond that women who dont do casual sex arent gonna lay a chad right but ime most women who have been around a while seem to have at least one casual encounter in their sex life i think all of my female friends have and ive never had a sexual partner ever who didnt have sex with me almost immediately after hooking up women arent going to jump through the mental hoops trp says they do what mental hoops are you talking about and why would they be jumping through them not awalt so you think awalt says that all women have casual sex i think you better improve your sources of information please tell me you get that awalt isnt about stuff like casual sex or ltronly sex its bad because it takes these abstractions it takes what abstractions the idea of chad and uses them against women like the kkk uses abstractions again blacks trpers use the abstraction of chad against women how do they do that how can they even do that that makes no sense and just out of curiosity what abstractions does the kkk use and how do they use them against blacks im not seeing how anyone could use an abstraction against someone else
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your side is the one asking me to accept my well sexed well loved and adventurous life is against the very paradigm of truthful sexual existence nope we ask of nothing trp is set up to make you go away it doesnt want you to understand it doesnt want you to read it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree with you but youd be surprised how many terps have hand waved the idea away or high beta as if its so rare its the hypothetical male unicorn well i was one for at least a decade probably longer so i know that they exist i was living the marriage dream for a long time meaning i had a spouse that was from what i could tell very attracted to me right up until i wasnt to the larger point i feel that both sides are often reactive which means that they are more likely to make their positions more extreme i know that i am like that here i too get frustrated with the seemingly lack of acknowledgement of certain problems and issues and with the certainty with which some hold their views so i tend to become more inflammatory in an attempt to break up that pattern the awalt response to nawalt as it were
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i am not arguing attraction we are talking about how alcohol affects your judgement and removes filters women get horny too a few drinks will remove some filters that sober her would still have when she is horny but sober she might still have standards that no man can meet and head home alone drunk her may not be as picky the issue i think is that the standards women set themselves for attraction are higher and more complicated than those for men a drunk guy would probably when sober regret sex with an unattractive woman but would still appreciate getting laid a drunk woman when sober would regret it and not really care that she got laid she would prefer no sex to sleeping with an unattractive guy as opposed to a man who would prefer sex with an unattractive woman to no sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair enough i just dont like being held up as some noble model of good rp there is no such thing as good or bad rp there is rp and then there are individuals applying rp how any individual applies rp is subject to moral interpretation but even then its still in the eye of the beholder as to which way any particular action falls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not talking determinism why you would immediately jump from psychology to philosophy is beyond me but you dont have to subscribe to philosophical notions of free will and determinism to understand the role of hindbrain functions like emotions and instincts in our behavior as a matter of fact behavioral economics is turning the idea of rational actors the basis for most economic theory on its head i would say that the idea that humans always act rationally because we have advanced cognitive functioning is the more antiquated paradigm oh ffs read up on orectic psychological determinism so i dont have to explain it thats redpills stance here emotional vs rational has nothing to do with what we are talking about sexatron single input hedonistic fembots are do i really have to fight angry blogspam here no neuroscience glad to see that you have such a solid grasp on what you claim to be the expert in reading angry sexual failures pissing over the internet didnt make you as knowledgeable as you think i have no idea what this means attraction is not universal or all genetic bad evopsych is bad unless you experience no emotions chances are most responses guys have with at least attractive women are emotionallybased being angry illogical misogynists isnt excused by emotional responses wtf this sounds dramatic as hell ill give you that but i have no idea what you are trying to convey beyond that the red pill as practiced and preached by trp on reddit is human biodiversity for dating right but ime most women who have been around a while seem to have at least one casual encounter in their sex life i think all of my female friends have and ive never had a sexual partner ever who didnt have sex with me almost immediately after hooking up holy anacdotes batman im sure youve bed ever woman ever sure lots of women have sex fast to the horror of redpill not all do so you think awalt says that all women have casual sex i think you better improve your sources of information awalt means all women have the drive for evil hypergamy cheating and sweet alpha chads its an excuse there are the parts of a healthy world view and realisation in there but its too lost in the abstraction game too much is buried under the guide
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the thing is its hard to have abundance mentality when your whole life youve been ignored mocked and rejected repeatedly by the opposite sex early success breeds that natural confidence which breeds abundance mentality but it also works backwards constant rejection and abuse can really do wonders to ones selfesteem creating a negative feedback loop that feeds unto itself and once someone is caught up in that cycle it can difficult to break out of it especially when that person receives no support and continues to go through rejection mockery and abuse i understand the importance of abundance mentality but a chronically rejected incel cant just wake up one day and decide im going to stop being desperate and adopt abundance mentalityit just doesnt work that way the thing about abundance mentality is its so much easier to adopt it when youve at least experience some level of success when you know you can attract someone and its just a matter of better handling those situations but when no one has ever wanted to fuck youits just hard for me to imagine a sexual loser suddenly trying to be like he has options but is just choosing not to pursue them abundance mentality is not an onoff switch in order to properly adopt it you have to really not be desperate and part of not being desperate is knowing that youre able to attract the opposite sex if this is not the casethat person is going to be having a difficult time adopting abundance mentality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,scratch the word mentality from the end of your title and the statement becomes a lot more accurate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incels are stuck not because they lack abundance mentality but because they lack the necessary looks to even get a below average girl to sleep with them of course they are desperate they cant get any so they fall into despair women arent rejecting them because they are desperate theyre rejecting them because they are turned off by their physical looks and its hard for men to have an abundance mentality when its hard for most of them to get laid let alone a guy with below average looks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a true bro will pay a callgirl to feign interest in his incel buddy and get him laid then again most incels suck at having friends too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i find the biggest flaw in your argument is in the main goal for a man to put in all the effort time and money to get a women is to have sex with her this isnt unique to incels ever if it is true which its not i fail to see how this ties to your abundance mentality no matter how abundant men think you hour chances with women are it doesnt change the fact that the whole point men interact with women in the first place is to get intimate with them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which is why rp advises fake it till you make it yes also go out there and really get abundant at something and in addition for the time being an incel should take it till they make it theres always one impressionable girl thats an easy lay out there numbers game
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im getting a mixed message for this post incels come across needy for sex but they are doormats who dont act sexual
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think a big part of it is self hatred incels cannot accept that anyone is attracted to them so when someone is they ignore it or assume that the person has something wrong with them plus inability to be intimate with someone abuse victims people with overbearing parents etc sometimes sabotage potential relationships due to intimacy fears ugly people get laid and have relationships too not the same quality of partners but they do it it sucks that incels always default to thinking they are ugly ugly people who are emotionally healthy and have social networks can have dates sex and relationships not as much as high smv people though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres not just one thing that stops a guy from getting action theres all sorts of things cleanliness style needs to at least look like a grown up raw physical attractiveness might need to work out a bit if he looks deathly thin or diet if hes huge not fighting a battle he can win if hes extremely inexperienced and actually wants to get laid if his ego can allow it he needs to hit on lower quality people fatter uglier worse style etc if he just walks up to hot women that the most successful handsome and charismatic men also hit on hell never get laid after he becomes more of a grown up and better at meeting new people he can up who he talks to just a total lack of social skill and the root cause of it probably changes from person to person its a combination of low selfesteem no experience to guide future action no mentors to help him out of it etc being a loser overall in a sense this means not valuing himself legitimately remember that low selfesteem his weird pretentiousness is an overcompensation and ironically shows that same low selfesteem again this just colors all aspects of how he presents himself from sometimes being oddly cautious and permissionseeking to allowing people to take advantage of him to being overly into someone the thing is no one is into someone that fast he doesnt even know the other person it gives off a totally disingenuous and dangerous vibe when someone is basically manic over a new friendshipromantic opportunity the key is to go at the right pace and that takes selfesteem and experience there are no substitutes its natural for inexperience to breed this sort of elementary school style love the person dealing with it just needs to rely on his logical side he should ask do i have any real reasons to feel this way have we even held hands yet have we kissed yet see feeling super lovey dovey with someone should only ever come after reciprocation thats when a relationship becomes thrilling but to this inexperience chump the mere act of giving the time of day feels like reciprocation because he never even gets that since hes so antisocial he needs a very strong reality check and to compensate for this natural tendency in people new to dating having similar traits to a narcissist narcissism is a point on a sliding scale call it clinical narcissism on the left and normal on the right everyone has some bad traits from narcissistic personality disorder but people without a sense of directionidentity have such flat egos that they tend to be closer to clinical if not fully clinical than the majority of people there needs to be some major epiphanies to get away from this since a large component in the disorder is delusion hallmarks are blaming others not truly being interested in other people or their perspectives weirdly stiff pretentiousnesshaving an extreme sense of importance that isnt justified having no core identity denial of responsibility unhealthy fantasies and no behavior to pursue it and trying to manipulate others
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gavinok i think youre right with a lot of men i certainly know people this would apply to perfectly however i think its only for people who have other attractive qualities already and just need to up their game if an incel doesnt have much value even when hes confident weak short ugly boring no skills no money adopting positive thinking isnt going to help them very much if they leap right into the sexual market place without doing some self improvement first otherwise theyre setting the odds against their success and will experience more failure which will feed into the negative self image of an already fragile ego its like if im a good athlete positive thinking is going to help me race for sure lotta thats mental but if i never run or train and i jump right into a with optimism im still going to fail miserably tldr i think this only works if the incel is already puissant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how can you create an abundance mentality when you know rationally you are too unattractive to be picky apart from being delusional
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fake it till you make it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incel here never even kissed a woman can women sense my mentality probably i feel like ending it most days no idea how to interact with women and yeah i admit im uncomfortable acting sexually why wouldnt i be zero experience ugliness social anxiety are a potent combo dont have any friends either and im not a doormat im too useless to even be that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this applies only if we assume the incel is also an omega with whack social skills terrible looks depressing mentality and fixedmindset outlook on the world and his own potential an incel with a strong drive to change the world will at the very least find any kind of way to solve his problem even if this entails hitting the gym honing all manner of social skills and then dating women several smv points lower than what he should be able to get thus i argue that lack of abundance mentality usually isnt their only or even their primary weakness edit grammar
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they also do very weird things and say weird things i wish someone would tell them hey bud stop using facebook as a personal diary
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when these guys are obsessed with sex and their lack of it that desperation stains everything they do and think like a dog drooling all over everything to break out of this cycle is hugely challenging but its something only they can do sex wont cure this if they were to suddenly get a gf it would likely be really tough because they are still needy and desperate even tho they are fucking someone needy and desperate is always woman repellant and its absolutely within the power of an individual to become less needy and desperate if they really want to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are taking a huge bet first that the incel walks into a bar or a club in the first place they never really make it out of their front door most of the true incel types i have met have a combination of problems first terrible selfesteem and no functioning ego just an id and part of a superego they were never taught self esteem or it was damaged from other traumas in their life they were taught that the world is a way that it probably never even was
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my husband was an obese nerdy not in a good way short immigrant asian teenager with bad hygiene and bad teeth and terrible social skills he even wore glasses years out of style to show he was serious and not like other people i had three deadserious marriage proposals before we met two were from a bank manager and a mechanical engineering grad student when we met my measurements were and i hated going swimming because i would always get a flock of men around me no matter what swimsuit i wore im not saying all men loved me but plenty did a lot did it made lots of things like job interviews supremely awkward i was also a straight a engineering student i married him why because by the time we met he was a lean guy who made an effort socially he wasnt creep in his behaviorthough to be honest still a little oddand had good hygiene he ran and lifted like i did we shared a hobby and a sense of humor he was a good student like me too and had life goals he was fun to be around and interesting to talk to still is years later still married heartbreakingly gorgeous mixed kids hes making and as a business owner so am i i still get hit on even in the grocery store btw and men come up to me in parking lots to compliment me and im a lighter than when we married he always looks to improve himself thats damn sexy in a man no dadbod here no slow decline into old age because why try he does still have terrible teeth but his glasses are cool and im not perfect either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is exactly my point its like why a lot of poor people stay poor they never had any earned success and dont believe its going to work out for them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well it has to be a mentality because its all about what reflects on your body languageconfidenceapproach if fucking a few girls doesnt make you feel like you have options it doesnt solve the problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,meh not really i know several guys who interact quite well with women but cant get laid even if they lower their standards really incel men are guys who have below average looks thats about it there is no real secret to interacting to girls confidence is just a myth women use to explain why they shut down guys if a guy is hot whatever he says is charming and full of swag but if hes not hot hes just wasting tim
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even people who enjoy relative success can suffer from lack of abundance mentality how often do we hear stories of young people killing their partners for leaving themcheating plenty those people go apeshit when theyre dumpedrejected
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women arent rejecting them because they are desperate theyre rejecting them because they are turned off by their physical looks and its hard for men to have an abundance mentality when its hard for most of them to get laid let alone a guy with below average looks it doesnt work like that females have certain vibes about guys and they dont have sexy vibes from every muscular guy they see in the gym for example
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dude thats some tyrionjaime shit just waiting to happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a true bro doesnt lie to his bro the end result of that maneuver would make the person feel even worse breaches trust of someone he thought he could trust and has his wildest hopes and dreams dashed as he realizes angel didnt really care about his warhammer figurine collection doing this would be like hitting someone while theyre already down i assumed this wasnt a joke even though its funny and made me laugh because its not posted on the automod so im responding seriously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i saw that episode of the big bang theory too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they lose their friends because they are grossly inappropriate when women are around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the main goal for a man to put in all the effort time and money to get a women is to have sex with her this isnt unique to incels ever if it is true which its not i fail to see how this ties to your abundance mentality the difference is you can put in effort time money etc but having abundance mentality says you dont give a fuck if you get rejected because you feel that there are other girls waiting to fuck you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,impressionable girls are impressed by alpha males they arent impressed by average looking incels who are trying to appear confident
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i want to add that prostitution can also help here by staving off thirstitll probably be easier for a reforming incel to improve knowing that can easily bang an with just a phone call and cash payment awayit may not help improve social skills but it will help keeping a dudes libido and mentality balanced as he strives to make himself into a more attractive man who wouldnt have to pay for sex in order to have sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres always one impressionable girl thats an easy lay out there lol no there isnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah its not like guys are going to introduce the incel to girls theyre either trying to get those girls themselves or they are orbiters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not random quite a few posters of foreveralone and the like suffer from depression
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and the difference between incels and poor people is that a significant part of the population believes that its unfair and bad for society that poor people are poor this part of society believes poverty is both the cause and effect of much injustice so a large portion of resources are diverted to poor people the money food and housing are simply given to them not so with incels because our society doesnt believe sexual success has anything to do with fairness or justice in fact most of society believes that if you are incel that is fair and just
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incels come across needy for sex but they are doormats who dont act sexual being needy for sex means you feel if you dont get sex you will be upset unhappy and disappointed incels often try to counteract this approach by compensating expressing their sexual interests in a girl by acting overly nice to her they are trying to feel the gratitude and graciousness they offer a girl compensates
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a popular way of thinking about incels but being aware of it and trying not to fit that stereotype is what landed me all of my biggest romantic and sexual burns because every time a girl appeared to be attracted to me they either werent or had ulterior motives so really how prevalent is this kind of overthinking i personally would wager that not very
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tldr incels are worse than hitler
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly its never one thing on a guy that gets him laid its a combination of everything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i still cant believe youre in monk mode you should be in a classroom teaching the other celibates voluntary and otherwise
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what a stupid thread how can an incel have an abundance mentality its like saying the problem with poor people is the fact they dont have any money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they just need to find weird girls to match up with p
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive known people in relationships who do that too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,consider that back years ago they would be taught to die to self along with the rest of the bible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you didnt marry him because he worked his ass off to be an attractive man you married him because he was an attractive man the conclusion here is that its not the effort that matters its the result sometimes people work just as hard if not harder than your husband to be attracted but health problems shitty genes poverty whatever fuck them over in the end and they dont get the same great result as your man did
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what does this have to do with whether a man is incel because he has no abundance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i believe i will get a million dollars today isnt going to help a poor becoming rich is it if thats abundance mentality only a rich banker or his grandson bill gates can afford to have it people are poor because their parents didnt give them a small loan of a million dollars to start its not because they like it i assure you earned success happens to a very few chosen lucky sobs yes luck not hard work nobody got rich ever only from hard work edit typo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which is why i think women giving advice to men is retarded just be your best self keep approaching girls hey mr trump how do i become a rich business man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whether someone believes success is possible only becomes relevant if success is indeed possible the problem of a hardcore incel isnt that its that success is indeed not possible for him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if hes having sex and still has confidence issues thats a different problem from being incel and stuck as a year old incel i will never have abundance mentality because i have never and will never have abundance but i sure as hell wont be incel if i ever find someone willing to have sex with me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive seen texts and ims where no matter how a hot guy acts women will find a way to spin it positively
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,too simple to blame that all on abundance mentality gotta remember one true loveoneitis dependency on femalemale validation fear of being alone so on and so forth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you are gross and disgusting and the most confident man in the world most girls are still going to find your confidence as creepy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,an incel isnt incel because all girls like some particular type of guy that doesnt look like him an incel is incel because there is no girl out there who likes someone who looks like him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lord tywin did nothing wrong he only tried to impart some harsh truths to his progeny and how do they repay him incest and an arrow to the gut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a true bro doesnt lie to his bro the end result of that maneuver would make the person feel even worse only if he finds out his friend can still fake it until the other guy makes it ie before you drop that bomb on him you wait until he managed to get some success on his own odds are that bdtbs plan wont work out though because the incel will fuck things up with the callgirl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you still havent really answered the question how does main sense of satisfaction in having sex relate to abundance mentality whether you know for a fact there are other girls waiting to fuck you or that you have only one shot at sex fucking a women is still the main sense of satisfaction a women can give you also abundance mentality and the idgaf mentality are only marginally related even if you do have other opportunities for sex you still have to work for it get rejected sucks not because you think that was your only shot at sex ever although that might play a minor part but because all the effort time and money you spent of the women basically went down the drain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but there arent lol if a guy needs to put in the effort time and money into it and still despite all of that doesnt get laid there is no point in having abundance mentality because no matter how many women there are out there who are ready to fuck they arent ready to fuck the guy who has to put in effort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i want to add that prostitution can also help here by staving off thirstitll probably be easier for a reforming incel to improve knowing that can easily bang an with just a phone call and cash payment away i think at the base level using the prostitute gives the man the idea that he is not dependent on a girl not rejecting him for sex it gives some base level of abundance mentality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,damn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,damn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well theres always fat girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some of us have tried hooking incels up they make us regret it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yah but depression is the symptom not the cause anyone who hasnt had friends in like years and never datedhave a social life is going to develop depression generalization
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,quite a few men suffer from depression they still get laid incels are men with below average looks theyre probably so below average that not even below average women want to sleep with them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why should sexual success have anything to do with fairness or justice when you are talking competing with members of the same sex im asking honestly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incels often go from i believe in fairy tales to id be happy if any girl sexed me to fuck those disgusting sluts all of which are guaranteed to make almost any girl feel like shes committing statutory rape shes the piece of meat with the power of pity insects are crawling all over him none of them are healthy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they think women are vending machines put nice in get sex out as long as you think that no one will have you except a prostitute
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my point is that if you take the average incel who thinks they are incel because they think they are ugly you can find someone who is uglier who has gotten dates and relationships so the lack of sex appeal plays a role but it cant be the only factor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have you spent much time chatting with women online not in a long time do you practice talking to women at stores no unless you mean the cashiers too self conscious what books have you read about charisma none
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha thanks ive tried helping my incel friends in the past but a fixedmindset creates a selffulfilling prophecy which creates a negative feedback loop which entrenches the fixedmindset and on and on so they rather just stay still within a mental iron maiden created from shameful childhood experiences among other events too bad only the dead sit still so in life it manifests as depressing comfort that not even the biweekly dd session cant keep in tow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,obviously both of those being cases where the cause and the effect have been mislabeled for some reason cant imagine what reason nope cant imagine but since were on this consider that panhandlers tend to receive more coins in their hat if theyre better dressed this same set of feedback loops is also the reason why its damn near impossible to get effective or honest policy in the united states with regards to poverty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thank goodness for the unfollow button seriously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what i was thinking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,many entrepreneurs are self made today people get rich from smart work not hard work you dont get rich working hard as a coal miner
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,earned success happens to a very few chosen lucky sobs yes luck not hard work nobody got rich ever only from hard work i strongly disagree because you used the word lucky hard work by itself wont get you anywhere but it is one of the requirements its just like a car with a powerful engine wont get you anywhere if it doesnt have everything else it needs to actually get somewhere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you keep approaching girls like a loser you will keep striking out girls know when all you really care about is sex its super obvious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why is it not possible though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,prostitutes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre probably right most people who are dumpedrejected dont go murdering people as a result i guess you have to already be special breed of whack to actually get to that level im just pointing out that lack of abundance mentality can also affect people who you wouldnt think would go apeshit its understandable why the ugly incel goes on a rampage but when we see the good looking quarterbacks face in the news for murder charges people think oh my what went wrong with this promising young man hell its not just men notorious cases of rejected females killing their partners have become increasingly common
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,still sounds like a lack of abundancesomeone whos a healthy abundance mindset should not develop onetrueloveoneitisfear of being alone etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all of those keep you in a relationship longer though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if only better than average looking men were successful with women no one less than average looking would be in a relationship or married etc and yet they are all over the world average to ugly people are hooking up with each right now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah keep telling yourself its all about your looks you know better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah raping your disabled son by proxy in the books and emphasising that nobody will ever love him is a sure way to end up with mentally welladjusted kin who will in no way turn against you good job tywin dad of the year
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its way too high risk low reward to do this underhanded method i have had more success bringing these men along with me to the gym helping them out with mental belief restructuring emotional release and setting them up with a girl that takes more effort than calling up an escort but its far more likely to succeed simpler and can be done on a trustworthy basis of honor honesty and mentoring
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they arent ready to fuck the guy who has to put in effort your confusing effort with trying hard all women nearly all woman expect a man to go after her and desire her and make the sexual advances this doesnt mean you need to put in a lot of effort passivity is a female trait
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have been saying this for years a man with his balls being drained into a cute nice escort once a week is going to have a different attitude theres no way around that no it isnt attracting the girl yourself but i think its a step towards it with the right mentality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like i said it staves off thirst that male sex drive that causes do much frustrationit may or may not exactly improve a mans game with civvie women if a man is socially awkward seeing a prostitute will not necessarily make him less socially awkward around women but if anything it may get him more comfortable interacting around women since hes now been with them under the sheets and thus is no longer nervous around women or mystified by them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whoo boy you sure know nothing anout incels and the sexual market
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,explain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep ive been on both ends of that scenario but thats the whole point of trp you cant make women attractive to someone who isnt attractive no matter how much game you have
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it can be both people who suffer from depression arent going to find it easy to make friends
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incels are men with below average looks theyre probably so below average that not even below average women want to sleep with them not always the case i have seen some good looking guys who had religious controlling catholic parents which fucked up their sexuality big time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not always im an incel and i made out with a really hot girl not too long ago she said i was incredibly attractive and she had all sorts of fantasies about doing all sorts of things with me but she still wasnt interested in pursuing it further because of my mental state personality and lack of status thats why i get kind of annoyed when the guys on foreveralone say its all because theyre ugly often its very little about looks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in other words go kill yourself faggot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it doesnt i was responding to the comparison above between incels and poor people and reciting what the difference is and how society treats each group differently based on what our society has concluded is important and unimportant query whether human touch and human connection are important to people but thats another comment but in any event our society has made a judgment call in our societys judgment the plight of incels is decidedly less important than the misfortunes of poor people the problems of the poor are addressed the problems of incels are not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its obviously not the only factor but its the ultimate factor sure sometimes very physically repulsive people will be successful because of redeeming features like charisma but thats just a very unlikely combination being so ugly as to be unlovable is already an unlikely set of traits that plus such charisma as to override the ugliness and make the person attractive again is even less likely to assume that every incel out that has those kinds of hidden depths is just silly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,👆👆👆
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i tend to be more of the voltaire school of thought smart as it is often used translates well as clever an old term which used to indicate a conartist until very very recently but yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats why i wrote only of course earned implies hard work for most of us other means dont quite get the earned feel more likely cheating anyway i think there are other requirements otherwise coal miners could be the richest guys on earth but i digress
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,everyones reasons are different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if theyve been brought up in a heavy conservative evangelical judeochristian culture then they may well have the skew against prostitutes deeply ingrained gk chesterton described how he experienced my own despicableness when he paid for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i choose not to for my own reasons but yeah prostitutes are available to me maybe if i did use their services it wouldve given me abundance mentality back when i was making huge buck but well im in russia and with the new cold war and stuff theres much less money to go around my job market specifically took a very bad hit and while not poor by any measure the financial strain from using a hookers services regularly would strain me financially way too much so poof goes the abundance mentality even if i did develop it from going to prostitutes no abundance no mentality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what are you a nike commercial
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no all murders are down men and femaleseh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,should not still do its the old hopeless romantic trick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,abundance mentality doesnt really protect from dependence in a relationship with another person dependence is a hugely complex element of human interaction thats always going to be there in some way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not one id want to be in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i disagree most average to ugly women who hook up arent hooking up with average to ugly men most average to ugly women who hook up are hooking up with above average men most average to ugly men are getting nothing no hookups no sex no dating no attention no play edit if it were true that average to ugly men were finding any women to hook up withhave sex withhave relationships with there would be no manosphere and no the red pill subreddit the red pill concept wouldnt exist the red pill would vanish tomorrow if average to ugly women started doling out sex to average to ugly men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah incels are pretty damn rare whats your point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not all about looks but a mans physical appearance is important much more important than most women let on sexual attraction has to be there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,solid argument right there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he did good not his fault his kids couldnt absorb his wisdom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pretty risky and dangerous statement imo passivity is commonly agreed to be an overall negative attributebehaviour it doesnt lead to success labelling it as female attribute is absolutist and oversimplifying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a cut escort once a week racks up a pretty huge monthly sum
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a bit difficult even going down that path if you internalise paul or proverbs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well you did kiss someone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never met a hot guy like you say you are who was a virgin im sorry but teenager girls dont give a shit about status and if you were as attractive as you say you are you would have lost your virginity in your teens or at least a girl would have given you a handjob at the very least
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how would society address the problems of incels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are many many examples of entrepreneurs who grew up poor or working class donald trump is not all entrepreneurs look up alan sugar felix dennis theo paphitis sheldon adelson howard schultz steve jobs oprah winfrey jayz cent and for that matter pretty much every single rapper ever in fact not only did they not grow up in a rich family with connections but many also have dyslexia or a similar disorder failed school httpwwwcollegedropoutshalloffamecom etc anyone can do that shit but only if they have the ambition to truly see it through the vast majority of people do not have this they have the ability but not the motivation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jan koum signed the billion dollar deal with facebook on the door of his old welfare office also you should define what you mean by wealthy and upper middle class these can range immensely based on location

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only of men are virgins otoh more than half of guys are and so are most women as freshmen in college redpillers are delusional thats all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but what about all those field reports about plates and you mean to tell me they arent really true kaboom mind blown
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that it isnt about looks its about having a toxic personality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in women its not seen as a negative trait in the dating market its accepted for women to expect men to make more of the moves and to come to them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you think a girlfriend who likes you is free
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,get over it thats self defeating and self limiting you can order a hotter girl than youll ever pick up on the phone like a pizza theres no such thing as an incel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or perhaps i wasnt particularly attractive in high school because i didnt know how to dress groom and hold myself properly and i didnt exercise not to mention i had no confidence no social skills and a pretty bad personality a major tenant of trp is that your attractiveness isnt some fixed genetic factor although it plays a part its heavily based on how well you take care of yourself and how you hold yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just about everything that could be done has been done though inadvertently the most important things have been done removing stigma from the unmarriednever married lifestyle and making porn virtually costfree widely available and mostly stigma free a fa can consume porn to his hearts content in his own home all he needs is a phone or laptop and an internet connection but porn is a bandaid it is feeding fas a steady diet of big macs and quarter pounders in lieu of the gourmet steak dinners deprived them but porn is better than nothing and so fas consume it relentlessly all that remains now is legalizing prostitution that would at least allow fas an occasional trip to the nice italian restaurant at the strip mall even if they dont get to eat gourmet

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know the future obviously but as it stands now i can hardly come up with a realistic scenario of even one woman being sexually attracted to me if you have any ideas on how sexual abundance might be possible for me in the future im all ears
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know the future obviously but as it stands now i can hardly come up with a realistic scenario of even one woman being sexually attracted to me if you have any ideas on how sexual abundance might be possible for me in the future im all ears
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think its pretty safe to say once youre pass
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,source lets take your claims as true if of men and up have had sex that doesnt mean they are getting hookups sex dates and attention it means that at least once of those men got someone to fuck them in roughly years or so of sexual awarenessadulthood the fact that roughly equal numbers of men and women have had sex by age doesnt mean that each of those women picked one of those men and had sex with them if you actually watch what women do and observe who they have sex with its pretty clear they have sex with the most attractive men they can get and thats not the average or ugly men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only of men are virgins wasnt it more like with being the percentage of virgins who have lost it by
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre making a lot of bad assumptions in there about reds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then people with toxic personalities would be incel but they arent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think its toxic personalities though sometimes it is but mental issues like depression and anxiety ugly dudes that are reasonably socially adjusted and competent usually have no issue finding relationships so long as theyre willing to accept they may not be able to get anything better than a fairly unattractive girl guys that never leave their bedroom because they get panic attacks from doing so are going to find it much harder even if theyre decent looking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so whats his secret
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course these trends exist on the american dating market and its even accepted as the should be norm by some but thats still a very far fetch from saying passiveness is a distinctively female trait
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know thats a cliche that of course terpers like to cling to because of their world view but its that very cliche i question as i said passivity is commonly agreed on to be negative for life success and labelling that behaviour as typically female is risky just look at where women stand in life today they go into college into university make careers in different fields become musicians politicians engage in various activities etc i dont see any more passivity when i look at the women of my generation than i see in men dating is a different subject but definitely not the only measurement of a persons activity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good point but still poor people who cant afford a cute escort every week are still having relationships and getting married
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no such thing as an incel he better not be poor and unattractive thoughthen he is screwed and not in a good way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you were fat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all your link says is that you are more likely to be rich if you are already rich no shit money makes money but it is false to act as if one cannot go from rags to riches its been done many times in the past and will be repeated many times in the future more than of funding for new businesses comes from personal savings and friends and family this does not indicate the friends and family are necessarily wealthy either by the way i could borrow £ from each one of my friends to buy stock to sell on id technically be part of that statistic but £ is not a large amount of money and does not require one to come from a wealthy background although charisma and confidence certainly help its the worst kept secret in the rap game that historically many rappers had to sell drugs in order to bankroll their rap careers selling drugs is a form of entrepreneurialism whats your point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is one of those stories that makes for a great anecdote and yet im really glad not to be the person telling it my parents are getting older and the prospect of dementia both terrifies and fascinates me howre you holding up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you actually watch what women do and observe who they have sex with mate i suggest you find yourself another hobby
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont have time to go into it but i did some statistical analysis on some cdc data several years ago i was a college student with a little time on my hands i dont work for the cdc and discovered that somewhere around of the current male population of the united states will die as virgins closer to if we count the expectations of those who will be born over the next generation given current trends the same was true for females but lagging behind males in the same trends by less than or i forget which while there are several forces which could counter this and reverse the trends the economic forces which caused it are politically supported and shielded and could very easily still be forcing masscelibacy until it caps out at around and at this point im spitballing a number which would be the atbirth expectancy for lifelong involuntary celibacy in both genders for all persons in the united states born after after this point everything switches from statistics to sociology
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well he has a great sense of humor about it all and his wife says he has a good heart too one worth ignoring looks and money for
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,poor ppl the us can afford cable internet and cellphones they can save up once every couple months for a escort give me a break
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no very skinny actually but it was more the social awkwardness and anxiety that held me back im talking extreme levels of anxiety nearly having panic attacks when i was in a difficult situation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then dont say things like never implying you do i dont on the other hand you shouldnt talk like you know what my thoughts and my living situation are and you actually did say those things dont ask me dumb questions about obvious things answer the question i posed to you as a year old incel who has done pretty much everything that is commonly advised to incels and who has found no success whatsoever can you come up with a realistic scenario that would lead to me not just having sex but having sexual abundance my bet is that no you cant i sure as hell cant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they can but theres definitely no way for them to catch up to normal people in terms of experience when it comes to relationships and sex its a very tiny minority of people that never have anyone by age out of those that do end up in that group only a tiny minority less than ends up changing that by age if youre going to say that all those people are lazy neckbeard shutins who dont develop that potential im going to ask you for solid proof of that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,heh observe is a pretty broad term applied here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,couple of things one man a trend does not make im skeptical that a woman is going to ignore looks and money for decades edit i found the original article in which the photo appears other facts this mans situation takes place in and arises from the nigerian sexual and relationship marketplaces which dont have much relevance to the west he had two kids by his first wife whom he divorced when she cheated on him with another man most likely for reasons we can all easily predict she found a better man better looking man man with more money she got a bigger better deal he has been with his current wife since only years he has kids with wife
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you make claims using your anecdotal evidence to back them up and i use my anecdotal obversations which built up my beliefs of the world i absolutely get where youre coming from the description of the male warrior nature and all the evopsych babble humans being nothing more than animals which have in their mind the survival of their species defending their pack against violent aggressors procreating to keep their race alive etcetera all i can say is my observations have been different passive to me means sitting and waiting stagnating around and dully watching the world take its turns while others the not passive ones become active and take things into their hands to succeed in life you cant remain passive if you want to make your dreams true whatever they might be being passive is not the best approach to do it often the worst one i dont see such a lifestyle from most women they go to university learn crafts and have jobs careers and fields of profession they cultivate hobbies friendships and relationships pretty much like men do to say that they dont actually want to do all of this because they would much rather be passive is a trp rationalization much like when somebody points at a woman who hasnt left her beta boyfriend terpers will say thats just because she hasnt met the right alpha stud but she would if she could as i have said before when seeking out partners on the american dating market there is indeed more passive behaviour by women at least reddit tells me so but that doesnt make it a female trait
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where i come from the poor people cant afford that hands you a break
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought poor people generally stole cable cell phones arent a luxury theyre a requirement to get a job
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just how expensive is internet in the us that cutting it off would free up a significant amount of money i mean my isps standard internet plan charges a monthly fee and only that smaller than an average persons daily groceries what the hell do they charge you in trumpland
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your view of this is oddly reminiscent of the blue pill as a whole look at my flair or the colour mentioned in my username your view is so defeatist if you go by this logic youd never bother attempting absolutely fucking anything i feel sorry for people who act like theyve already lost before they even begin you have a zero percent chance of achieving whatever your goal is be it getting girls or money or anything else if you never bother trying my own mother is not remotely famous but she grew up poor and her own family pretty much echoed the same bullshit youre saying youll never achieve anything no point even trying by net worth she is now a millionaire no support from absolutely fucking anyone the only difference between her and anyone else with a modicum of intelligence in their head is she actually had the balls to work for what she wanted instead of making excuses about how there is no point even trying felix dennis who was born poor and died with a fortune of £ agrees and he addressed the real reason most people are not rich it takes risk and thats scary and thats reflected in your comments right here pulling percentages out your ass and making excuses for why even making an attempt to do anything is pointless that same attitude is exactly why i detest incels theyre straight up pathetic i have zero respect for anyone who does not even try in life if you make no effort you deserve what you get which will be fuck all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes not from nigeria dude uganda hes from a culture where deformed children are still often murdered he married his current wife after they had six kids together her family was so opposed to they match that they hid it completely until she was pregnant and even then didnt legally marry for a while because of village opposition this is a society that still holds lots of beliefs about curses and witchcraft note that this means that he got women to marry him and he divorced one for infidelitywhich is incredibly common there hes been with wife since she was so years now since she was on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,poor ppl in the us dont have or look for jobs they have obamaphones section snap tanf and liheap no incels on reddit are undercaste stop being silly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,poor ppl in the us dont have or look for jobs they have obamaphones section snap tanf and liheap no incels on reddit are undercaste stop being silly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a low risk strategy is low reward a high risk strategy is high reward the bloopy view of life is stay low risk and just get by the red view is take those risks and become better than average thats where i fall on the issue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when have i gotten angry ive remained calm and rational throughout the debate and mentioned multiple high profile examples and one personal anecdote youre the one whos been getting angry anyway i do hope you stay consistent to your logic and never take any risks most women will probably reject you so never approach a single one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what reward would i get from that youre not even making sense at this point but again i assume you never approach women because most of them would reject you right thats consistent with your philosophy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have no problem approaching women then you are surely embarking on an endeavour in which you are statistically likely to fail the majority of the time the woman will reject you this is counter to your previous argument that there is no point in doing something with a high risk of failure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fat women or less attractive women are the equivalent of fast food to these types of guys
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men have lower standards than women because we have a dick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sometimes a guy has different tastes too like he might think this girl is super hot while everyone else thinks shes ugly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,would you agree that for heterosexual casual sex theres on average more demand from men for women than from women for men while thats not the case or at least not to nearly the same extent for relationships i dont think this can reasonably be disagreed with can it the obvious result is that a woman is in a better position and a man is in a worse position in the casual sex market compared to the positions theyd occupy in the more equal relationship market so for casual sex a woman can punch above her relationship league while a man has to settle for someone below his relationship league generally the only question remains is how much the casual sex market is skewed compared to the relationship one so the answer to your question is that they cant necessarily do better for casual sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,t e s t o s t e r o n e women will never understand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the same reason why people eat hamburgers instead of filet mignon
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because men are the sex that has to puts efforts into courting and pursuing relationships with women for example it is and i do not want to go to the gym at all i am lying in bed thinking about how i should but at the same time making excuses for not getting up and going it takes effort and discipline to overcome that moment in those situations the reward seems pretty small relative to the amount of effort you feel you have to put in imagine the same feeling its friday night you are tired after a long week and now you want to call up megan whos a however you realize that you have to take her out and entertain after all that you still have to pray that you get laid tonight you remind yourself that despite her telling you how charming you are and how much she likes spending time with you the last dates werent very successful then you get a text message from samantha whos a a little too chunky for your usual tastes but she consistently initiates contact with you and feels like an easy lay samantha sounds pretty great right about now just as some days a guy will chose not to go to the gym and be lazy on friday he might answer samanthas messages be lazy and chose to low key get it in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because the ugly woman is immediately available and willing and the man is really horny at the time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if they can do better im assuming youre not a man or youd know no one bats not even attractive men sometimes you gotta swing at bad pitches to keep your average up if you know what im saying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would an attractive man have sex with an ugly woman if he can do better because sex isnt investment for us we dont feel like we lose nothing by having it ugly chicks are easier to pick up for a number of reasons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men arent hypergamous they dont only date up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its true that both genders would obviously go for the best ones if they had the pick though a womans threshold seems to be much higher than that of a guy shed rather go celibate than fuck a beta whereas a guy would be happy enough downgrading from an or right down to a if the sex was convenient men will at least deem a slightly overweight older plainlooking woman as at least fuckable whereas women will seal their vag shut with superglue before they even got near a beta
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,alcohol boredom horniness ease of access
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,possibly better sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its all pink and she was the best at the time and it was as much effort as he was willing to put into getting his dick wet thinner girls have bigger demands did you get your man grabbing some ham hocks or were you the ham hock he grabbed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe hes just feeling lazy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because is still more than
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,cause he gotta bust
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because its easy and a lot of men are too busy or have better things to do than jump through hopes of fire
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id rather bang an uglier woman into weird stuff vs a hotter woman only interested in missionary with the lights off
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are a lot more variables to consider besides simple attractiveness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you want to be happy for the rest of your life dont make a pretty woman your wife
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,easy feels good good deed for the day whats not to like about banging an undesirable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because he can do both
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because men mostly dont care who they have sex with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think it would depend on his sex drive some men are super sexual and just like women these types have very little criteria aside from basics like youngish and thinnish the guys who would fuck anything and are attractive enough to do just that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,stop trolling
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its easy any port in a storm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,models are boring all beautiful women look alike each ugly women is ugly in all her own personal way that said fatties are nogo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly just because they can have wagyu filet mignon six nights a week doesnt mean they wont tear into a big mac when they are hungry and the filet is unavailable women absolutely refuse to believe that men arent just women with cocks our brains are different and our sexuality is different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah average men if you have models in your face all day what sense would it make to stoop lower xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all men dont share lower standards only desperate men will bang anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,doesnt matter op simply wants to argue her responses are better hamstering than a whore with a heart of gold
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes thank you people can be attracted to different traits and qualities
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure if he was depressed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly mila kunis does nothing for me but id fuck the jimchrist out of gwendoline christieespecially in her brienne outfit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or maybe the people judging her are just bitters who cant get laid so they downgrade her attractiveness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you really think a hot man cant find hot women to have sex with really
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but i bet if gordon ramsay and chef scott rolled into their house with lobster and risotto and caviar they wouldnt eat hamburgers no more if you wanna make that analogy thats what ballers have big booties big titties insta models actresses strippers and all the above
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plenty would argue that a good quality hamburger is almost as good as filet mignon
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres some misconception that all require a lot more work to have sex and theyre all gold diggersuse guys for dinners this is false if a guy is hot enough a will sleep with him without the wining and dining i have seen it happen if youre hot enough and can prove to her youre good in bed she will be back
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if hes attractive he should have a fbuddy or two that he can call up instead of having sex with an ugly or go online or just not bother sleeping with the ugly people act as if attractive men dont have standards maybe if they really dont have standards theyre not as attractive as you think they are im assuming you think since im not a man that i have never known any men who have casual sex and that i dont have eyes ive seen some of the people attractive men had casual sex with theyre rarely ugly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you seriously think attractive athletes struggle to find women on their own level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for the same reason a dog licks his balls because he can
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if trpers constantly complain that average guys cant get laid and that attractive guys have to fuck ugly chicks all the time isnt this just more proof that they are simply bad at estimating other guys smv and dont know what women want
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpwwwxojanecomsexilookalotlikelenadunhamandivebangedsuperhotdudes httpwwwxojanecomsexhithereimfatfortysingleandslutty httpwwwalternetorgsexamprelationshipsimveryfatandistillgetlaidalltimeshocked
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive honestly seen the opposite far more commonly irl relatively unattractive men with women who are hotter than them probably because women also judge sexual attractiveness more on personality compared to men of course theres also the more cynical hes probably rich explanation but i see it so often and rich people are pretty rare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do these overweight plain looking women ever get married then if theyre so repulsed by men who look similar to them cmon
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if a guy is so drunk that he thinks an ugly woman is good looking then its also likely that he will have whiskey dick and wont be able to get it up for the ugly anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gross go talk to your obese aunt and thin uncle nice extended family you have
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wow or maybe he just thinks shes attractive regardless of her looks were talking about attraction not general beauty right also for casual sex an ugly woman might be way more attractive than a hot one not even a hot girl thats horny beats an ugly nothorny woman once shes attractive why is this so strange to you op i mean the best that can happen to you is for you to fuck someone you want to fuck and to be fucked by someone you want to be fucked by thats all there is to it beauty and hotness are great but not relevant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its the modern age there are hot women who make it pretty easy to bang them lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never had trouble with guys staying with me and i dont do weird sexual shit lol i feel bad for ugly girls who have to do anal every week and all kinds of sick shit to make guys into them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,word i fucked an last friday and she was way less fun than the chubby girl from the week before
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youngish and thinnish would probably be at least average not ugly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,online dating has made it very easy to find better looking women to have sex with theres no excuse for a good looking man to have sex with a woman beneath him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,many men are speaking from places of desperation the average man refuses to believe that the hottest men dont have trouble finding hot women solpipsdsiipism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you think that michelin star chefs have never eaten in n out most of the best looking guys dont have models in their face many still need to go out to get new fun pussy just like any man plus honestly most of them drink because nearly everyone outside of the very very most sociable alpha men and sociopaths feel a certain amount of social inhibition or consider this angle men like big tits right well for nearly all of human history before implants who had the really big hooters fatstocky chicks girls youd fuck but wouldnt date so i guess what im trying to say is ugly is subjective and on a sliding scale drinking happens and also your friends think its funny and forcibly encourage you to wrestle the hog and take the heavyweight belt from her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because its there duh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do you assume that female models are down to casually fucking an equal that easily female models can have any man they want theres gotta be more to the guy than just being pretty even if she is just looking for a lay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shit happens sometime you just fuck up all chads need a dedicated pussy coordinator otherwise sometimes ugly bitches come through
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you speak of this as a man when i see men who are physically perfect fuck chicks for a night who arent really all that no being thin and looking like a woman does not make a chick a in this century where every chick is trying to masquerade as a landwhale sure but when you are in the proper social circles thin and feminine is average only desperate men will bang anything womens ignorance is adorable hugh grant the dude with the highest smv in the english cinema was caught fucking ugly prostitutes david beckham another dude with chad looks and wealth cheated on his wife one of the most popular spice girls members with prostitutes and the chicks werent even that appealing women really have no idea what men are like and what the life of a man is they think that men who lower their standards are desperate when pretty much every guy does it even the chads they build a religion around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not anything as low as trigglypuff but much of what is considered mildy unattractive in the msm is attractive enough for the run of the mill guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you clearly have never met men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are plenty of guys i know some hot some not its all pink is their mantra try not to warp this to fit whatever disney fantasy you got some guys fuck anything and some of them are hawt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,attraction is not the eye of the beholder its universal and besides women only complement their friends behind their back if theyre uglier than them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol whats next a guy who doesnt put every woman in the same league of a young angelina jolie is bitter and cant get laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your confusing find with availability a hot men can definitely find hot women to have sex with however there are other hot men also looking for hot women hot women have more options than hot menmen have a greater demand for sex over time thus an average girl will be more available than the hot girl and maybe more excited for the experience
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you really think a chad isnt going to take easy sex from a chick that doesnt look like jabba the hutt over having to work for sex with a hot girl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he can sometimes not always if a hot man wants to nut in the absence of hot women who want to fuck him he can choose between his hand and a notsohot woman a nut in the bush is worth two in the hand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in america filet mignon is available
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,excellent observation that goes with the old trope that fatties are better in bed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i know i am not saying it always requires more work i am using the example why someone might be in a situation where they ended up with someone less attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,s o l i p s i s m o l i p s i s m
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if hes attractive he should have a fbuddy or two that he can call up most women arent looking to be a fbuddy to a dude no matter how hot he might be even the blue pill chicks here will say that there have been chicks here who demanded their chads to make them their main girlfriend or theyd be dumped you dont think chads compete with other chads for women that by being a chad hes automatically given full access to hot women instead of having sex with an ugly or go online or just not bother sleeping with the ugly men have a much higher sex drive than women youre thinking this through over a female prism women want quality not quantity if they cant get laid with a chad its no biggie just pull out the dildo and go to dildo town men arent the same way men will take a chick that isnt hot she might be average or even ugly but theyll fuck her that also includes chads people act as if attractive men dont have standards maybe if they really dont have standards theyre not as attractive as you think they are you act like you have never met a chad thats sad im assuming you think since im not a man that i have never known any men who have casual sex and that i dont have eyes ive seen some of the people attractive men had casual sex with theyre rarely ugly show a picture of those socalled attractive men and women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the olympic village probably not in their hometown bars im sure they have even if they rarely do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,seriously i cant believe people think men like that have to have sex with ugly women the only reason they would do that is if they were a sex addict plenty of attractive men dont have sex addiction even then there is porn for that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but i know many attractive men that have standards even for casual sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sounds about right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some landwhale comic con nerd with acne and slitty eyes and smells like moldy cheese is average guy to them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women want chads feet tall with perfect faces and atheletic bodies why do you assume we have a bad time at estimating other guys smv
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,their brains is all the way messed up theyre so far up every womans ass creeping on their blogs and pages and shit that they infer from these select woman that every ugly woman is living it up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how many of the men are black or middle eastern is the secret question
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,super hot not sure about that one many women think the men theyve had sex or dated are better looking than they really are women will generously upgrade men as long as they like them or like banging them and this woman doesnt look like lena dunham shes exaggerating the other dont say the guys were super hot just that they get laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is that so it ever happened to you like a dude ever failed to get a boner with you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,speak for yourself i can lay pipe with a pretty good buzz unfortunatelyi used to have this bad habit and its very risky
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some guys dont have that problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one dont pick their family one respects their autonomy or acts a cunt to them i made my decision as have you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you really are from zomia
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are but they are few and far between supply and demand maybe a chad can find one of these hot and ready women on a given night and maybe not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like the implication that weird stuff must mean things that are physically painful for the girl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah hot women dont have to do all kinds of weird stupid things in bed to keep men interested doesnt mean theyre boring necessarily just means theyre not weird sex clowns
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lot of really got women are pretty lame in bed starfish fun freaky women come in all shapes and sizes if you only want to score a hottie to impress your friends you might be stuck with some boring sex if you find good chemistry you might value other things besides pure attractiveness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know ive seen people who meet those standards but are still ugly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tinder favors men but sites like okcupid and eharmony favor women so if a woman wants to have the advantage she should stay away from tinder because theres too much competition and the men arent as desperate there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they arent looking for an excuse and they dont care how you feel about it they just do it it doesnt affect them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,luckily we dont need to make excuses it happens and we dont judge unlike women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course the hottest men dont have trouble finding hot women most nights on nights when there are no available hot women to be found most guys will settle for warm women there are probably superchads out there who have enough tens lined up that they wont settle for a nine but that wasnt your initial premise you keep narrowing the goalposts attractive man to the hottest men for instance solpipsdsiipism do you have eplilpipelpsy or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are also attractive women who arent models you know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uhyeah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they are xd those hoes on instagram that yall see as unattainable angels theyll bust it wide open for ya boy maybe not runway models but
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do you assume that female models are some special breed of women who dont have sex drives and dont give into lust you think ugly women cant control themselves around an attractive man but attractive women can easily control themselves this makes no sense women of all types have sex drives being attractive and modeling actually makes a woman more likely to want sex more because shes getting a lot of validation for her body so she will usually be more comfortable being naked
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you fucking nailed it male models are like albino tigers in the wild females are commodities even if your status is even in terms of market value female models are sought after by everyone sports stars singers entertainers actors nerds finance moguls whatever you can fuck a female model as a male but you wont keep her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hugh grant is pretty weird looking i hope he does not have the highest smv in english cinema lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in this century where every chick is trying to masquerade as a landwhale i dont get this theres cellulite asses being celebrated everywhere and dont tell me they arent because everyone can pull poses and wear tights that hide it beyond that i agree sometimes an uglier woman just wants to fuck and is super happy to please yoou while a prettier one might be more interested in herself and what she can get out of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trigglypuff says she likes having sex so someone must have had sex with her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mildly unattractive xd wtf are you talking about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mildly unattractive so you mean average not ugly then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they seem to have no idea how men are but they like to make judgements on men getting casual sex is easy for any man only desperate men lower their standards most men wouldnt fuck most women etc its like watching a year old kid trying to take a ball from a year old kid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh since i know more about you now lets change it to hawt wealthy men wont fuck anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know what a slut is a woman who wont fuck you bitter men call women fat ugly sluts etc because they cant get with her the fact is if a person is with a hot partner they are probably hot too not many people want to fuck ugly people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you think hot women are all wound up tight and virginal and prude and wont be tempted to have sex with an attractive man get a grip
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah for what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i live in america no its not lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wtf no youve clearly never had a hamburger from a nice restaurant theyre very close to a good filet mignon
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have a friend that is a pro volleyball player top athlete and even he bangs fat and ugly girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gender myopia dudes will fuck a block of cheese if it there when they are horny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really chasing more like im sleeping alone and she has been hitting on me all evening ill probably bite
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or maybe i just know good looking men that have said they dont want to have sex with ugly women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,solipsism bitch
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rarely is the key here yall act like this is everyday shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yea mmhm all hot men go to their hometown bars and take roseanne home spot on because theyre going to do that instead of going home to jerk off or sext with their hot girlfriend or fwbs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly xd some dudes will stick it in anything and some end up dating these girls for their personality but dudes are not falling over themselves to smash an ugly chick these fools are all oohhhhh ugly women hav it so easy reeeeee bitch
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know many chads perfect face great hair clear skin atheletic build etc who showed me pictures of the girlfriends they had when they were younger and had low selfesteem or from when they didnt want to work to get laid with women as attractive as they were when i asked them what they were doing dating fatugly chicks they told me because it was easy and the girls looked the other way when they banged other girls you think hot girls cant be bitchy even to chads lots of chads dont want to deal with that shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do you know who any man is mudducking with are you with them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really this is average to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i hollered xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all ugly women are constantly getting banged by chad everywhere bathrooms behind buildings cars chad bangs every ugly he sees because he can what a world
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wait so are we so far up every womans ass or only aesthetically pleasing assholes belonging to pretty women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would that be a question
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,super hot not sure about that one many women think the men theyve had sex or dated are better looking than they really are women will generously upgrade men as long as they like them or like banging them because of hypergamy women will sleep with men who arent chad and then rationalize it to hes sweet and kind and listens to me talk about boring shit instead of saying fuck off i feel so attracted to him hes like a young orlando bloom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know any couples like this in real life im from a nice town not some backwards place in the south where of women are fat all of the people ive known and all their friends get married to people of similar attractiveness those pics seem to be rare cases
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well why is whiskey dick even a term its clearly a common happening
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if hes a real chad he will have a few girls he can fall back on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a freudian slip
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,cause ugly women cant be bad in bed lol i think people heavily insisting that hot women are always boring in bed might be sour grapes and cant just get hot women but who knows
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well maybe to you they are but the person having sex with them thinks theyre fine who knows not everyone overanalyzes looks you could pick out an ugly feature on almost anyone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well i would like to see some photos of all these attractive men and the awful looking women they seem to be constantly sleeping with would be interesting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure ill give you another example because a lot of people dont have tons of experience going out there are many times bars and clubs have zero and or at least none who arent in th vip area there are also times there are no girls better than a that arent with someone you can see how this gets exaggerated into i saw so and so last night and he fucked this ugly chick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what do you define as attractive on a scale of one to ten a is average would be above average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,available holes are available holes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,her ass looks like its a planet on its own not my thing at all but good on rappers for enjoying their lives id put a baby in her and pay childsupport out of my ass if i was a rapper or a worldclass athelete
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do you assume that female models are some special breed of women who dont have sex drives and dont give into lust shit i dunno maybe because i cant kick a fucking trash bin without hitting a model instead but attractive women can easily control themselves you think models see male models the same way as nonmodel girls see male models you know that these girls spend their entire time hanging out either at work or otuside of work with these dudes they dont have the the chads dick is so wonderful i got insta suck it effect because these men arent chad for them theyre just dudes in their league chicks dont go crazy for men in their league heres the thing there are male models and then there are male models averagelooking male model female models arent dropping their panties at the sight of that sort of guy they are getting drenched at the sight of this guy thats chad this makes no sense i just explained it to you there ya go being attractive and modeling actually makes a woman more likely to want sex more because shes getting a lot of validation for her body so she will usually be more comfortable being naked you think being naked means a woman is more comfortable with her body and more likely to want sex you realize theres a shit ton of girls in the fashion industry that have selfesteem so low they starve themselves to neardeath and end up in the hospital ill never understand why women like to talk about the things they have absolutely no idea about one of the most beautiful girls in the world a girl who worked as an escort for legit super rich men and who did nude modelling was also the girl with the lowest selfesteem i have ever met in my entire life she was so absolutely stunning with her ginger hair her dark brown eyes and her porcelain skin the chicks with the highest levels of selfesteem are the girls with no reason at all to have high selfesteem but because they are treated like goddesses due to pussy scarcity they think they are hot whereas beautiful women are pumped and dumped by fucbois and chads all the time they develop severe body issues and low selfesteem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being attractive and modeling actually makes a woman more likely to want sex more because shes getting a lot of validation for her body so she will usually be more comfortable being naked never dealt with models have you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you fucking nailed it male models are like albino tigers in the wild yep they are the male versions of helen of troy and women are all fighting each other to reach these guys the women who claim they arent doing it are only out of the race because they lack the smv to be noticed by the guys for even a random drunk fuck emale models are sought after by everyone sports stars singers entertainers actors nerds finance moguls whatever you can fuck a female model as a male but you wont keep her hahaha isnt it funny as fuck when female models will date a fat ugly fuck because he has money and connections but wont date a dude because hes a broke ass and plays video games when he isnt working smh bunch of golddiggers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there you go women have just confirmed their hypergamy is so high one of the most successful trouted actor as a sex symbol in the uk is considered pretty weird looking damn dude
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont get this theres cellulite asses being celebrated everywhere and dont tell me they arent because everyone can pull poses and wear tights that hide it most men are so thirsty that they are going to treat the fat chick like shes helen of troy the most beautiful and foughtfor women in the history of mankind its even funnier when girls with no ass pretend to have an ass huh no we can see the asss more plain than a pancake beyond that i agree sometimes an uglier woman just wants to fuck and is super happy to please yoou while a prettier one might be more interested in herself and what she can get out of it sure i suppose uglier women are happier to get attention any attention prettier girls are more concerned with the nail polish they just bought
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats disturbing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mildy unattractive means shes fat but she isnt so fat that she will break his dick in half
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what do you mean for ugly examples
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes he means mildy unattractive average women fatugly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yall dont know how women are either but youre constantly talking about us xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i remember you yourself saying that you watched your more attractive friends fuck good looking women in some other older comment now youre switching it k
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have a point the wealthier hawt guys i know granted small sample were more into escorts had one explain it to me as then i dont have to spend the rest of the night getting laid or hire one at for the cost now im chill for the remainder of the night i get you think you know men i guarantee you dont ive been one for years and sometimes other guys still surprise me but dont at the same time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know what a slut is a woman who wont fuck you no a woman who wont fuck me is a potential girlfriend the chicks i fucked were all sluts bitter men call women fat ugly sluts etc because they cant get with her i never saw how calling a woman a slut is an insult i see it as a compliment she likes sex and she likes it with lots of guys and if i get to fuck a slut chances are i am as good or nearly as good as the chads who fucked her because if i wasnt of high quality why would she fuck me in the first place the fact is if a person is with a hot partner they are probably hot too nah ive dated im not therefore i am not hot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh yes hot women keep themselves virginals so that one day they can get married men dont marry nonvirgins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are saying tastier is more costly think about that and let that sink in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you a fatty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,by fat do you mean over pounds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe his face is really ugly men always assume that hot body attractive not always pm me his pic and some of these terrible uglies hes banged d
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,read my comment chasing yall act like men are chasing these woman dont nobody give a fuck if a man sees them as a block of cheese with a hole are we supposed to be happy about that oh he doesnt really want you but hes horny and you have a hole and because of that he wants to fuck you soyeah female privilege xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but this situation is still the exception and not the rule
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the same way women arent screaming from the rooftops for betas to hear when they get railed by chads men arent telling everyone they know when they dump a fuck into some fat slag
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol you take what men say for granted really the sex that lies about their n count what men say they want and what they do is like how chicks fuck chads in their youth and then claim they love their ugly old husbands who cares dude chads will fuck women who are ugly chads will fuck anything when they are drunk
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what part of no one bats was ambiguous to you that was my original claim that even very attractive men have fucked some women theyll stay quiet to the grave about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that thing you didnt say is so wrong wow thanks for letting me know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they act as if ugly women have some powerful force that sucks in all kinds of sexy men and that ugly women have all banged like gym bro brad pitts its insane
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only people that think being some dudes cum dumpster is great are incels and quasi incels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because attractive men i know go to bars and such and they dont have trouble meeting equal attractive women to take home because theyre attractive enough to get with other attractive people mind blown
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in that case im lol do you see the word cute in the url
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,xd because unattractive women never feel unwanted or lonely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good job trolling bro keep it up then again i must be gay because i am not attracted to women with big tits and i like chicks like this right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because thats why trps think fat ugly white women are easily fucking chad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not what hypergamy is but nice try
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just because you dont know them doesnt mean they dont exist thats the problem you selectively remove people from your life who arent like you not intentionally it is just you gravitate to people like you this is why you dont see the average man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my entire moms side of the family is this fat chicks with thin average men and its as north as you can get
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whiskey dick means you cant hardly feel anything or get off which actually almost got me into major trouble because thats when your most likely to take the condom off
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,common does not mean universal know a few guys that have had so much drunk sex theyve essentially trained their bodies to get hard when drunk only lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe maybe not maybe he called every number in his little black book and none of them were ready to throw down maybe his fallback girls were unavailable and he went hogstickin
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have a few hot girls i can call butthey have their own lives as do i so i hop on tinder for a quick fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,cause ugly women cant be bad in bed i never said that it even implied it what i meant was that hot women who are also good in bed are the true unicorns i also meant that a lot of guys just want a hot girl to show off to their friends and thats fine arm candy is nice but there are a lot of hot boring women out there op should be a bit more clear
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but the person having sex with them thinks theyre fine why are you assuming this my point is that a guy with a high sex drive will be happy with just about any female body that has a warm hole that doesnt mean he would objectively call her attractive it just means shell do you can also pick at least one attractive feature on anyone too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i doubt they are going to memorialize it with a photo lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i want to see some photos of the attractive men you claim are easily laying pipe on equally attractive women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can find videos of them in pornhub with the right keywords
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they dont brag about those or take them out in public
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you forgot about tinder and other ways to meet women like the gym
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but why fuck an available ugly hole when you can fuck an available cute one does that make sense to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol the first one looks a lot like and they are just without their shirts on and airbrushed more or something and you think just because female models have been around those guys more suddenly they become unattractive um no thats not how attraction works
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol yeah i know a few models and their standards are so high most are still virgins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he is i dont know anyone who finds him extremely good looking except you just never heard it and hes well known in the us
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or they need a far more attractive man to be enthusiastic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so most women are fatugly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah we talk about women not teenager girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats because yall are interesting male sexuality is boring
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i watched chads fuck and and easily i have never seen a chad fuck a just like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,escorts are for ugly rich men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what stop putting words in my mouth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uh no just because a guy doesnt think the woman hes trying to sleep with is as hot as she should be that doesnt mean that he should be halfassing it if shes not hot enough to command his full effort then he shouldnt be trying to sleep with her if he is trying to sleep with her he should be giving her his full effort just like he would to a hotter woman men complain about how beta bux guys dont get his wifes full sexual attention and i agree that sucks the guys who knowingly married gold diggers dont get much sympathy from me though since at that point its practically a business transaction but this is just as bad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so a rich person probably never eats crappy food rich people eat sushi steaks all sorts of delicious food so why would a hot person have sex with an ugly person
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you an ugly dude who cant even fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i mean fat no idea how much that is in freedom units at a normal height
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes thats fat and yes chads bang girls over pounds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for what its worth i wouldnt bang a chick i found unattractive i have done it in the past and it was totally not worth it some guys are way too concerned with notch count and quantity over quality not me though id rather be percent sexless for the month rather than fuck a chick i deemed ugly people are right in their assertion thoughsome guys will just bang anything i think its a little pathetic and compromising your standards to get laid is a hollow victory at best
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe his face is really ugly men always assume that hot body attractive not always no we are talking about men with perfect facial aesthetics and a superior height in relation to the majority of the men near them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he isnt ugly pretty face and he is a very social guy he beds everything from under the automod i linked articles about fat girls getting hot guys no idea why people deny it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,quit paying attention to what incel morons say
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yall act like men are chasing these woman dont nobody give a fuck if a man sees them as a block of cheese with a hole are we supposed to be happy about that to chads most women are blocks of cheese with a hole they still get laid whenever they want whats your point again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its definitely not a rule but you would be surprised
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or maybe they just hmmarent dumping a fuck into some fat flag gross
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wtf does it even mean to bat like wtf xd like im supposed to understand that and ok yeah some hot guys do that so are ugly women post to be happy about that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly xd fools
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,brad pitt and george clooney claimed that when they were young and not famous they couldnt get laid to save their lives you think hot girls arent used to hot guys oh yeah hot girls are going to drop their panties just like that for guys in their league just like average women do it for average men huh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and they fuck all kinds of women for all kinds of reasons its easier to pump and dump less attractive women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,show us a picture of those socalled attractive women and men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in that case im lol do you see the word cute in the url hes cute to averagelooking women what does it matter that average and below average women find a guy to be hot all that matters is how hot girls think of him and anyway ive been told by chicks that im cute too skinny but cute meh cute doesnt mean shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats easy to solve for women all it takes is for women to not store food for the upcoming winter in their bellies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wtf does that have to do with anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah ok so how exactly is any of this purplepilldebate shit forum of any credibility when blue pill women just spend most of the time talking shit about men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sounds like some rpers have a sad superiority complex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fuck cares what the dictionary definition is for hypergamy we use hypergamy as a code word for chicks who go for men out of their league trying to make them commit to them you dont like how we see it or how we think or the way we use words in our world too bad not my problem tbh unless a chick fulfills my ideal of what a hot girl is i really dont care what she thinks or what she says sorry about that we can be reddit antagonists to each other it would be so cool can i be zorro
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,military base yajust proved my point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never been in the military nor have i lived near a military base i would see it too i used to work in jobs that served the public and i would just look at couples side note women who live off of military men who might be overseas never cheat on them right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are trashy places in the north too forgot about those shitholes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ew that means they drink way too much
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this sounds like more something that would happen in a frat movie for laughs not real life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or maybe they just dont have sex with women far uglier than them because they dont want or need to weird concept i know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nobody likes to be reminded that they speared a hog
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wow so luxurious right ugly women should be so happy that men wont even claim them in public but shes getting laaaaaid reeeeee
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i didnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because some times the ugly hole is right there and the cute hole takes calling arranging and shit also because you already banged the cute hole and want some variety
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id rather fuck a hole thats grateful to fuck me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because its harder to get the cute one and you have to put effort into yourself to do it because its more easy to get this second without waiting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because it isnt mutually exclusive you can bang both
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do my chad friends date women who are considered ugly because these girls suck dick on demand when the lights off a guy doesnt really notice if shes ugly or if shes a young natalie portman when you can fuck an available cute one does that make sense to you what makes you think that a cute hole is not going to expect more from a man than just being pretty does that make sense to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nothing i do makes sense to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol the first one looks a lot like and no he doesnt once you spend enough time with male models you can figure out easily who is the chad and who isnt the blonde guy is just average and you think just because female models have been around those guys more suddenly they become unattractive um no thats not how attraction works sigh i should get a prize for humoring teenager girls on ppd attractive is that attractive attractive doesnt mean anything when everyones attractive theres gotta be more than just attractive for a chick to want casual sex at least quality chicks thats where the chad looks come in and thats why the dude with the perfume bottle would have female models throwing themselves at him for casual sex but the blond guy wouldnt thats not how attraction works awww explain to me how attraction works then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you clearly never watched a little show called top model those chicks were all cheating on their boyfriends in one episode with other male models
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know any ugly women funny how that goes huh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or they need a far more attractive man to be enthusiastic yes they do but theres a chick on another thread saying female models are throwing themselves at male models because they are attractive she thinks attractive women respond with the same clitoriented wetness when they see a man of equal looks as averagelooking women do when they see an averagelooking male model lel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the us most women are overweight so are most men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so most women are fatugly yes or average which is the same as ugly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol sure and sugar babies only charge for their company
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not you stated filet mignon was that is costlier than hamburger unless you get yours with caviar and truffles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol fatties yelling at ugly dudes guess the old ugly guys need to lower standards aint happening after all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh well if thats the case yeah fat girls get laid all the time me and my beastly pound body full of rolls are going around crushing mens bodies on the daily
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this girl in the second pic is fat to you she weighs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are men who go months without it because they wont have sex with an ugly girl its not hard to this the internet exists people act like men everywhere go out and fuck everything even knew a virgin when i was younger who was well overweight and he wouldnt have sex with girls in his league he stayed a virgin just because he wouldnt have sex with his equals lol he was holding out for a girl well above his league
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe hes a sex addict
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i already responded to that go look
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there seems to be a lot of overlap between incel and red pill o just being honest
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are we supposed to be happy about that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like who even makes these slurs up in their head just a bitter rotten motherfucker
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive witnessed average beta males have sex with very low smv women just for the fun of making fun of her especially since those girls are more willing to do things like ass to mouth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i bet medieval princesses based their courtly behavior on watching you talk and act
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,obviously theyre not supposed to be happy but thats not really the argument
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd xd you growing out of your kikis phase yet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,brad pitt and george clooney claimed that when they were young and not famous they couldnt get laid to save their lives ryan gosling got his start because the director specifically chose a guy that wasnt the romantic ideal fame has gone on to make him more attractive one of brad pitts first roles was as a dirty stoner you wouldnt look twice at
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why is it easier if anything the unattractive one might cling onto him even more than an attractive one that he pumped and dumped because its the most attractive guy she banged
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what a crock there are hot women who would be into that guy just as long as they like blonde men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and all it takes for male incels to get laid is to store more food in their bellies and lift weights if you want to play this game
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes mad because i implied he was gay in an older thread for only liking certain type of girls lol dude literally only likes one specific body type really skinny a cup tiny butt its odd lol he is not into boobs or curves in any sense he even told he had sex with a girl with c cups and really didnt like them he only likes a cups its strange to me to be that picky he has a super narrow view of what is hot he doesnt even like fit girls with big butts like that chick you posted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what thread was that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as if you dont talk shit on women lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how does that indicated a superiority complex i dont understand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that isnt what hypergamy is if youre not going to use a word properly then dont use it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so essentially anyone who isnt in your direct social circle that does this is beneath you and not representative of your social circle and becuase its you thats all that matters btw they have a name dependapotamus theres million serviing members probably that retired and in every major city not so easy to dismiss as a minority of bumpkins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so which trashy one are you from every girl ive ever seen act with this disdain tends to resent it from experience and i think i asked elsewhere did you move to la or nyc chicago maybe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whatever you need to support your delusion i guess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you so adamantly protecting your view that chads dont fuck uglier women than them because of a particular personal experience
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or maybe they do but youre at home with your cats and dont see it why do you think you know more about male sexuality than men if you want to talk about what dick tastes like i will take your word for it if you try to womansplain how men do or do not lower their standards based on the available pussy i will ask you to walk a mile in my balls before you claim to know what a horny man will or will not do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if a woman is so bad looking that it brings them such terrible flashbacks for the rest of their life then why would they do it in the first place this makes no sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i didnt say anything of the sort i just know some fat girls who get fucked by hot guys but the guys never take them to meet their friendsdont talk about them its sad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,😂
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not hard for no baller to get a model xd these women are literally on their dick for a come up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol not thirsty insta thots and camwhores xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you pretty much think any woman who doesnt fit into your really narrow mold of really skinny with small boobs and butt is unattractive that insta thot girl that skratt posted would be considered hot by many guys but you are of course trashing her it is useless to reason with you when you have such a narrow view of attractiveness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh lord blonde man is not attractive this again you clearly just dont like blondes you said another blonde model looking guy was average too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,beyond a certain female attractiveness money gets where looks dont for a man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well played sir
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that guy is just mad that its true that the attractive dudes can be selective and they dont have to bang the ugly chicks that are in an ugly dudes league it makes the ugly dudes feel better to be like the hot guys are taking all those ugly chicks i should be banging lol something thats hardly even happening but in their little world is happens constantly lol and ive seen a legit ugly dude get laid with chicks hotter than him its because he actually had a cool personality if youre ugly and boring then you have seriously bad genes and maybe im a monster but i just dont feel sorry for those people they should be weeded out because theyre pretty much useless to society
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women dont get laid men get laid it takes skill or superior looks for men to get laid all it takes for women to get fucked is to have a snatch and in the case of the trangenders not even that is a requirement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah shes fat dreamgirl and kirsten never began life as a fat chick btw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh yes wanting to fuck a lot of girls must mean hes a sex addict i should introduce you to this male model that looks like a young brad pitt he has no standards so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you over estimate the ease attractive men have even if they have a few booty calls on the side they might not always be available male view on sexuality is not the same as women i have generally only chased women i found attractive but when attention from them was scarce i would head to areas i wasnt generally interested in looking for an option
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well thats disgusting but im talking about attractive men here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fuck is that supposed to mean xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes it is the argument yall are forever screaming from the rooftops like a bunch of wild dogs ugly womenz can get laid by attractive menzzz lolol privilege when the shit doesnt even happen often
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope hopefully ill stay youthful and laugh a lot until i die i dont ever wanna grow out of that so did you get your dick wet yet xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i knew hot dirty stoners they fucked hot stoner girls its just a different type of hot person
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ryan gosling got his start because the director specifically chose a guy that wasnt the romantic ideal fame has gone on to make him more attractive hes attractive but hes not really like a dude whod inspire a whole generation of women to get wet for him like brad pitt did and still does and jon bon jovi did fame has gone on to make him more attractive ehhh he does have a perfect body that might play a part and the fame he has sure it can make him more appealing to women not that he cares about it hes married so one of brad pitts first roles was as a dirty stoner you wouldnt look twice at oh i saw that movie he looked like any stoner youd find on the beach a good shower and shave does wonder to a mans smv the long greasy hair the beard and the trucker clothes made him look like an old man whe he was so young does he look like the worlds greatest sex symbol of the last years there nope styling clothes proper grooming means a shit ton to increase a mans smv something that a lot of young men today dont pay attention to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its easier because a woman when shes looking for casual sex is looking for the hottest man she can find so a is going to easily put out for a a woman is not going to do it that easily a girl will think a guy is cute but he still has to entertain her and that shit is hard work and effort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ladies and gentlemen we are floating in female solipsism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is easier because they are more receptive to them they dont have to make a whole dance for women just as pretty as them or slightly less pretty it also has to do with who is in his proximity it is like eating a microwave pizza vs cooking normal food the pizza you only have to throw in the microwave but with normal food you still have to cut the veggies cook the rice stirfry the veggies cut the meat and cook it ect it is relatively more hassle all in all it is easier
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you know those women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope lots of incels are not overweight at all and have pleasant physical features women are still all going for the same handful of chads if you want to play this game i am not in the mood to deal with teenagers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol he doesnt like non white women either likethats cutting off of the human population xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when did i talk shit on women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that isnt what hypergamy is if youre not going to use a word properly then dont use it i have never seen a more fitting use for the word autism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they didnt look that nice to me lower middle class or middle class everyone looks wealthier at their wedding lol i know upper middle class people and their weddings looked better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think youre the one with that issue maybe get out more in a normal town or city not complete bum hicksville where a hot man only has like options most hot men dont even live in shitty little backwoods towns they live in large cities or large suburbs where there are plenty of attractive women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well since you brought it up it tastes like any other part of the body
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are being autistic about this lol because men are horny because men dig holes on the ground and fuck it because men will fuck other men even when they arent gay because men need to bust a nut women do not need it or at least nearly as much as men do ive seen chads and yes chads with physically perfect faces height bodies big dicks they like coloured balloons or whatever other shit you consider makes a chad a chad and they were with ugly fat chicks they didnt have a fat fetish they just wanted to get laid badly anytime they wanted without effort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because alcohol duh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yea people act like its such an amazing novelty wow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no that doesnt happen the worlds specialist on what chads sleep with or dont is saying that chads only fuck equally hot women do take care tho if you tell her guys like girls with small tits shell say the guy is gay and that he needs to go fuck guys instead of bothering with girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as in like regularly where do you live are these guys really that good looking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you pretty much think any woman who doesnt fit into your really narrow mold of really skinny with small boobs and butt is unattractive that insta thot girl that skratt posted would be considered hot by many guys but you are of course trashing her im supposed to be attracted to chicks with fat asses because thats what other guys are into oh white guys are into asian women ive never been sexually attracted to asian women what am i gay or racist huh gimme a break it is useless to reason with you when you have such a narrow view of attractiveness considering you spent days calling me homosexual for being into women with thin bodies and small tits thats kinda rich no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh lord blonde man is not attractive how many times do i have to explain that attractive is not chad do you know what a chad is its not an attractive man its a man who is far more attractive than all of the attractive men by far look at troy every man who was laying siege to ancient troy was an alpha they had the looks the physical prowess the name the ancestry but who was the top dog in the illiad achilles hes the one who is praised as the most beautiful man in all of the story the chad hes the ancients greeks apex chad his hair was golden like the summer sun like fields of endless gold that lighten the way for mankind to reach for the stars his eyes were green like esmeralds and no other demigod could come close to his physical beauty you clearly just dont like blondes hahahahahahahahahahaha you honestly have no idea what you are talking about you think i dont like blondes if you ever visited the chat youd find out about my utter fixation on blonde women and blond men for fucks sake two of my ancestors were ss officers im a white neonazi nationalist and somehow i dont like blondes i would go to war with russia just to get a date with that girl that must mean i dont like blondes lol you said another blonde model looking guy was average too hes average within the context of chads if everyone has the same level of smv no one is attractive to the point of being considered a chad its like lets imagine this if you can do it lets say in the far future every man has the same level of aesthetics brad pitt had when he was young that means brad pitt is the average theres someone else who is far more attractive than he is same shit goes for male models theres attractive for everyone else in the world but pray do tell what the fuck does it matter at all to be hotter than nearly everyone else in the world when all that matters in life is to be the most attractive of all the people who are considered to be attractive that blonde model is not average to regular people hes average to hot people to chads to staceys to the women who are and see dudes like that a dozen a day
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,money buys whores whores are just expensive cum dumpsters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,super woosh if you want a prettier girl you gotta pay a prettier penny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pot meet kettle you havent been any better and lash out at anyone who disagrees i laughed whrn you said anyone outside of your social circle were low class hicks ive met girls like you very bland with wonderful instagram accounts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then why am i not xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is it hard to tell if shes fat or not look at the picture and say yes or no you people are nuts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hmm no i think average men just want to think that attractive men bang uglies like they do like were all in this together type of thing the hard truth is that attractive men dont have trouble fucking hot women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it was sarcasm what he was really saying was that you talk like ghetto trash that would probably violate rule be civil so he said the opposite of what he meant in an ironic fashion xp lololol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youll have to find your sympathy somewhere else for doesnt happen often im sure youve heard the argument times just like ive heard yours times but women dont realize that doesnt happen often doesnt happen ever for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why are you yet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most women i know will expect a guy to put his full effort into entertaining her regardless of whether theyre conventionally attractive or not nobody wants to feel like someones choice believe it or not even women who arent conventionally attractive want to be with guys who make her feel like the most beautiful person in the world
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats the thing though the richer a guy is the easier it is for him to order quality take out rather than have to microwave food apply that to male hotness the hotter he is the easier for him to access better looking women easily tinder and bars exist women are more open to being fwbs and fbuddies etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,guys with pleasant physical features only have trouble getting laid if they have ridiculously high standards
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whiteonly preference is quite common in the us less common in men but there are women who would only datefuck white guys some of them are pocs too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol are you crazy im just pointing out that constantly screaming in fatugly womens face about how easy they have it is fucking retarded xd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men will fuck other men even if they arent gay are you serious right now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also i have a feeling there are a lot of hot guys out there who secretly love fucking fat girls but are too chicken to admit openly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you literally told me in another thread that you had sex with a girl with c cups and didnt like them at all but that a lot of other guys thought she was hot your preferences for tiny tits no curves and small butts dont match a lot of other mens and you even admitted it unless you were just trolling and actually like breast sizes other than a cups but it is honestly really weird to only like one breast size never heard that in my life thats why i implied you might want to switch teams
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nyc yep lots of chubby chasers but only incognito
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,insta thots fuck ballers and anything else with money because they want that money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sometimes i dont understand either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh my god lol days i implied it like one time because yeah its pretty weird when you diss some girls boobs for being too big a girl you claimed all your friends think is hot its just an oddly specific thing to say i dont like c cup boobs like you dont realize how picky it sounds you are so dramaticmust be why you have such a narrow view of whats hot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if someone likes blondes then yeah the blonde guy could be a chad get over it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they are ive met people outside and theyre terribly trashy people in military and in southern shit towns are trashy anyone who thinks they arent are either poor or in the military themselves its a combination o being poor and uneducated which leads to trashiness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then why are you not what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can support that but i will say that painting all men like that is not totally correct i have know chads who only take home dimes and i have knows chads who are less descerning however i also hate people who aplit hairs to prove their points so i will concede your point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont give a fuck about sympathy xd you serious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most women i know will expect a guy to put his full effort into entertaining her regardless of whether theyre conventionally attractive or not yes and thats hilarious when girls think they should be entertained despite lacking the looks to make any man envious of the dude whose arm shes hanging off from fat and ugly women think they are attractive because the male thirst is so high theyll fuck anything that moves why should a woman who isnt hot be treated with preferential treatment why do girls im not attracted to ressent that i call them dude and treat them like i treat guys why shouldnt i treat with care and love the girls im attracted to instead theyre hot they earned their right to sit at the throne of the smv i laugh so hard when chicks who fucked other guys casually think they are entitled to be treated like girlfriend material nobody wants to feel like someones choice believe it or not even women who arent conventionally attractive want to be with guys who make her feel like the most beautiful person in the world women are the narcissus of the sexes they want the treatment angelina jolie gets without having the smv to make gorgeous children like angelina jolie has thats selfish beyond belief i dont doubt you for a second i once was at a restaurant and i saw an average man drop an expensive dinner all expenses paid given to an averagelooking girl thats how much men put pussy on a pedestal so sad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol im just going to politely sit here laughing and not say a thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can only eat so much food so if youre rich youre better off eating what you like most of the time the male demand for casual sex however is muchhhh higher than female supply thats why some hot guys will fuck all kinds of girls theres this more is better mentality among a lot of guys
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even then the microwave pizza is easier chances are he already has it in the freezer and only has to wait mins before eating it while with take out he has to wait mins or more and he has to pay more money for it ie effort so your analogy doesnt even add up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,guys with pleasant physical features have standards and want to get laid with their equals
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is more to it though onkle julian allegedly only likes white girls who are super skinny with little boobs thats some pretty narrow tastes to be having he specifically claimed in another thread that he had sex with a girl with c cups and didnt like her boobs at all but that other guys thought she was really hot so basically b c ds and breast implants are out thats nuts and he doesnt like fit chicks with big asses either not open to asians or hispanics at all just white girl with tiny tits and tiny ass fucking weird
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not that common
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would an attractive man have sex with an ugly woman if he can do better here is the title of the thread compare that with what you said
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh my sweet summer child one day you may read of the phenomenon known as situational homosexuality prison wives buggery on the high seas or any situation where men find themselves without female companionship and put it in any available hole
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men do that when there are no women available like in prison it doesnt change their sexual orientation either they live a normal heterosexual life after they get out of prison
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ever heard of ancient greece men were set apart from women what were they supposed to do fuck a wall its hilarious that chicks think they are in the same league of a male because he fucked them nope guys will fuck anything when they are horny that includes those celebs girls flick the bean to fuck the greatest heartrob the uk has had in the last years was fucking ugly cheap street whores get out of here with your chads only fuck their equal bs lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lot i doubt that fat porn exists mostly as a funny thing for people to look at like a spectacle most men arent masturbating to it who look at it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you literally told me in another thread that you had sex with a girl with c cups and didnt like them at all but that a lot of other guys thought she was hot your preferences for tiny tits no curves and small butts dont match a lot of other mens and you even admitted it im white lots of white guys have a thing for asian women i dont im not attracted to black women there are white men attracted to black women do my preferences make me gay no did the other dudes think the chick was hot yes good for them your preferences for tiny tits no curves and small butts dont match a lot of other mens and you even admitted it having different preferences in women is now wrong it makes me a closeted homosexual i get told a lot by women that im gay its getting annoying go fetch me jennifer lawrence work some magic for her to see me as a chad and ill raw dog her without stopping unless you were just trolling and actually like breast sizes other than a cups but it is honestly really weird to only like one breast size never heard that in my life thats why i implied you might want to switch teams you seem young as you grow older youll come across lots of men who like different things in women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am from a nice area and i knew no attractive men who were chubby chasers lol like there were girls who were big but just no one paid attention to them im sure i wouldve heard about it if it happened there was lots of gossip and the big girls were all loud a lot of hot guys just arent into big women and wont sleep with them period
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah and having to deal with that is a right pain in the fucking ass no thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and the guys get the pussy fair trade
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all the things youre listing are recent trends that dont have much of anything to do with trpmanosphere or alphas or men wanting to be alphas men have wanted to be alpha and attract multiple women for sex from the dawn of time it has also been true since the dawn of time that most men cannot attract multiple women for sex at least not simultaneously trpmanosphere is a direct reaction to changes in sexual mores and sexual relationships brought on by feminism increasing female independence and sexual deregulation and increasing automation job elimination and economic pressures
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,average is over in an age of extreme plenty and excess anyone can be average at something and if you want to be recognized you have to really strive above and beyond the cult of the alpha is really just a scramble to stay on top of the market and in demand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,were at an interesting time right now the gap between rich and poor is getting crazy with that comes the gap between attractive and unattractive there will be no more middle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you think that todays extreme entertainment culture is part of what drives the cultural shift toward the alpha male because alpha males are an extreme representation of masculinity like superman or batman so you watch big bang theory and you say to yourself these dudes are whats driving a cultural shift toward alpha males nope sensitive ended with metrosexual man with a heavy dusting of feminine features that shit was boring pendulum is just swinging the opposite way as it always does nerd culture is just a sideeffect of the internet its suddenly cool to be a trekkie and go to cons nerd culture isnt just superheroes and oily buff dudes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,superman is a higher beta such a fucking pussy batman is an alpha who helps the weak because of childhood trauma conan is your correct representation of a straightforward alpha male and he always has his current pussy not far behind but he is also an old figure hes not really part of and later culture we dropped this top level masculine man from our media in exchange for weaker or more feminine counterparts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you listed a lot of things that are definitely occurring but i disagree with your explanation of why they are happening what you describe as nerd culture with the exception of music seems like the effects of extended adolescence and immaturity in general i dont understand how lil wayne or edm are nerd culture so youll have to explain it in more detail i also disagree that mainstream society encourages men to be alphasbasically i think that the extreme entertainment culture is the result of the immature and childteenlike state a lot of people are in so they are drawn to spectacle novelty dont care about artificiality want everything to be larger than life etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think spectacle creates a binary between the active creative forces and the passive viewers the viewers are not empowered by this addictive relationship to content and are only manipulated financially the images being show are violent kinetic and pornographic while the viewer remains completely still observing living only vicariously so entertainment culture leads in part to groups like the red pill because many mens perceived selves are disconnected from their physical abilities weve all internalized ideals but we cant attain synchronization with them this causes agitation which leads to venting on a societal scale such as the harassment seen in gamergate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nerd culture is a big deal nowadays because the internet started in earnest about years ago and now all of us that grew up reading comic books about superheroes watching anime thundercats ho etc are now of prime spending age late nerds were super common in this era because the nerd topics were the quality entertainment of the day the internet gave us all a way to find one another and create those subcultures in what were once independent pursuits people sell what makes them money mma took off because boxing became a joke due to corruption regarding music well if pacman had affected us as kids wed all be running around in dark rooms munching pills and listening to repetitive electronic music ― marcus brigstocke
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the definition of nerd hasnt changed at all the word used to refer to nerds has nerd now means chad with glasses and neckbeard basement dweller manchild mean what nerd used to because nerd culture became mainstream well a bastardised version and they had to find new words to vilify the actual nerds with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no not really what we are seeing today is more of a mix of retroism as you said but more of a backlash against the metrosexualism of the i am very glad i got out of male crap the year before beards and slick back hair became was vogue bleh eventually we will have retroism and men will become neometrosexual our culture is fucking dying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think people can depend on institutions less marriage higher ed a factory job etc whether its true or not jobs seem to be more scarce education carries less of a guarantee of stability the ability to create a stable and loving family feels more elusive for more people trp is like the gospel of prosperity its based on a kind of faith that is internally self promoting its not so much an answer to problem that the institution is not working but an attempt to create a new institution i think youre right to look at other trends but the trend trp is addressing is an institutional breakdown of the family unit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not really understanding the connection youre trying to make between the alpha male caricature and nerd culture however i totally get what youre saying about popculture nerds vs classical nerds its been a dilution of classical nerd culture classical nerds do not or simply cannot purchase their nerddom whereas pop culture nerds their nerddom comes out of a box i think this has everything to do with the rise of the internet the video game industry and the proliferation of entertainment culture in general theres the techbro phenomenon now too tech entrepreneurs now rank among some of the richest people alongside lawyers doctors bankers etc thats made the tech industry much more sexy over the past couple of decades
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i feel like if it encourages a male to be the best of himself to do it however i dont subscribe to game or pua because guys who have experience in dating dont need all that to get a woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think that the concurrent rise in alpha male ideology and superhero imagery is a coincidence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes very much this sexual access in future decades will be feast or famine youre either a winner or a loser no in between as a man youll either swim in pussy or get absolutely nothing it will be either take home a different girl from the bar every weekend or a lifetime of porn and hookers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,extreme plenty and excess this usually contributes to waste so its a bonanza for bottom feeders temp employees dumpster divers and resellers of crap
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but people fear their wives cheating with the pool boy because most rich people are old and therefore less attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not talking about the nerd culture portrayed in big bang theory im talking about the ontheground reality of what people around me like nerd almost always means comic book gamer and anime even trek is kind of marginalized none of the bbt guys are as obsessed with mma or big macs as the self styled nerds that i know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,attempting to draw alpha male and beta male analogies between superman and conan puts you squarely within the definition of nerd culture its become as much of your vocabulary as bible quotes make up a religious persons vocabulary
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nerd culture is a self identification people that listen to edm and enjoy spectacle comic books because books are uncool and memes of httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvasngjxjivw self identify as nerds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what in blue blazes does the internet have to do with reading superhero comics as a subcultural identity if anything the decline in any interest in internet privacy and security indicates that todays late demographic did not grow up with internet etiquette at all eternal september is as eternal as longcat is long all of snapchats user base needs to be slapped with a bit of large trout i was called technologically illiterate many times by selfstyled nerds for not having an adequate selfie record because youre a girl of course you take selfies or else you have no self esteem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,til lil wayne is a nerd and wrestling is nerdy oh and the british flag is nerdy too lol wtf is op even on about tldr everything i dont like is nerd culture those damn nerds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,our culture is fucking dying american culture just cycles and adds a few new bits and bobs each cycle i do kind of wish the beard trend would go away so i would be the only one with one as cool as mine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,more that i was called a nerd pejoratively quite often and now when i try to claim nerdiness its kind of taken from me because your interests arent nerdy you dont have any real interests because being interested in current events cars and your skin are not real interests like comics i was told i was computer illiterate many times for not having a data plan
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trump and cultural representations of masculinity are symptoms not a cause
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the ruse of superhero imagery is from moron hacks at hollywood having no new movie ideas i know lets make ant man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the concept of an alpha male is biological the details are social constructs new trends just replace the old ones but the natural desire men have to be the alpha male has and always will exist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no ancient greek mythology super hypermasculine gods and demigods and the attempts the rest of the men made to be like those apex alpha males creating societies dedicated to becoming physically perfect and with perfect aesthetics like in ancient sparta
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just natural selection dude below average men shouldnt have access to women and average men are the new ugly attractive is the new average and looks in men is the new attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a man youll either swim in pussy or get absolutely nothing as a woman youll either swim in sausage or get absolutely nothing i chose to check out of the smp and entertainment culture well except for interactive forums looks like i made the right choice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its modern mythology all we did was divorce our demigods from any semblance of ever existing and give them better iconographybrand awareness if you think superheroes still have a year olds idea of good and evil you havent read a thing since the comic book code authority these days we mock them when they have a year olds idea of good and evil the dc cinematic universe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,attempting to draw alpha male and beta male analogies between superman and conan puts you squarely within the definition of nerd culture its become as much of your vocabulary as bible quotes make up a religious persons vocabulary youre confusing geek and nerd women that are into cosmetics are cosmetic geeks not nerds just because a man is into gender dynamics doesnt make him a nerd but hes a geek about gender dynamics really too nerds are typically asocial or bad with people so again i reiterate your definition makes no sense and youre trying to take people and rationalize a definition instead of logically defining what a nerd is in a straightforward way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nerd culture is a self identification people that listen to edm and enjoy spectacle comic books because books are uncool and memes of httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvasngjxjivw self identify as nerds so you backwards rationalized what nerd culture is based on who consumes what classic woman thinking in no way shape or form is hip hop like lil wayne or edm or metalocalypse part of nerd culture rather nerds are not in just one culture hip hop and lil wayne are still part of hip hop and a black culture as well as american party culture edm is still part of edm party european culture metalocalypse is still part of metal culture sigh how disappointing why do i even expect differently just because im a nerd and rp doesnt make rp part of nerd culture
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when i was a kid preinternet and i read daredevil the only person i had to talk to about it with was my brother dd hysteria was at an all time high comic book shops were arcane mysterious places run by smelly cheeto stained men where girls dared not tread when i was i got an internet pen pal at school early version of email when i was we got compuerve suddenly there were thousands of people that i could talk to about daredevil and spawn and the youngbloods and captain america suddenly reading comics became cool because i had a peer group that was into them when before irl there was none previously we were loners the internet made it possible to have a subcultural identity for material that wasnt necessarily niche but also wasnt mainstream given years that no longer niche reaches a point to push it into mainstream consciousness and continues to pick up steam from there i mean everyone liked batman and superman back then see tim burtons batman movies but they were silly schlock not taken seriously now they are because there are enough long term fans think about it this way if you were really into football you need friends to play it you had to go out and meet people and show them how cool it is and create or join a group if you were really into videogames you dont need any friends to play them the internet gave us access to others that were doing individual activities and so we created those groups there instead
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i definitely agree that trump superman and gangster rap are related phenomena i also think the altright and dark enlightenment imagery comes from anime and comics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,spider pig hog man rotten egg man super mall cop super baby super mall cop vs the fried chicken bomber pedobear super mudkip pepe the fascist frog super sjw man pleb man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a woman youll either swim in sausage or get absolutely nothing the default is swimming in sausage weve been over this in other threads default woman is a winner and default man is a loser no surprise that men are going crazy trying to outdo each other while women sit around watching netflix and tinder swiping
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really most women can get laid most women can get laid with decentlooking men even with alpha males only the really ugly and extremely fat women have a hard time getting laid with attractive men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,modern mythology you must have a pretty low opinion of mythology some people cant differentiate michaelangelo and frank frazetta
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre confusing geek and nerd you just played yourself by differentiating between geeks and nerds where do you find yourself on httpbrunchingcomgeekhierarchyhtml lel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was using the concept of the rectification of names words have meanings and their meanings change over time like the republican party no longer being materially the party of lincoln but a bunch of dixiecrat populists what you call nerd is no longer the definition of what a nerd is the consensus is that dragon ball z and cartoons are more of a part of nerd culture than previous nerd culture staples like the geek code trout slap filk music etc most nerds ive met do not know who the hell feynman is for example but they sure do fuckin love science they are science fiction fans who may foggily know who asimov is from a distance but their immediate concerns revolve around science fiction comics im not going to try to fit the square pegs of what used to be nerd culture into the round hole that it is today
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the same thing happened with me and the arts as well as some other topics none of my friends cared about the music or art i liked outside of popular stuff so i talked about it on forums and learned how it was made but i dont really identify with music as a cultural identity years after the fact like these folks would actually get a tattoo of spiderman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i definitely agree that trump superman and gangster rap are related phenomena in that they are all very masculine and both men and women like to experience raw exaggerated masculinity yeah would be an even better example than superman that was the movie that motivated me to start weightlifting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pleb man i better start making an audition tape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my friend in high school was a fake cologne vendor near my house who regaled the public with tales of conspiracy theories and one of his associates an unemployed construction worker sat on a barstool in the street and hollered at women this was his version of tinder i guess he was trying to outdo other men in loudness and profanity i told him that he could be sued for sexual harassment but he said that this was how he got dates
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,default woman is a winner and default man is a loser to be fair default woman is a winner from a mans point of view not from a womans a gay man on the other hand is a winner all around the bastards
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really ugly yours truly since my bmi is like
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,either that or you have no idea how much of ancient mythology is dull and repetitive or just plain evil i also cant take anyone seriously who thinks herculess labors were better written than anything gail simone or neil gaiman ever wrote it just shows me that you make snap judgements based on your prejudices and put as much thought into this as anything trp ever posted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre confusing geek and nerd you just played yourself by differentiating between geeks and nerds where do you find yourself on httpbrunchingcomgeekhierarchyhtml lel somewhere in the middle lol perhaps i had it backwards people really into a subject are nerds about that subject asocial people into weird things are geeks geek the word geek is a slang term originally used to describe eccentric or nonmainstream people in current use the word typically connotes an expert or enthusiast or a person obsessed with a hobby or intellectual pursuit with a general pejorative meaning of a peculiar person especially one who is perceived to be overly intellectual unfashionable or socially awkward nerd nerd adjective nerdy is a descriptive term often used pejoratively indicating a person that is overly intellectual obsessive or lacking social skills such a person may spend inordinate amounts of time on unpopular obscure or nonmainstream activities which are generally either highly technical abstract or relating to topics of fiction or fantasy to the exclusion of more mainstream activities additionally many nerds are described as being shy quirky pedantic and unattractive and may have difficulty participating in or even following sports though originally derogatory nerd is a stereotypical term but as with other pejoratives it has been reclaimed and redefined by some as a term of pride and group identity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you didnt address my argument at all youre working backwards with your definitions and coming to retarded conclusions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,kek
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the purpose of mythology is kind of orthogonal to the purpose of literature though when i was talking about written mythology i was thinking more about literature based on mythology stuff like ovids metamorphoses dante milton la morte darthur etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rofl you think gil simone or neil gaiman ever wrote anything as good as the guy who wrote the hercules labors lmao lmao
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,these are definitions today a nerd is a guy who likes comics video games and scifi television and movies i have friends who are in nerd geek culture im definitely a peculiar person with peculiar interests who is quirky pedantic and unattractive but because im not part of a pop culture fandom my friends tell me im not a nerd or a geek and i accept that the definitions have changed significantly well ive definitely been called a nerd pejoratively quite a few times in my life but today im considered a legbeard and part of the cel family incel volcel marcel nearcel etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what prevents someone from using comic books for literature have you read the sandman although it began as a cheesy tribute to old horror comics and was set in the dc universe it became a meditation on the nature of stories and human nature and issue won httpsenwikipediaorgwikiworldfantasyaward for short fiction despite being judged against prose
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you choose to be celibate what is marcel and nearcel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,look i dont consider stuff like isaac asimov or lord of the rings to be literature either like the star wars soundtrack or any soundtrack isnt art music that doesnt mean i dont respect it its something else its a book its fiction but its materially different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i dont read books for kids
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,married celibate near celibate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,isaac asimov iswell more about the ideas than anything his weaknesses in other areas limit him to genre appeal the sandman aims more towards dante milton and shakespearian tragedy running side by side with modern day slice of life it has its flaws but the raw ingredients are all there also keep in mind when you look at the best of the past youre excluding percent of what was out there we remember dante and milton not the nun who wrote spiritual bdsm with bonus antisemitism or satans medieval obsession with fart jokes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,best of the past youre excluding percent of what was out there this is kind of part of the point comparing the sandman to shakespeare also proves my point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its selfreported as much as people are loath to acknowledge it there are tons of suggestible andor lowintelligence andor neurotic andor indoctrinated andor ideologicallymotivated females who are perfectly capable of believing virtually all forms of unwanted sexual attention is sexual assault to give an example some drunken shithead sloppily making a move in a nightclub hardly constitutes sexual assault by any reasonable standard but im sure it accounts for a significant percentage of socalled sexual assaults on campus
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nonconsensual touching lumped in with rape who cares about this study again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is amazingly low and frankly not credible if sexual assault includes sexual harassment and if sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual attention women receive unwanted sexual attention as soon as they start looking pretty as mere girls it is extremely unlikely that they will only ever receive it from those men they are interested in that is to say from the one rock star they are all dreaming about in most of the remaining cases it will be unwanted this condition is called being human it is much more likely that almost of women will have received unwanted sexual attention at college and have therefore been by definition sexually assaulted i havent read the report but from the part you quoted it looks like a disgraceful coverup of the true extent of the campus rape epidemic which is so horrifying the ladies in the powder room s
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to put this in context of women have reported seeing a ghost the point is that these surveys dont mean much of anything especially when they are lumping rape in with nonconsensual touching a person that bumps into you is committing nonconsensual touchingbut why the fuck would you lump that in with rape other than to juice the numbers everyone has experienced one of these things at college so the fact that the results arent is what surprises me how about lets be adults and if we are going to do a survey to find out how many students are sexually assaulted or raped lets limit it to that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you genuinely think a western university campus is as unsafe for a woman as a refugee camp in dr congo youre probably brain damaged
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,including sexual harassment the other day on my bike a girl hollered something inappropriate at me im a victim by this standard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the surveys definition of sexual assault ranges from sexual harassment stalking and intimate partner violence to nonconsensual penetration and nonconsensual touching so basically any creep that eyeballed me is sexual harassment same nonsense as the study
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the surveys definition of sexual assault ranges from sexual harassment stalking and intimate partner violence to nonconsensual penetration and nonconsensual touching the latter are sexual assaults and usually the minority of incidents reported in similar studies while the former two clearly are not even with intimate partner violence if they used wonky definitions like raising your voice being violence then i suppose all three go together just as illegitimately im not going to bother reading the full survey because that one snippet alone makes it just as worthless as the dozens that i have dissected they conflate sexual assault with something else and then leave it up to the feminist media machine to later conflate sexual assault with rape as in thank you huffingtonfuckingpost for doing what you do best and providing me with an example
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pure bs given the amount of brainwashing the womens studies programs do these days
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nonconsensual touching aaaaaaand there we have it all you have to do is ask in the survey did you ever experience noncensual touching by members of the opposite sex and then count that as sexual assault thats how you get these numbers reminds me of an incident where i sexually assaulted a girl at college she said something goofy and i touched her forehead to check for elevated temperature and asked her are you well and she said stop it ie i touched her and obviously it was nonconsensual okay that wasnt in the survey and i guess most women will be smart enough to know that not every physical contact counts as this but i guess there will be enough who got their ass touched while in a club and count that as sexual assault especially considering the paranoia thats going on at campuses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sexual harassment hi susie you sure look nice today nonconsensual touching putting your arm around your date taking her hand leaning in for a kiss pretty much what humans have been doing since they were small hominids on the savanna if you write your questions to cast a wide enough semantic net anything can be anything stop genociding me with your downvotes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,someone touching you without consent is assault this gets blown way out of proportion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even looking at a girl the wrong way now counts as sexual harassment in many cases
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like most things in life the devil is in the details as to what specifically sexual assault is personally i think all of these things are bad even stuff that comes from people having sex while drunk its my opinion that sex with alcohol should be avoided and looked down upon because of all this shiz really you shouldnt be doing anything serious with alcohol that said there are different levels of sexual assault beating up and violently raping them is not on the same level as copping a feel even if they are both shitty we have this sort of conception with murder we should have it here also
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,according to their definition of sexual assault yes but that definition is ridiculously broad and unrealistic according to those surveys if a guy is flirting with a girl misreads her signals and tries to kiss her or cop a feel when she doesnt actually want it then its called sexual assault its a little ridiculous by that definition i have also been a victim of sexual assault on several occasions because girls have touched me in flirty ways to gauge my interest like feeling my arms chest or hair or grabbing my butt it sucks to get unwanted touching but i do not blame them i went out to a dance club last night and a really drunk girl grabbed on to me for a bit while dancing and then flipped me off good times it looks like im a victim of assault again oh woe is me another girl took my hand and got close to me on the dance floor without asking for my consent a girl cat called me out of a car while i was running around my neighborhood this week what are we going to do about all of these young criminal women going around sexually assaulting men these definitions of assault are completely based on the persons feelings about the actions rather than the actions themselves which is why they are not the legal definition
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im glad that they tried to define sexual assault but theyve only replaced one ambiguous term for another what does sexual harassment mean if being catcalled is sexual harassment then welcome to the thats still a far cry from the feminist claim that in women are raped in college also does anyone see the issue with lumping in the ambiguous term of sexual harassment with nonconsensual penetration in what world are either of those in the same ball park
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is getting drunk ducking a frat boy and regretting it count as sexual assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,til i learned that according to trp there is no such thing as rape unless the woman is actively fighting back and screaming no at the to of her lungs and even then thats usually bullshit because shades of grey proved that women adore abuse from alphas i also learned that denying men the right to grope women as they please is totally oppressive to men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how did they define stalking or sexual harassment or intimate partner violence often times these definitions are skewed and are basically based on how the woman feels for example theyll ask the women were you ever stalked and shell say yeah one guy followed me around one day im pretty sure he was following me around for more than that okay pretty sure lets not forget these kinds of studies are biased i remember talking to this one girl who told me about her experience of getting sexually harassed in the subway she said she was alone in one of the cars with a guy who was looking at her provocatively and made her feel uncomfortable she said he looked like he was going to take out his dick or that he was going to pounce on her he did neither but she equated her feeling of comfort and her perceived threat with sexual harassment surveys are flawed by definition because they rely solely on the feelings of the person being asked they work great when surveying about products and services but they are certainly not a decent indicator of crime its ridiculous to imply that a high number of men are sexual predators based solely on the feelings of victims
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,stalking and nonconsensual touching included in the definition i see
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you include sexual harassment and unwanted touching in that im surprised its not a lot higher i always though sexual assault had a much more fixed definition
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the surveys definition of sexual assault ranges from sexual harassment stalking and intimate partner violence to nonconsensual penetration and nonconsensual touching wow well theres your answer this is like defining assault as anything from someone yelling an insult at you to physically attacking you its pretty clear that there was a motive built into this study
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im an average looking guy thats been sexually assaulted by this criteria so i think its a bit wide however i dont see why some people on here are insisting that sexual assault doesnt happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and have not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ranges from sexual harassment already so broadly defined it can mean anything to intimate partner violence you mean acts that are not sexual assault but used here to dishonestly inflate the numbers as much as possible fucking ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thoughts who gives a rats ass about college girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to be honest i think its correct but not for the reason some people think sexual assault is not what most people imagine it to be it can include things like groping as i use public transport a lot i can tell you that random men groping you in buses is more common than some people think and no it was not accidental groping please i know when its accidental and when its not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to give an example some drunken shithead sloppily making a move in a nightclub hardly constitutes sexual assault by any reasonable standard but im sure it accounts for a significant percentage of socalled sexual assaults on campus if that counted as assault then very close to of women at least on my campus would have reported being assaulted not merely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly nothing to see here move along
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was just going to cite the same line its nonsense not only is all sex is rape everything is rape person bumped into me in line did i consent to it norape add me to the list
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nonconsensual touching lumped in with rape who cares about this study again ummwomen men that respect women parents of these young ladies how would you feel if someone you found threatening not attractive grabbed your junk hard and laughed why is that behavior ok
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know you used s so youre going to agree with this but not all women are completely crazy and falling for the feminist propaganda the actual percentage appears to be around of women are batshit insane of women are unfortunately actually victims
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is amazingly low and frankly not credible if sexual assault includes sexual harassment and if sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual attention my thoughts exactly street harassment is very common where i go to school id be shocked if i met a girl who hasnt experienced it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,would you say women are perhaps a bit hysterical about topics like sexual harassment or assault like that they look to upgrade even the slightest disturbance into higher categories of crime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same nonsense as the study ftfy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thank you huffingtonfuckingpost for doing what you do best and providing me with an example yeah the
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,looking at the survey it seems to be misreported of students report experiencing sexual harassment as best as i can tell that article is using the numbers for sexual assault and claiming that its inclusive of harassment and ipv
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the latter are sexual assaults and usually the minority of incidents reported in similar studies while the former two clearly are not yea i mean saying the definition of sexual assault is sexual harassment is an oxymoron or at least sounds like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but i guess there will be enough who got their ass touched while in a club and count that as sexual assault why should that not count
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,putting your arm around your date taking her hand leaning in for a kiss none of those are included in the definition of nonconsensual touching in the actual study
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sexual harassment hi susie you sure look nice today when has anyone ever considered that to be sexual harassment the only thing i can think of is if shes told them their comments make her uncomfortable and they refuse to stop
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gay man comes up to you grabs your junk thats okay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the definition of harassment in the study is as follows these next questions ask about situations in which a student at or someone employed by or otherwise associated with said or did something that  interfered with your academic or professional performance  limited your ability to participate in an academic program or  created an intimidating hostile or offensive social academic or work environment the specific behaviors referenced were taken from several different scales measuring harassment  made sexual remarks or told jokes or stories that were insulting or offensive to you  made inappropriate or offensive comments about your or someone elses body appearance or sexual activities  said crude or gross sexual things to you or tried to get you to talk about sexual matters when you didnt want to  emailed texted tweeted phoned or instant messaged offensive sexual remarks jokes stories pictures or videos to you that you didnt want  continued to ask you to go out get dinner have drinks or have sex even though you said no i do not see anything about looking here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i learned that according to trp there is no such thing as rape unless the woman is actively fighting back and screaming no at the to of her lungs yeah thats pretty much the only sane definition of rape using violence or threats of violence while verbal no is explicitly given the omg i cheated on my bf while drunk rape nonsense if feminist poison of any sane civilization
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,proved that women adore abuse from alphas it doesnt prove anything but it points out cases like this arent unheard of such as rhianna going back to chris brown after he physically abused her when she in theory could have any man she wanted i also learned that denying men the right to grope women as they please is totally oppressive to men gonna need a citation on that bro
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this isnt about sexual assault not happening this is about as you said it yourself the net being cast so ridiculously wide that it dilutes all meaning of the term as usual
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sexual assault is not what most people imagine it to be it can include things like groping well yea groping is sexual assault but this sexual assault ranges from sexual harassment stalking and intimate partner violence how is sexual assault also sexual harassment this makes no sense and how is stalking an assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre making the false assumption all women are the same what counts as sexual assault to idiots isnt the same as what more reasonable people would consider assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is it is just that of women dont count this as a violation while do the other were actually assaulted as per the doj numbers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the survey did include harrassmant which would possible include a drunken sloppy nightclub move from a shithead it is also self reporting so there is no reason that of people would not be honest if they did consider that they were sexually assaulted in many of these studies they also include having sex that you regret or whilst intoxicated this does not even imply any impropriety by the sexual partner
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do you think women are hysterical about this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this guy and girl are drunk and high together he has a grope she doesnt say anything he stops and asks if shes okay and now shes the brave survivor of sexual assault victim for the rest of her life so pathetic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a study of sexual assault not a study of rape nonconsensual sexual touching is in fact a form of sexual assault remember that in the us any form of touching with hostile intent is technically battery
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who says it is genital touching we are talking about girls who will count someones hand brushing anywhere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one is saying that the behavior is ok but it is feminists not all women and white knights not men that respect women who appreciate the mendacity of mixing up terms and definitions to make a rhetorical political point in this case
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he was talking about a meaningless study no one cares people seem to enjoy being outraged the study was for their benefit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not women in general but a portion of them who are looking for a reason to be victimized the word rape and harassment and assault have all lost meaning lately
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,better yet i could organize a poker run benefit ride for the victims
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually the original study came from more like it claimed that in had been raped we now have a report that completely undermines that in it says have merely been sexually assaulted under a broad catchall sexual assault so where did all the rape go
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the three biggest oxymorons i learned in law school were civil litigation legal reasoning and feminist thought
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because it dilutes the element of a crime as does the feminist logic that a rape is when a woman retroactively decides she was raped after she had drunk sex but youre free to explain why lightly grazing someones butt for a second or two is the same crime as groping a womans breasts touching her crotch and attempting to french kiss her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then make it putting your hand on your dates butt which i guess has happened assloads of times in the history of mankind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,everyone gets touched inappropriately in their life its not really that big of a deal you tell people to fuck off when they do shit like that if they keep doing it you escalate i dont think we need victim olympics here or nationwide dont touch people training programmes just some common fucking sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed, made sexual remarks or told jokes or stories that were insulting or offensive to you  made inappropriate or offensive comments about your or someone elses body appearance or sexual activities  said crude or gross sexual things to you or tried to get you to talk about sexual matters when you didnt want to  emailed texted tweeted phoned or instant messaged offensive sexual remarks jokes stories pictures or videos to you that you didnt want  continued to ask you to go out get dinner have drinks or have sex even though you said no so if you answered one of those with yes you would belong to the group of the sexually assaulted in this study
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,interfered with your academic or professional performance what in the world high amounts of homework definitely impacted my academic and professional performance there is nothing sexual about this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that seems like an incredibly subjective list not based in any sort of grounded definition of the word told jokes or stories that were insulting or offensive to you i meanreally if i tell a story that offends you im harassing you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,created an intimidating hostile or offensive social academic or work environment the first two are already a slippery slope all it takes is someone being so intimidated by sexual attention that this person avoids classes because of that but here the meaning completely goes out of the window simply because its entirely subjective and all you need is to be overly sensitive or ideologically brainwashed to feel that attention from the opposite sex constitutes an intimidating social or academic environment and i didnt even go into the similarly dumb followupquestions ie this survey lumps together actual victims with people who feel they have been victimized or people the surveyors feel have been victimized even if these claims may hold no water for any sane person
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,continued to ask you to go out get dinner have drinks or have sex even though you said no only in get this where did all the rape go these people should stop intellectually assaulting us were intelligent adults and deserve a bit of basic respect and decency
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thanks for proving how bullshit the study is this is gold
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats pretty much the only sane definition of rape using violence or threats of violence while verbal no is explicitly given exactly and preferably only when male witnesses agree it was rape correct cant be too sure about these things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rihanna lol she went back in spite of the beatings not because of them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think it can theoretically be counted as verbal assault if taken too far
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a sliding scale especially in college environments whats assault nice tits or get on my dick are common greetings in some circles making obscene gestures happens a lot and jokingly grabbing intimate body parts isnt that rare either all have happened to me in college but id only rate a few instances of the latter as assault because of the part grabbed situation andor intimidation factor some women count all unwanted touching of buttocks breast or crotch ive rarely ever met someone who counted obscene greetings or gestures perhaps a bit of an overreaction but if a bodybuilder you dont know did the same to you youd have your boxers in a bunch too persistently soliciting intimacy with a girl who has already clearly declined is a common occurrence for young women most places they go most rate this as annoying but nbd trying to convince by either threatening or physically coercing a girl for example in a bar is generally regarded as unwanted threatening and not ok amongst girls but only a few say out of would say thats assault now imagine that hairy visibly aroused bodybuilder doing the latter to you not pleasant right perhaps even scary for some then there are the dickwads who masturbate in public while close to you andor making eye contact this is seen as assault by most but rarely reported from personal experience happened about half a dozen times to me sometimes with female friends around try to dance with you in a way that ensures you can feel their erect member this is seen as assault by almost all women but once again seldomly reported to the authorities because both types of perpetrators are near impossible to catch drug your drink this only happened to me once i was safe in the end and didnt report as i didnt know who did it that stuff messes your memory up seen as criminal by every sane person but not always as assault unless that happens too dependent on the intent and success of the perpetrator despite being told no or even pushed away physically grab you and hold on while performing sexual acts take of your clothes or insert body parts into them or just straight out rape you i think we can all agree that the latter is assault it is also the only one of which not everything happened to me personally but even for that excuses are made yes it is a sliding scale but many if not nearly all things are doesnt someone have the right not to be touched when they dont feel comfortable with that touch is it not a normal thing to within reason abstain from using obscene language when youre not fairly sure the recipient is ok with that i think its basic respect not even just that i think its freedom and personal safety anyone should feel safe in college not saying tumblrina ban all the things just saying that when someone tells you theyre not ok with something its safe to assume they prefer if youd try tone it down to a reasonable extent of course not start to argue whether or not theyre allowed to feel that way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so which ones are idiots the ones who report it or the ones that dont
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actaully he has said that are idiots
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i suppose nawalt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,isnt that the number of cases that result in convictions or is that number even smaller
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,about nonconsensual touching i dont think most women are hysterical about that some women clearly have a political agenda of course and seek to piggybag rape to forward their cause not being enough actual rapes theyve been forced to inflate the number with nonrelated issues this is so standard political activism and the outcome equally predictable the watering down of actual rapes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theyre trying to teach the betas that they are unwanted and only want to be looked at and approached by alphas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,years spend in miserable anguish because they got drunk and stoned and he had his hand in her knickers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nonconsensual sexual touching is in fact a form of sexual assault and this is why the terms rape and sexual harassment have lost their meaning and have become the butt of jokes i was at a cookout and this lady grabbed me and went for a kiss and i pulled away so youre saying that was sexual harassment bc it was nonconsensual touching rhetorical that is just insane
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,did you read the study the questions specifically state that nonconsensual touching includes kissing touching someones genitals or ass or chest and rubbing in a sexual way it says nothing about hand touching
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,example watch the video of trumps campaign manager assault that reporter as he flings her around like a rag doll
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they arent mixing up terms you are they are using the term sexual assault because it isnt on the same level as rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good say
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape forceful penetration what a rational person would describe as sexual assault and not just any unwanted sexual contact edit i believe the rate of per as reported by the government to be accurate which over years adds up to less than and i live near a small college town and lets just say for arguments sake there are approximately women i could believe that approximately once per month there is a woman somewhere in the entire city had sex while she was too drunk to consent got pinned down and raped by her date or even some kind of rare random violence perhaps once a year in the city what most people think of when they think of sexual assault underage drinkers people not used to alcohol asshole dudes occasionally shit happens its a small town people talk bad stuff sometimes happens there are parties every weekend every so often someone will do something stupid even if you include guy is so drunk he ignores a woman when she says no and so she screams for help yea about once a month in that smallish town seems about right if the figure was women would raped every single day in my small town thats not happening its just not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,aau found that less than of the most serious sexual assault offenses like forcible penetration were reported to campus title ix offices or law enforcement agencies they were also looking more for touching sexual areas and being touched with sexual areas than a whoops im sorry how much outrage porn are you reading a day sure there are women who abuse their partners by playing victim for attention but not nearly as many as the altright claims
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but youre free to explain why lightly grazing someones butt for a second or two is the same crime as groping a womans breasts touching her crotch and attempting to french kiss her so its not sexual assault if the perpetrator claims it was only a light graze and only lasted a second or two
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,everyone gets touched inappropriately in their life its not really that big of a deal is that what youd tell your kids
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no you were counted in the group of those sexually harassed because this is a definition of sexual harassment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have to say yes to one item in both lists for it to count so someone has to for example try to get you to talk about sex when you dont want to and it has to interfere with your academic or professional performance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if it interferes with my academic performance yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know bp is fucked when they wordtwist rape into anything womyn feelz is rape is rape no shortage of strawmans and absurd hyperboles there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a verbal assault is harassment assault is a physical term thats how its defined legally
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a percentage of the former
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incredibly poor use of sarcasm you either dont understand awalt or you only want to convince morons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was referencing that the rate of reported incidents is per students per year so over years it would be just shy of
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it not only strengthens their cause but i once heard it could be a rape fantasy gone out of control by some rather unattractive women who wish men would be willing to break the law to bang them so theyre projecting onto men what they wish the world was a whole bunch of men who find them so attractive theyre willing to break the law to get into their panties
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres some truth to that teach guys more game unwanted attention becomes wanted attention assault reports go down long before a beta assaults a woman theres clear signs of disinterest in them as a sexual partner well clear if you know what to look for i guess poor fucking bastards sold this lie that unattractive qualities are attractive and end up fucking up miserably by acting on that bad information
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,forced kissing is neither sexual harassment which is usually milder nor rape but it is sexual assault words mean things it is not sexual assault according to the definitions used in this study although it may be attempted sexual assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it actually specifically distinguishes between kissing and touching someones ass and chest and sexually touching over clothes where it does not specify what sort of touching this actually is touching someones breast chest crotch groin or buttocks grabbing groping or rubbing against the other in a sexual way even if the touching is over the others clothes i would be interested to know what exactly this entailed if it was not touching of the breast chest crotch groin or buttocks is rubbing someones shoulder sexual assault if so this would probably explain why over of the women surveyed found that the action in questioned wasnt serious enough to report
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that was so ridiculous she lied through her teeth and bitches and white knights still took her side
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,stalking and harassment are not sexual assaults
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i hate to break it to you but youre not actually the arbiter of definitions sexual assault rape they are two different but related concepts just like assault and murder
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nice selective quoting are going to teach your kids to be a doormat or a someone who defends themselves and their boundaries you tell people to fuck off when they do shit like that if they keep doing it you escalate thats what you teach them to be confident defend themselves establish clear boundaries not to be part of some passive pussified collective of victimhood
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thank god i dont have to live in that shithole of a country where dirty jokes qualify ad sexual harassment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the surveys definition of sexual assault ranges from sexual harassment stalking and intimate partner violence to nonconsensual penetration and nonconsensual touching cant you read or do you merely choose not to when its inconvenient
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok so when some frat guys i know used to boast about the girls they hooked up with at parties i didnt want to talk about sex because it made me feel jealous this used to effect my school work because i felt dull and depressed would you count this as sexual harassment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and where does it even specify that in your definition hint nowhere you just made it up arbitrarily because you realized its ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre just making shit up now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok but stalking can mean things likei dont know breaking into someones house to watch them as they sleep that would definitely be illegal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes the one who basically stated it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think they would report every incident like which girl even bothers to report nonconsensual touching
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so reported to police you mean
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i doubt that would happen because game works if theres something interesting about the guy physically teach betas to hit the gym and to take care of themselves with proper skin care grooming etc and then teach them game that way they will be able to get laid some
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,words mean things seriously if you think you got sexually assaulted a word that summons the image of a guy charging at you sweeping you off your feet and pinning you down because a guy at a club got a bit too close while dancing or because the dude who tried to flirt with you put a hand on your butt for a moment your adding to the dilution of the meaning of the word
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,words mean things hey thats upembaylisss thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,humping their legs rubbing breast against them forcing them to touch your crotch cmon use your imagination and assume good faith this is why the manosphere is considered paranoid by the left sometimes i miss hanging out in places where i dont need to spell out the obvious every minutes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i hate to break it to you but youre not actually the arbiter of definitions sexual assault rape they are two different but related concepts just like assault and murder this is exactly the point it is as if murder culture apologists have elided the difference between assault and murder they know only are murdered annually say so they collect figures for assault perhaps and then run the two terms together into a single continuum so that the second acquires all the opproprium of the first then they announce with great panache that are assaulted annually leaving the unattentive reader to conclude are murdered to general alarm they then widen the definition of assault to include threats aggressive language and even hostile glaring and invite the pubilc to think of the public are being murdered we should not tolerate this lazy intellectual corruption it is an assault on the mind in fact the first infamous figures coming out of the early did actually invite us to conclude that in had been sexually assaulted raped go check if taken seriously the current report gravely undermines the original claim we should now say in are only sexually assaulted but better then that we few who actually purport to care should stop being willfully stupid we really do know better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly which means you cannot include the figure for assault in with the figure for murder lets say of persons are assaulted in a certain area and are murdered you do not get to add the two figures together and say of people are getting murdered here you do not get to define rape the legislature does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to be confident defend themselves establish clear boundaries got it so what do they do when someone outweighs them by pounds and is not stopping
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i clicked through to the actual study and it looks like it was misreported for one thing almost half of people reported being sexually harassed which is much greater than in as best as i can figure they chose to report the sexual assault number but claim it was inclusive of sexual harassment shrug journalists never trust them to be able to read a study
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well they tried to get you to talk about sex when you didnt want to and it interfered with your academic performance so yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,these next questions ask about situations in which a student at or someone employed by or otherwise associated with said or did something that  interfered with your academic or professional performance  limited your ability to participate in an academic program or  created an intimidating hostile or offensive social academic or work environment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,isnt this pretty much bps modus operandi
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know breaking into someones house to watch them as they sleep ok then thats a forced breakin and trespassing on a private residence not sexual assault would definitely be illegal right but the problem with these studies is they are lumping all the shit one can think of into one category its not accurate to what its trying to prove it needs to change its title to something like percentage of women who experienced being a victim of some crime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats the third response to the same query are you drunk d
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the biggest reason given for not reporting is the person doesnt feel like its a crime but rather just annoying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah other than that were just guessing or going by self reporting with no investigation of cases reported to the police are dismissed because while the complainant is believed to be telling the truth the actions that they describe do not meet the definition of a crime thats the number of reported cases it makes sense that in unreported cases the percentage would be higher
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right because when a drunk guy in a club comes up and asks for a blowjob in the bathroom ewww gross omg right the same thing as raping you with his words women dont report it to the police and of them dont report it as sexual assault to survey takers later on but some do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah hitting the gym is a good idea always bump up that smv
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,legally in the state of california in which i live touching someones butt without their consent is misdemeanor sexual assault and you can be sent to prison i dont know what state youre in but i expect the laws are similar
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,touch my butt ill break the guys hand would you be ok with a man touching your butt and dont say no because im not gay if its unwanted its unwanted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre on the side who thinks a massive number of women are sexually assaulted and you think others are paranoid i think the people who come up with these stats are paranoid using them simply to justify said paranoia
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really humping their legs are men literally turning into dogs now rubbing breasts is already cateogrized by point number two and forcing them in their crotch isnt even included in this definition it more likely fits into the intimidation or threats of force category how in any way are any of those things obvious in fact they all sound pretty unrealistic do you think its more or less paranoid to assume that most of these probably dont actually believe they were sexually assaulted because they didnt actually feel violated or that women are all getting their legs humped by midgets apparently
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly more veterans commit suicide then women are raped but yet somehow we live in a rape culture and not a suicide culture and great analogy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i typed my response before reading your you have it covered much better than i do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was with you till your last sentence the legislature may define rape strictly for the purpose of the application of law but the general meaning attached to the term by the community of speakers of the language is of course independent of legislation it is the general meaning that is salient here no one is prosecuting on the basis of these reports they are however using them to apologise for rape culture and borrowing the opprobrium the public attaches to the general sense of rape in order to do so by eliding the meaning into a single continuum with sexual assault sexual harassment asking on a date someone who doesnt want to go and even glancing in the direction of a fat ass the rest of your comment is exactly the point im making
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for the time you tell people to fuck off when they do shit like that if they keep doing it you escalate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it looks like it was misreported no shit sherlock all over again we were then told in on campus were raped that was how it was reported go look up what it actually counted as rape and unbelievably it worked students of all this education known as the news will tell you in are raped some of them became presidents of the united states how woefully our instructors have failed to leave us to illinformed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats so dumb i cant even
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok fair enough i didnt see the dividing line but even then its still incredibly subjective and down to your own interpretation of what that means its your personal interpretation and victimhood that makes these issues into actual problems most of the time not everybody takes everything the same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a large and frightening strawman you have created there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you may see yourself out good day sir i said good day sir
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,legally in the state of california in which i live touching someones butt without their consent is misdemeanor sexual assault and you can be sent to prison which is quite frankly retarded i dont know what state youre in but i expect the laws are similar i am not a lawyer but if i am not mistaken german courts wouldnt sent you to prison for touching someones ass for a second or two a fine is more likely and also more appropriate though in the aftermath of the cologne incident feminists pushed for exactly that guess they had to compensate for their deafening silence when it came to the actual events
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres a difference between not being ok with something and sending the one who did it to prison over it depending on my mood and my relationship to the guy my reaction would vary from aaaw you if its a pal and we play gay chicken or hands off fag if its a pal amd we dont play gay chicken to displaying anger if its not a pal and i am in a forgiving mood to bitchslapping the dude if its not a pal and i am not in a forgiving mood but prison only an idiot wouldnt consider this a disproportionate response
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe shehe has never been to a dance club where scores of women are assaulted daily and then come back next week the horror
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how are women not getting sexually assaulted on a massive scale i think ive never been in a night club or at a concert without noticing some creepy weirdo grabbing random butts or tits
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,new survey suggests in women getting sexually assaulted in college is correct thoughts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont worry about it very few are up to my standard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so how do you escalate when you are a pound woman getting beaten and forceably raped by a pound man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,um you do realize that this was misreported in a way to make it look like there was less sexual harassment and assault on campus than what there really is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how else can they do the survey i mean theyre hardly going to include cases of offensive jokes that didnt interfere with ones academic performance or create a hostile environment thats not sexual harassment legally and im not sure its possible to create a onesentence nonsubjective definition of creates a hostile environment that doesnt exclude things that should be included include things that should be excluded or most likely both
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think a bullet to the chest is more appropriate than prison time although sending them to prison might result in them getting raped by a black guy with hiv so thats also good
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not sexual assault thats battery and rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,um did you read my first post in this thread
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i mean theyre hardly going to include cases of offensive jokes that didnt interfere with ones academic performance of course they are if you make the parameters of harassment an offensive story then guess what a whole bunch of people are going to check yes on that box no matter whether it was actually sexually harassment or not the definitions used here are too broad too vague and too unrealistic and ignore how any reasonable person would take the question and im not sure its possible to create a onesentence nonsubjective definition of creates a hostile environment that doesnt exclude things that should be included include things that should be excluded or most likely both then guess what its a bad question and an equally bad definition if harassment can be as vague as i didnt like what i saw and as as specific as he stalked me repeatedly sending me unwanted messages every day even i asked him to stop then theres a serious problem with your methodology
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one here is claiming that sexual assault rape stop making strawmen however people are allowed not to want to be sexually assaulted even if its not as bad as being raped being punched isnt the same as being murdered but youre allowed to not want either of them to happen to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape is sexual assault but not every sexual assault is rape you are twisting words around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes and you were wrong because you were taking a journalist at their word instead of clicking through to read the study yourself at which point you would have realized that this study was misrepresenting the sexual assault number as the sexual assault harassment ipv number
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right but one is far more severe than the other to use your own examples if i made a stat that said in people are punched in the face or murdered youd probably wonder why the fuck im even mentioning those two in the same study theyre not comparable as i said to biggerd if all you have to worry about is someone touching your ass you are very privileged
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you made a stat that said in people are assaulted i wouldnt go around moaning about how being punched isnt murder because no one is saying that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,again as i said to biggerd the definition of sexual assault used for this study is so loose that you can count literally anything if you look at comment where she lists everything they define as sexual assault even telling jokes is on there the parallel in your example would be to suggest that getting punched in the face and someone looking like theyre angry as they walk past you are the same thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sexual assault was defined as nonconsensual sexual contact by physical force threats of physical force or incapacitation thats a fairly standard definition comment was about sexual harassment not assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually it was defined to include coercion as well as sex after the person said no verbally or through body language
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,both are measured in this study potato patata
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and all the stuff i just said its measuring trivial nonsense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh no someone touched my bum thats literally rape it seems to me that youre the one trying to equate rape with trivial nonsense in this thread words like sexual assault and sexual harassment have specific meanings and it can be useful to measure their prevalence the only ones here who are exaggerating their significance are trying to create strawmen for some inconceivable reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if we are to agree that this study is measuring trivial nonsense not shit that actually matters like rape why does it matter at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hells bells that swole guy isnt swole hes absurd monster big the fit guy is swole
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,posts guy at greater ottermode which takes a year of lifting and good diet to achieve skinnyfit this is what we talk about with the expectations i bet if showed a picture of a guy at natty max looking dry as fuck at you would say that guy looked just toned and not big that swole big frame guy is going to be fucked up in a few years from all the gear and hgh hes running but at least he still looks like he lifts when he puts on a shirt unlike mr skinnyfit ignore the male models face its the body its really the face
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there was a survey i recall of what women preferred that was less than scientific but the top vote getter was like a bmi bf just from me eyeballing it so fit trim some muscles good definition but neither grondlike nor any striations or extreme definition the number guy was significantly beefier so maybe bmi or more with nice muscles but less definition and a more cuddly look i dunno maybe that was just farts in the wind the impression that i get is that younger girls like smaller guys with almost no fat like i live in asia but set that aside and just consider the physique on the other hand older women seem to like something more along the lines of who is heavier set both in terms of muscles and body fat so no exaggerated v shape ripped muscles or washboard abs but bigger arms and chest personally my ideal would be given that we are about the same height weight age and skeletal structure and folical issues but that is another story of course he was down to about for the death race movie and commented in an interview about how insane his rabbit food diet was while they were shooting so no one can realistically expect to look like that all the time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your example of swole is taking thousands upon thousands of dollars of anabolics and has been training for years upon years these are far better examples of swole and women love it men would do well to try to achieve as close a physique to the above examples women completely underestimate how difficult it is to acquire anything even approaching this true definition of swole they think training days a week for years and following a good diet will result in a juiced up bodybuilders physique completely warped view of the effort research and time required probably because of juiced up alist celebrities that transform their bodies in a matter of months for movie roles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if we edit your cmv to read most women say that they do not like swole men its accurate or if we limit the definition of swole to exclude muscular and only include totally jacked circus freak either one of those makes this cmv completely true but otherwise no a lot of women will say that they dont like muscular men but they like muscular men not comically large circus freaks just guys with nice chests and arms and a sixpack
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the examples you are using is the same as saying women do not like tall men and picking a as an ideal height and comparing him to a man your thinking in exaggerated terms jay cutler takes steroids year round no college athlete or frat bro or of gym bros do that women will find some where in the middle of these two appealing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you should probably understand the amount of effort involved just to look like the fit example the swole pic is just a roided freak who is flexing and probably weeks out from a competition nobody looks like him unless its their career or passion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that swole guy is absurdly big steroid hgh years of monster inhuman workout big no fucking body can get that big so stfu heres swole and even this guy is pushing it in the swole department
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh its this again hi im a girl and i think big muscles are gross this posts picture a of mr olympia champion oiled up and spraytanned for posing contest is like sooooo gross this posts picture b of jacked and moderately huge bodybuilder in relaxed state is sexy its fit but not like bodybuilder gross he doesnt have like big muscles guy in picture b is lbs bodyfat and is a giant compared to most men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if your assertion was true then buff guys would get little to no action thats obviously not true though your response would likely be something like well most girls say they dont like a lot of muscle even if that was actually true that still doesnt mean much because they could just be saying that for a variety of reasons the main one i would think is that theyre not going to bother showing interest in men they dont think they have a chance with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,false eitheror in my experience some women really dig muscly men and some women dig twinky pretty boys and most women really prefer some blend of the two nobody digs superscrawny superbuilt or fatbodies when it comes to looks extremes are not desirable the best of both worlds is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,those descriptions are subjective i do not prefer that fit i prefer big boy swole not jay cutler but that fit is smaller than i am so naturally as a female who lifts that makes sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rpers say no amount of natural muscle looks bad and i agree with that some girls do like less muscly men for instance sandow will appear way too big for them but im pretty sure those guys get tons of mires from different gals and it all works out the swole guy you posted is obviously not natty and i doubt any terp has that sort of physique anyways men do care more about big muscles than women out of compliments they get will probably be from men lel how much do you bench bro
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,looks like we are again in need of some scientific data at your service as predicted women rate muscular men as sexier more physically dominant and volatile and less committed to their mates than nonmuscular men consistent with the invertedu hypothesis of masculine traits men with moderate muscularity are rated most attractive consistent with past research on fitness cues across two measures women indicate that their most recent short term sex partners were more muscular than their other sex partners ds across three studies when controlling for other characteristics eg body fat muscular men rate their bodies as sexier to women partial rs and report more lifetime sex partners partialrs shortterm partners partial rs more affairs with mated women partial
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok the swole guy looks like a body builder not your typical muscular man that being said the fit guys body is more attractive to me that even a typical muscular man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ignore the male models face its the body most women find that body type more attractive lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,usipssparklingwater you made this way to fucking easy most women find guys with a fitatheltic body to be the most appealing its often not guys and a handful of women that push the whole swolemeat head look
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im going to go ahead and say women always love someone more muscular than the one you called fit and obviously less than the one you called swole now the face is important too no matter what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you have any more evidence for this besides this is my opinion seems like youre basing a broad generalization on anecdotal data mixed with your personal opinion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well i could be in the minority but personally i do go for bigboy bodybuildertype swole keep in mind most bodybuilders dont walk around competition shredded with a striated butt year round lol i am not attracted to that fit example at all hes a skinny guy who needs to lift more i had an ex that competed he commented once that the leaner he got the more it was men that stared than women lol i had another male competitor friend who was a stripper and when he started getting too freaky lean they made him stop stripping because apparently most girls didnt like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol this again let me explain it for everyone once again though im sure this will keep coming up again and again nonetheless when a guy says he wants to become swole in most cases what he is actually referring to is your fit example what most women dont understand is how much work your fit example actually takes to achieve trust me that guy lifts a lot and probably uses protein supplements most guys who lift would love to have a body like his your swole example is a hardcore body builder who does the roids though i agree your fit example is probably closer to most womens ideal i wouldnt doubt that the swole example gets his share of pussy as well overall you are correct that most womens ideal is closer to your fit example what im not sure you understand is how much effort is required to achieve a body like this and the fact that most guys on trp are actually striving for a body like this one not one like your swole example
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lot more women in reality are more attracted to a skinnyfit man or something along those lines since you provided zero data to back up your view im going to translate your women to i
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont have much to contribute besides agreement and anecdata i have a male friend whos always been very fit and had an attractive body we havent seen each other in a few months due to conflicting schedules but i bumped into him at a barbeque a week or so ago hes always been a very muscular fitness buff but even before we started chatting about it i noticed hed gone basically from photo to photo and the result just wasnt appealing it was distracting and he almost looked more like a chariature of a bodybuilder rather than someone i had spent significant time with perhaps it was that he didnt quite look human anymore but it almost reminded me of some sort of fitnessspin on the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiuncannyvalley rather than a personality and face i had some familiarity with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women in general women in general have very diverse tastes in body types same as guys do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol yes that is what ive been saying all along its mostly men who find the bodybuilder to be attractive male models have the perfect body type to go with what most women find sexually attractive in men add that perfect face smile and height and a lot of panties come off whenever they wander into a nightclub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,abs and arms women typically like defined versions of those in guys steroids are a completely different thing get abs and arms through natural hard work and eating right and life gets much more enjoyable for a heterosexual male
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly i dont know why tbp seems to assume fit guys either look like professional bodybuilders or runners but nothing in between most men need more muscle on their frame not less
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,here is what you get when you just maybe trp doesnt know what it means
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermswole
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also the fit guy looks like a model and the bulky guy like the missing link
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fit guy is absolutely not swole hes barely even muscular
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this mr ottermode isnt natural and his body wasnt effortless
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most people dont have a fucking clue about fitness and weight training they see hot guys and think they were shat out their mothers womb like that people in general have an aversion to considering all the hard work that goes into success they prefer the hollywood montage and the effortless james bond approach not a proper diet and exercise regime over many monthsyears
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,any study on female attraction to males would have to control for what portion of their cycle they were on to even be considered
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,probably because of juiced up alist celebrities that transform their bodies in a matter of months for movie roles which they do as their literal job with a team of nutritionists and personal trainers being paid thousands by a movie studio to get the celebritys body to that point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ugly bad teeth and a gut rectangular body
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure not eating and having a pretty face thats basically it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would find him attractive but the duck face kills it to me swoll looks tasty but bizarre like butt implants on a girl or chocolatecovered bacon on an otherwise runofthemill cupcake id try it for the novelty and id probably like it but that doesnt mean i think it looks healthy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eck nope not for me i like fit that guy is veiny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ugh look at that facial expression hes a girl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i do not find that attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ew
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a dude thats well beyond a ffmi of that aint swole either by any standard outside bodybuilding circles a dude that big walking down the stretch would be turning heads due to his freaky muscularity a person who could easily compete in the mr olympias of the and isnt swole its well beyond swole
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,guy in the second picture would be at the most assuming he is tall and has a realisticachievable physique for most men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the second guy is nowhere near or bf this guy is and on the left and on the right he obviously has more muscle mass than the model yet weighs less than what you think the model weighs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this thats the look the most popular athletesfrat brosgym bros have its lean but good thick muscle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i definitely think the fit guy would get more action than the swole guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,womendontknowhowmalefitnessworkstxt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think many people at trp are aiming for guy guy is where we want to be at you agree with trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp doesnt really give specifics into how defined you should be but i would think more along the lines of which imo is still kind of small
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also agreed women do like varying amounts of muscle some more than others but i think its a very small group of women attracted to the bodybuilder type more muscle is not always better and it wouldnt be surprising to find that more superficial women are attracted to more muscular men so if youre not looking for someone like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed women want a man with the swimmers body pretty abs broad shoulders nice chest
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly guy even looks a bit too lumpyodd but the first guy is just scary whatever makes you happy with yourself though right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i definitely dig scrawny check out my post history i just posted a pic of my bf and i today and he is definitely scrawny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok the swole guy looks like a body builder not your typical muscular man yes thats jay cutler professional bodybuilder
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i enjoy your lol thank you kind sir
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the guy in the second picture definitely does a lot of strength training if this is so he would benefit from a lot more chest that being said hes hot and everybody knows that takes work
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well i could be in the minority but personally i do go for bigboy bodybuildertype swole just curious do you lift yourself asking cause i preferred skinny guys but since i started my likes have changed a lot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so basically he hopped on the juice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people have diverse tastes but we can also identify some trends cant we
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really most womens taste in mens fall in the picture both facially and physically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most men need more muscle on their frame not less exactly there absolutely is a point where youre more muscular than ideal for appealing to women jay cutler professional bodybuilder in the first picture whos taken tons and tons of steroids and other drugs to get that body in addition to dedicated training is past that point of men will not approach that point hell most men who go to the gym wont approach that point really the only demographic group that has to worry about that is people who take steroids and even thats no guarantee of going past that point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because of the comments we get get insisting that women find that lumpy deformed zyzz guy attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermswole extremely muscular or httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermbuff craig yo ray ray have you seen trey lately ray yeah hes been hittin the weights hasnt he craig yeah hes swole httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermdawg httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no reason to think the second one isnt natty if hes on gear he looks like absolute shit for it no chest pitiful lats no triceps etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and probably birth control if you want to be even more accurate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nutritionist personal trainers personal chef endocrinologists check out superman when he was and after he check out the blatant gyno in the after
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,face is irrelevant teeth are irrelevant if you think thats a gut then i dont know what to tell you what does the fit example have if hes stretching up and still has visible lower stomach fat nitpicking heres another a fantastic physique by any reasonable standard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i seem to be stalking you at the moment but they both have rectangular bodies theres no inverse triangle which is usually considered an attractive trait
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that fit guy has been lifting for at least years hes also been counting his macros for at least that long if his arms were down or flexed youd see the more of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and having good genes to begin with beyond the pretty face
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the veins on that dude are seriously freaky id be afraid id puncture a vein if i touched him ech
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,read the comments in his ig
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so veiny among other things me neither
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,edited comment to assist you with reading comprehension
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,acceptable though im not a fan of abs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,his chest appears smaller because of his arm position over his head heres some different picture of the same man in a different position his chest isnt huge but it sure isnt small or undeveloped
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,asking cause i preferred skinny guys but since i started my likes have changed a lot its like a person starting to like luxury cars once they start driving them and hanging around people who drive them we always adapt to better options that are available
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i do and im the same the more i lift myself the more what i like an am attracted to has changed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly theres still the strict diet beings weeks out from a competition genetics that go into that swole pic theres maybe a handful of people that can look like jay let alone even aspire to look like jay cutler
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah that is one of the reasons i think people swing so far the other way if we take the absurdity and balance it out women probably like guys with a decent bit of muscle who dont live at the gym but dont keel over during a round of enthusiastic sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im pretty sure when pem says natural in quotes he me and that guy didnt get that physique by playing sports with his friends twice a week and drinking beer all day
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,absolutely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hard to see when he has his shirt on but i think i see what you mean he looks soft in the second photo ive always thought of heavyweight mma fighters when i think swole they usually arent cutting the kind of weight the lbs guys are i dont think women overall like the juiced bodybuilder but most would probably think your examples are attractive so men should lift weights and grapple i guess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes not fat but chunkier than i prefer ottermode is the best none of these guys have good v shaped torsos
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,number looks rectangular from the front but angle and pose are both factors you mean to tell me that isnt at least a physique
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not necessarily true a good percentage of men can achieve that body in a fraction of that time some even have a better body with minimal exercise and minimal attention to diet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,leave planet fitness before its too late
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your gym sucks bro not sure what else to tell you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,does he have big brother if so id top him guys who are that preoccupied by their appearance make better subs than they do doms
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never said all people dont find it attractiveonly that i dont just like some people find the bodybuilder type of swole attractive different people find different things attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i just happen to fall within a group of women that dont find that kind of body type attractive some women do some women dont
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i dont like defined muscles particularly abs and he looks like a moron seriously does he make that stupid face in every picture too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah so youre not talking specifically about the pictures posted fair enough i would usually agree with the point youre making but in this case that model guys physique is very achievable with bodyweight training and calorie control
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is this the same guy i still think his chest looks a little underdeveloped relative to his arms and abs thats a matter of opinion though im not representing this as fact
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the maximum amount of muscle a beginner lifter with absolutely freaky genetics is pounds of muscle per month the more muscle a person adds to their frame the less the return on their effort month to month diminishing returns basically it sounds like your friend has been working out for a while before he transformed into the hulk in less than a year i am sure he started taking steroids judging by your description its not unimportant a lot of men have warped expectations about their effort in the gym because of guys surreptitiously juicing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly i didnt realize how much work it took even to be a little swole until i started lifting regularly most people probably dont realize that but the funny thing is how it becomes more enjoyable as you get into it reminds me of when i was or so i started lifting but quit after a few weeks because i didnt see any results and rationalized it with the skinny equivalent of fat logic by assuming i just couldnt build much muscle since some of my friends packed it on without a lot of work thanks to insane genes i dont have when in reality i wasnt letting different muscle groups rest properly wasnt eating enough and most importantly didnt keep up with it sure genes play a role in everything but not to the extent that theyll negate laws of thermodynamics anyway started again at and havent stopped for anything other than injuries which have admittedly held me back a lot—i lost a lot of muscle due to multiple injuries—but i doubt most people notice the muscle my body and think i put that much work into it of course i couldnt care less about that but its just an interesting assumption because im not that big but still do days a week for hours and i know me probably wouldve expected me to be far larger by now i forget who said it but while you may start working out with women in mind youll eventually grow to do it for yourself because you love it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill leave you and zyzz alone together now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he means
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah okay that makes a lot more sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not everyone has a slim waist these guys just have different genetics than that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair enough its just the imprecise use of language that bugs me a little the guy is very lean dont know in what world anybody would describe him as having a gut or chunky hes no more than bf which is leaner than of gymgoers thats a flat stomach with some definition and hed have a visible six pack if he flexed his core again though i wont tell you what you specifically find attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chunky he has visible abs wtf
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for me no maybe full body probably a little lower hes definitely not my type
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope nope nope the crushing majority finds that physique absolutely hot like extremely hot and even the ones that say that they dont get extra wet when they meet such a person face to face youre either just saying this or youre part of the of women not attracted to it ill go with the first choice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre probably a lesbian anyway i dont know why you chose that as your insult but nope just not into really muscly guys or aggressive guys which tend to have some overlap there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just dont see how your one opinion is relevant when there are dozens of women drooling over the pic in his comments clearly that is attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,seems like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yup check the url of the images some agency same dude
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the maximum amount of muscle a beginner lifter with absolutely freaky genetics is pounds of muscle per month would you happen to know what this figure is for women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes and body building cant compensate for that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but his abdomen bulges outward in an unattractive way hence my use of the term gut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bear mode is chunky its about distance round his waist not fat level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well to be fair he doesnt put effort into his body for vanity hes a top poundfor pound mma fighter and the youngest ufc champion in history a genetically elite superathlete basically guarantees women would be ogling him if they saw him on the beach if he had a more handsome face like say ryan reynolds then youd be singing a different tune i suspect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,denial rant its okay for people to like different things without being some sort of anomaly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,crushing majority please provide a source for that data show that the average woman prefers and bmi of around which is borderline overweight identifies the only consistency with physical appearance in regard to attractiveness to women is the mans chest to stomach ratio and they wanted that ratio to be smaller but this was only to be found true for women with attractive volume height index meaning generally attractive vhi women prefer men that do not have a large chest compared to a small stomach or vice versa again middle of the road on that particular body measurement but not consistent in anything else or all women for that matter and as for your assertion on my motives or what i truly find attractive youre entitled to you opinion its wrong but youre welcome to keep thinking it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is too funny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so a dozen comments from women drooling over a guy online clearly means well all women find him attractive not exactly scientific
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just dont see how your one opinion is relevant debate sub thank you for reminding me why i quit posting here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,permanent duckface and overly muscled no thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not saying i wouldnt hit it maybe im just a chest gal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are basically women on steroids with a near optimum regimen a woman can expect to gain pounds her first year of serious training half that the next year and then half the following one so about a pound of muscle per month doesnt sound like much but it adds up think of what one pound of lean steak looks like edit also the more muscle the more fat you can get away with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it certainly can to an extent developing lats medial delts and neglecting the obliques will definitely help in shifting the ratio its mostly bodybuilders and a small percentage of women discussing the perfect body who really care about having a pronounced taper even if the shoulders are wider than the waist most women dont even know what theyre looking at half the time and are perfectly content with a guy who has a lowenough bf and a balanced physique with broad shoulders
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol the comment thread was about fitness standards not genetics troll harder
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pretend you just finished a heavy workout youre sweaty and tired youre breathing heavily there you go its called inhaling you are also likely mistaking the sharp lines of his for a belly which is ironic because thats an indicator of leanness in addition to the noticeable veins in his shoulders and arms now i feel weird defending the guys body thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some guys are just structured that way no matter how lean they are more boxy than triangular
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bmi of around which is borderline overweight ya bmi is crap to say the least the thing thinks i am borderline obese yet miles from it but it says that primary because i am on the tall side so my weight is higher
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,based on the chest to stomach ratio hypothesis the swole bro should be way more attractive than the fit guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,average women lol who cares what do above average and hot women say is hot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well everyone has their own opinion of what excessively muscular is barring extremes that most everyone would agree on i know what mine is and thats good enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wo said all women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the debate isnt about what you find attractive its about what is attractive and considered attractive by most people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is this when im supposed to give you shit for objectification lol not really my type either i must admit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thanks wherever i read it it usually just mentioned the number without specifying if it was for both sexes or what hope you dont mind me asking i went from bench press to same in like a month and have stalled there would you say thats the extent of noobgainz for women or do i need to adjust something usually i cant hit protein lb of bodyweight more like is that completely stopping my progress or just slowing it down
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,isnt a taper the one most wanted thing women look for in all cultures
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thread drift yeah being fit is usually better than being fat then it turns a corner and gets disgusting again chubby and bear mode are equal distances from being attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,still not attractive whether its their fault or not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no question that there are different tastes i just noticed women seem almost entirely incapable of objectively assessing aesthetics too many variables involved for them its why they ogle a guy like ryan gosling with his childbearing hips status facial attractiveness perceived attractiveness to other women etc all warp their expressed opinion abut physiques ive seriously learned to never trust what women say about body ideals but rather observe their authentic reaction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the other study also took into account other variables including heightvolume ratio that showed no significantconsistent correlation of what women find attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not what the study says at all please refer to my comment as i explain it or here it is straight from the article there was less evidence of condition dependent variation in preferences among females females with more attractive vhi showed stronger preferences for attractive low wcr in male targets however no other female rater characteristics whr selfperceived attractiveness or sociosexuality were significant predictors of strength of preference for attractive male vhi or wcr
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wo didnt say that sorry couldnt resist its very much implied by the trp who replied in this comment chain tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if youre being downvoted dont look at me i havent downvoted anyone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is attractive is subjective i have also linked studies in this thread that dispute that all most women like a specific body type
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not really interested in the objectification concept when it comes to attraction but its not really productive to assign the most extreme examples of each side when it isnt pertinent to the topic at hand that would be like me asking if i said i would be willing to have a one sided sexual exchange with this guy that culminates in smeering period blood on his face but would kick him out before he gets off because im the prize and his chest gives him points would you upvote me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it depends are you eating at a caloric surplus if youre eating at maintenance or below then strength gains will be much much slower judging by your protein intake im guessing youre not eating at much of a surplus if at all noob gains is a broad term that refers to the rapid adjustment that your nervous system makes resulting in a quick and early jump in strength a brief period where muscle gain occurs regardless of caloric intake after a person first starts working out and the relatively rapid muscle gain that occurs when a person first starts adding muscle to their frame while they eat above maintenance im guessing youve merely moreorless cashed in the first two components if your weight remains fairly steady over the next couple of weeks or so or you intuitively know that it will try adding a small meal or a decentsized snack to your diet if youve already been eating maintenance know that progress isnt perfectly linear one can only really say theyve stalled out if strength has remained the same for something like weeks good luck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,noob gains dont end in a month
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure the number example that i gave has a taper but i dont know what the physical advantage of having a taper from the front is there is no functional advantage as far as i can tell lebron james who is arguably one of the greatest athletes of all time in terms of raw physical output speed coordination power is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is no hard set rule for women in what they generally find universally attractive physically unlike with men where there is the my point was more than the bmi by and large is useless and crap especially on an individual level and barely useful at all at a macro level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well now youre just making stuff up based on nothing i dont know why youre so personally actively hurt by women having varying preferences but its the way of the world so i hope you find a way to live with it someday
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah this is a problem can we trust you to track the cocks for us
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,post as many flawed studies as you want the bottom line is do you think hes getting laid easily or not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was being silly to be honest no worries
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,were strictly talking body you will never or maybe very rarely see a guy say anything about a womans other features if the conversation is about body were not so easily distractedsidetracked by other factors i dont doubt that you dont find the guy hot overall
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bmi isnt helpful if youre an athlete or weightlifter due to it not controlling for lbm if youre an average couch potato its not bad though still not really great
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is no hard set rule for women in what they generally find universally attractive physically this this is all ive been saying yet others on here have debated the complete opposite unlike with men where there is the magic hip to waist ratio this was also confirmed by the second study i linked point was more than the bmi by and large is useless and crap especially on an individual level and barely useful at all at a macro level im no expert so i cant argue one way or another on that particular point i appreciate the insight on bmi ill have to look into it further
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your bottom line doesnt prove that most women like that type of body im sure he does get laid but thats hardly valid proof that most women find it attractive too many confounding variables with humans and even if there is a correlation it doesnt equal causation if you find my studies flawed please post your own where are your scientific studies pointing to most women finding a specific body type attractive btw someone mentioned the bmi study as hard to identify an actual body type and i conceded the point whats wrong with the other
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this this is all ive been saying yet others on here have debated the complete opposite you have to keep in mind your dealing trp which is no different from tbp in that both sides no matter what evidence is shown are going to stick to their opinion no matter how wrong it is im no expert so i cant argue one way or another on that particular point i appreciate the insight on bmi ill have to look into it further do look into it i think you find even medical professionals having issues with it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well check this study out and i quote from the abstract evolutionary scientists propose that exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics are cues of genes that increase offspring viability or reproductive success in six studies the hypothesis that muscularity is one such cue is tested as predicted women rate muscular men as sexier more physically dominant and volatile and less committed to their mates than nonmuscular men consistent with the invertedu hypothesis of masculine traits men with moderate muscularity are rated most attractive consistent with past research on fitness cues across two measures women indicate that their most recent short term sex partners were more muscular than their other sex partners ds across three studies when controlling for other characteristics eg body fat muscular men rate their bodies as sexier to women partial rs and report more lifetime sex partners partial rs shortterm partners partial rs and more affairs with mated women partial r
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh goodie research though you have provided actually academic research yay for you there is a logic gap between the claim and what you are providing as evidence this in no way proves the assertion made by the previous commenter his claim was the crushing majority finds that physique absolutely hot like extremely hot and even the ones that say that they dont get extra wet when they meet such a person face to face youre either just saying this or youre part of the of women not attracted to it that study just proves on trend that many women can and do find muscles attractive not that all of them do furthermore the posted as the correct amount of swole to get the feeemales wet actually would fall closer to figure or on appendix b while the preference from females was fig so really we should be clarifying what exactly we mean by muscular or swole because if that photo is itit wasnt found to be the most attractive body type on that note your study further proves my point because two models of muscularity were rated with no significant difference meaning that women found other body types like toned just as attractive as muscular also shows similar results between muscular and average builds so no real consensus i would say more that there are multiple body types that attract females id also like to point out that an increase in muscularity was positively correlated to higher perceived volatility and lack of commitment both factors that are considered negatively in mate desirability for females but i guess that is off topici digress finally this does nothing to disprove my other study that showed that there were no predictors in women to tell what they would find attractive i am not discounting predisposition to finding certain traits attractive but the hyperbole of all women acting purely on primal instinct over muscles is ridiculous the only thing consistent about social science is that it is inconsistent humans are complex creatures and there will never be a onesizefitsall theory if you think there is you dont understand the field
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,apologies wasnt really aiming to demonstrate his claim my bad it was quite a lazy defense anyway heres my actual opinion im aware not all women like massive muscles but trp deals with trends because they are much more useful we go with the most bang for your buck sort of deal see also the originals commenters definition of swole i and many trpers think is ridiculous and unattractive my opinion of what is the best level falls around image and though is close to pushing it too far its hard to tell with the drawings and is pretty good too on appendix b which is where the study found the most attractive to be as well image and look roided and unattractive i suspect nearly all trpers would agree with me so its never really a problem the vast majority of men could do much better with a larger muscle mass also as far as the muscularity positively correlated to a lack of commitment it is because these men are seen by women on average as having more options and so are less likely to stick around ie the shortterm mating strategy type of the dualistic mating strategy for women not such a bad thing for men at all in my opinion in fact i think id like to be the guy who looks too good to commit if you want a study on that i have one too edit nevermind just grabbed a quote from the study already provided the findings of study show that women find mus cular men sexually attractive but believe they are less likely to be committed and the findings of study sug gest women prefer less muscularity in a longterm part ner these findings are consistent with the mating tradeoff hypothesis which suggests that women should have stronger preferences for men displaying cues to her itable fitness particularly when considering men as short term mates in parallel men possessing these cues may be more likely to pursue a shortterm mating strategy thus we predicted that womens past shortterm sex partners would be more muscular than their other longer term sex partners ie if you wanna be the guy she and her friends fuck at the drop of a hat be the muscular guy this is trp also if youre in a relationship and if you wanna be the guy shes still attracted to the most when shes ovulating be the muscular guy because women are more sexually attracted to shortterm mating strategy guys in this period of their cycle different study essentially womens preferences change at ovulation but if youre already her shortterm mating strategy type in looks as well youre safer and her attraction wont shift to other men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,apologies wasnt really aiming to demonstrate his claim my bad it was quite a lazy defense alright then glad we can agree on something but i would like to point out that this is one of the reasons trp has such a bad rap some extremist trper makes an outrageous claim and cant back it up instead of realizing what was being discussed you jumped in to defend rescue all while you really didnt agree with the original statement this is how bad theory gets perpetuated and reiterated by someone that doesnt understand it anyway heres my actual opinion im aware not all women like massive muscles but trp deals with trends because they are much more useful we go with the most bang for your buck sort of deal see i can understand this position as well i whole heartedly agree that getting fit is in your best interest when attracting a mate it shows a lot about the person and many of those qualities are attractive discipline respect for oneself etc it is not however an isolated attribute that immediately makes the panties wet as the previous commenter described also the originals commenters definition of swole i and many trpers think is ridiculous and unattractive my opinion of what is the best level falls around image and though is close to pushing it too far its hard to tell with the drawings and is pretty good too on appendix b which is where the study found the most attractive to be as well image and look roided and unattractive i suspect nearly all trpers would agree with me so its never really a problem the vast majority of men could do much better with a larger muscle mass ok so here i start to see some problems i have seen a fair amount of rp posts over the last couple of years and i am not sure i agree with you while there might be difference in opinion i am not sure there is a vast majority on one side when the agreement on what attractive swole is cant even be agreed upon in the community how is it helping the members and if there is a large number of trps that dont agree with you on your definition of swole would not the theory actually hurt them as the over built muscularity is not attractive to the opposite sex also as far as the muscularity positively correlated to a lack of commitment it is because these men are seen by women on average as having more options and so are less likely to stick around ie the shortterm mating strategy type of the dualistic mating strategy for women not such a bad thing for men at all in my opinion in fact i think id like to be the guy who looks too good to commit this is where my confusion with trp lies it is a self fulfilling prophecy there is the anger stage about how all women are riding the cc and how trp prefers women that are purewomen who didnt waste their youth jumping from one cock to another and then later decide they want a provider there is a minority of trp that has this toxic mindset about treating those sexual women like the whores they are all while they are being used for the same holes causing them ridicule and at times often detailed in frs the manipulation and abuse inflicted on them trp would never consider settling with a cc rider but also choose never to seek out companionship with higher quality ltr material i get it as a sexual strategy but what is the problem with these women if they are giving you exactly what you want and actually are in the same mindset of yourself why the hypocrisy when the strategy itself is based on being one of the horses on the cc edit nevermind just grabbed a quote from the study already provided the findings of study show that women find mus cular men sexually attractive but believe they are less likely to be committed and the findings of study sug gest women prefer less muscularity in a longterm part ner these findings are consistent with the mating tradeoff hypothesis which suggests that women should have stronger preferences for men displaying cues to her itable fitness particularly when considering men as short term mates in parallel men possessing these cues may be more likely to pursue a shortterm mating strategy thus we predicted that womens past shortterm sex partners would be more muscular than their other longer term sex partners ie if you wanna be the guy she and her friends fuck at the drop of a hat be the muscular guy this is trp i saw this while reading the article and thought you might mention it i really have never debated this my one comment about it earlier was based on ltr attractiveness i guess that was just my own bias showing through when i was typing i havent thought about a shortterm relationship in a looooong time if you want the girls looking for shortterm sex i get there is a correlation though i dont know about the evo psych babble at the end and i wish they would have controlled variable within the women populations tested i would have liked to see if there was a significant difference between women and their choices not that it would have really mattered in this debate i would just be curious also if youre in a relationship and if you wanna be the guy shes still attracted to the most when shes ovulating be the muscular guy because women are more sexually attracted to shortterm mating strategy guys in this period of their cycle different study essentially womens preferences change at ovulation but if youre already her shortterm mating strategy type in looks as well youre safer and her attraction wont shift to other men i would love to see a realworld experiment article discuss how much this really affects the actions and decisions of a woman every article i could find was small deviations and only recreated in lab settings i have seen no proof that a woman is a slave to her fertility i have never once thought to myself while ovulating man my slender nonmuscular husband just isnt very attractive today but man that guy doing lb squats over there is boy these hormones are making me want muscles now i need to ride that cock ok all jokes aside there is a lot of more serious issues that contribute to acting on or just the though of cheating on your so maybe this plays a small part i cant say no but i havent found a study that shows the actual effect of the gaze shifting slightly during fertility not to mention wouldnt you not want to be attractive during ovulation lord knows it is just one step away from trapping you with a baby s seriously though thanks for the well thought out and insightful discussion i rarely have a civilized conversation or ppd i do understand parts of rp theory and believe they can help a person be more successful with the other sex i never argue it doesnt what i dont appreciate is the vitrol and hate that some users and mods spew about women which is then promptly soaked up like a sponge into young users that dont understand they hyperbole and generalizations made are often damaging when a user cant understand that awalt doesnt necessarily mean awalt it breeds hate and contempt while actually widening the gap of understanding between the two sexes but i guess thats not what rp is all about those consequences dont matter it doesnt matter that these women are people with thoughts and feelings all rp is teaching is how to get up in that hole rp is a sexual strategy and it is immoral right thats what everybody keeps saying but i just dont see it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,on how muscular trp pushes muscularity i guess well have to agree to disagree trying to figure out which one of us is correct would probably be never ending about the anger stage and cc and such i personally am not angered at all by what anyone malefemale chooses to do and i think your correct about there being hypocrisy in trp one second theyre raging about the terrible cc riders the next moment theyre doing the same thing they claim its because there are no good women but their emotions dont really fit that narrative anyway im simply pointing out that if youre going to try to get the best members of the opposite sex the best thing to do would be to make your smv as high as possible id like to be near unattainable not because i dont want to date anyone but because i want options also the reason why i am a fan of trp is they actually provide another side to viewing women of course they often go overboard but the general populationmediaetc seem to have a ridiculously high opinion of women and they often take a can do no wrong opinion of them when its clearly not the case regarding the behavioral shifts in women during ovulation i have a bunch of studies belowa few are of varying relevance but oh well also im not claiming women are a slave to their fertility or sexuality neither are men the point of this evolutionary psych research is to find trends in mating behaviours and saying you dont notice changes in your behaviour during ovulation doesnt mean there isnt any of course you said you were joking but i just wanted to make that clear to give you a male example of an equally ridiculous statement i dont look at womens lumbar spine curvature and tell myself oh boy look at that lower spine that curvature is just perrrfect for the load bearing required for pregnancy better go bust a nut in that chic fast and yet thats what my brain somewhere is telling me when i check out a womens rear end btw thats a recently discovered attraction cue for males heres the interesting study i have a bunch more about ovulation and also about how men respond to ovulating women but it is beginning to be quite cluttered lol anyway hope the links work httpwwwsscnetuclaeducommhaseltonwebdocsdresstoimpresspdf
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive noticed more day to day variation for any given woman than between women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes every vagina is different no obvious correlation with the size of the woman either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there have only been vaginas out of the ive been in that were all that different one was a girl who was so loose i couldnt even tell i was in there i had to have her finish me off with her mouth every time this girl had no kids and i have no idea what the deal was the other was so tight her pussy was tighter than her ass and when i said this she claimed to have a medically diagnosed narrow vagina her obgyn said shed have to deliver via c section when she had babies they were both pretty slutty i dont think getting pounded by lots of dicks even big ones makes a difference in vaginal tightness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have never noticed any difference in tightness whatsoever however it must be said that when im in the sexual act my state of mind isnt particularly contemplative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes like night and day difference there were women with whom i literally was unable to come from piv alone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yesno two are the same smaller girls are generally tighter but thats not universally true vaginal births make a huge difference but its not exactly mulplicative in that vaginal births dont result in reduced tightness id say every kid after the first decreases tightness by about i will also say that there is no substitution for youth when it comes to vaginas they look worse the older they get
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,runners have the tightest or weightlifters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,neither my husband nor i have noticed an appreciable difference in tightness pre or post pregnancy however ive religiously practised kegals since i was and pilates since i was currently the vagina is a muscle tied to the pelvic floor and like most other muscles it can be strengthened with targeted exercise
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yup some women got the grand canyon going on others are like squeezing your dick through a penny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,every vagina i have ever felt has felt different most times ive slept with the same girl has felt different depending on how into it she was at the time smaller framed girls have generally felt tighter but not to any extreme number of sexual partners has never seemed to have any correlation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can only answer for myself no it hasnt become looser with age or the births of my children and they were vaginal births i was supertight as a virgin but that was due to a thick hymen and made the first attempts at sex horrible so painful that i was tightening up due to the pain sex was just about impossible at that point and i pretty much thought i was going to hate penises for the rest of my life after having kids my vagina is different some scar tissue from tearing and it looks a little more open than before but in terms of tightness i feel no difference at all i pretty much masturbate daily besides having sex and i think a side effect of all that vaginal spasming on a penis or dildo is a workout and keeps it conditioned my partner comes far more quickly during piv than anything else he has to hold himself back during piv so that i get to enjoy it for longer some days am tighter than others it feels looser during a period etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no kids very tight or so says my year old boyfriend
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes but its usually a function of the womans overall physical conditioning not whether shes had kids or how many kids women who are in good shape not overweight and who do some kind of physical exercise tend to keep relatively snug tight pussies women who are overweight flabby and who dont exercise have somewhat looser vaginas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mine seems essentially the same based on how things still feel to me but im only and no kids so i guess well see
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive had sex a lot not with a lot of partners but if i go over a week without sex my vagina tightens up so much i cant have sex without taking magnesium supplements and getting juiced up ive been this way since i lost my virginity almost years ago
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive had a woman with a vagina so loose it felt like i was just dipping my penis in warm water or something ive also felt really tight ones which feel better the difference is easily noticable like another poster said i also have a tough time reaching orgasm with a loose vagina and if a condom is involved with said loose vagina orgasm is pretty much impossible for me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when you buy a menstrual cup which is like a new age tampon there are different sizes for people who had kids and people who havent there is no other real consideration i am not into those things because it is awkward to wash it in the bathroom at work but a lot of people like them because they are environmentally friendly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,out of vaginas i fucked one belong to a woman who already gave birth in the past not really a difference her vagina was more or less equally tight when compared to others
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,every twat is unique
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,younger women are typically tighter than older women women without children are typically tighter than women with children
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats an interesting take and ive noticed it too it hurts some days when im not particularly elastic other days its like throwing a salame in a corridor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wow thats new i never heard someone say that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha ur cut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really i never thought of vaginas getting old but i seen lots of older ladies down there as they certainly arent soft and puffy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my mum got so many stitches after giving birth to me that she said her vagina was the tightest its ever been lmao what sort of topic is that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do grand canyons make it less pleasurable do you take longer to climax
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my husband says that there is an absolute difference in tightness between women who have had children and women who have not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is still young
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wow how does magnesium help
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love them because they dont give me cramps like tampons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,guys arent assholes who publicly judge women for things they cant change we just fat shame mainly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all skin loses tightness and elasticity as it ages and the vagina is no exception women with pronounced external labia are worse off in this regard im fairly well endowed so ive never had a problem with too loose but too tight can be painful in the longterm coconut oil makes awesome lube btw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,depends as long as shes hot and knows how to fuck im gonna nut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he is absolutely correct
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh that sucks i was hoping it was a myth because its something many women try to hide but i better get doing some kegels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whereve you been
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for a woman its not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,magnesium also helps reduce painful menstrual cramps fyi
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do u wash it in a public bathroom tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah ive heard loose vagina shit just never not being able to climax needs more fat shaming though haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,coconut oil will destroy latex condoms tho so only use it when youre comfortable not wearing a condom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i used to have lube problem when i was on the pill but now its fair game anytime sometimes even without foreplay its awesome
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont talk with my dad about our dicks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think it is sometimes the case that it becomes tighter over time initially after childbirth it can be looser but then it can tighten up again in the following years i have read this anyway never having had a vagina nor given birth personally its hard for me to confirm or deny this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,c section ftw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its relatively young for humans which includes women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for a woman its not from your perspective which doesnt matter to any woman on the planet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont really i dump it and put it back maybe wipe the outside with a bit of kleenex then wash it in the shower before bed it doesnt need to be washed thoroughly multiple times a day i do morning and night and it is good
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i had it happen with a single mother who obviously didnt get stitched up as well as most mothers bad gyno we dated for a year tried to get her into kegels but ultimately nothing worked she was just loose hell most mothers ive been with are actually indistinguishable from women without kids based solely on pussy tightness so she was a definite anomaly bigger than pussy tightness if a woman is fat and i cant thrust all the way deep into her vagina is a bigger problem than tightness ive never once had a problem cumming with a slim chick and more single mothers tend to be fat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,apparently the amount of childbirths that are being delivered via this route is growing and findings have shown it to be impacting to the childs gut health down the line getting delivered through the vaginal canal aids with immune function because of what is in the bacteria
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its pretty close to ancient for women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no not sure how you come to that conclusion considering life expectancy for men and women ranges in the might be at the tail end of young at best closer to middle age in my opinion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not really an issue from the womens side but when discussing babies it concerns this topic if children are desired then its definitely more beneficial for the actual child that the mother gives birth before mid given the medical concerns that could present issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wouldnt it be kinda cool if my dad was your mother
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eh the twins and i would have died without a csection my husband would have died had his mother not had a csection and he had an older brother who did die at birth because she wasnt sectioned compared to that the benefits of improved gut health are very marginal indeed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only for bitter vengeful wishful thinkers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i came to that conclusion through common sense is not old or middleaged
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no personal attacks passive aggressive or otherwise consider this your first warning
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree likewise its more beneficial for the child that the father has his children before his midthirties many sperm banks even though they are short of sperm wont take sperm from men older then for that same reason and so is the same age for both men and women from any perspective
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,everyone says that though doc said my kids wouldnt make it without a csection truth is most docs push it because they can make a schedule that way sad but true fact from a nurse friend of mine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well common sense would tell you that people dont typically live past you should also consider that past is pretty much old and is nearly half way there is pretty close to middle age inthe grand scheme of things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont respond to personal attacks just report them next time it saves us trouble of removing entire chain and saves you from wasted effort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i delivered twins who were both footling breech no responsible ob would have let me deliver any other way than csection particularly with my history of uterine surgery mr arthurs cord was wrapped three times around his neck and he came very close to dying before his mom underwent an emergency section and again his older brother did die in exactly that way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well common sense would tell you that people dont typically live past you should also consider that past is pretty much old and is nearly half way there is pretty close to middle age inthe grand scheme of things if past is pretty much old how is also old this is just bad math even if i were only to live to is close to middle age not i dont know why this is either offensive or controversial is still relatively young if you heard on the news that a year old died from a tragic accident would you think they had lived a long full life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,apologies will ignore them in future
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course theres a time and a place for that operation but i find it hard to believe all of these girls are having the same or an equivalent to the problem that youve had
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never said was old i said it is fast approaching middle age if not already there i see middle age as a time span say than as a single age your question is intriguing though im now and many times i have thought if i died then that would be ok at the same time i know of a guy whos and has stage iv cancer who i feel really sorry for
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,probably not but maybe they want to avoid damage to their pelvic floor or a fistula i know somebody who got one it was not a party or tearing ive not seen any studies that indicate that the difference in gut health is so profound that it makes a discernible difference to the child later on in life so i dont fault any woman who wants to avoid any of those things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that field of studies are still in their infancy id rather my so go natural
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well the odds are in your favor that she will be able to do so should she wish to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if he was a workaday shmoe theyd never have met so the point is moot their rare accomplishments put them in each others social orbit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,would he be marrying her if she wasnt a rich and famous tennis star that is also a question that must be asked the red pill says a man like him would be seeking the youngest and prettiest wife he can and he doesnt give a brass razoo about her accomplishments or money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if serena williams met alexis ohanian and he had exactly the same looks personality and qualities that he has now but he merely posted on reddit instead of founding it had a decent professional career and made around per year approximately more than the median average would she have got engaged to him fuck no why because a huge part of smart money culture is protecting and increasing your wealth only a complete fucking idiot would marry that far down
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think this works both ways though hes not a badlooking guy hes ambitious successful and apparently has a net worth in the region of while serena is reasonably attractive a guy with these credentials could easily wife up a woman who is more physically attractive i just dont see why this concept of marrying for status is seen as oneway street when in examples like these the man is also marrying up as it were
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why the hell should he care
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope if i were a guy with his money i wouldve gone for someone better looking but i also understand that when you have money and status women probably throw themselves at you and you have probably had your desire for hot pussy fulfilled and might want someone whos not after your money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if alexis ohanian met a fit and extremely muscular black woman with lets face it a somewhat mannish face that needs careful cosmetic use to avoid looking downright horsey in her mid thirties and she had exactly the same looks personality and qualities that serena williams has now but she was an unknown tennis player who merely played recreational tennis instead of being a serious tennis celebrity had a decent professional career and made around per year approximately more than the median average would he have got engaged to her of course neither of them is going to be dating at random they arent idiots they each wanted someone who could bring them new contacts and more social status the people who seek out people like her arent the people who seek out people like him suddenly their combined friendship and professional contact network is huge
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she likes tech nerds and rolls in those richpeople circles idk theyre just a power couple hes got brains shes got athletic prowess itd be like if i bred with katie ledecky the kids wouldnt necessarily be the bestlooking but theyd be athletic champions and smart as whips
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no and if serena played twice year amateur local tennis who made medium salary would he be engaged to her no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,congrats this is really cool serena williams is already a millionaire though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,by comparison novak djokovic andy murray are married to their highschool sweethearts federer also met his wife ago it is kinda galling how few similar examples of that exist with women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she likely wouldnt because he would havent access to her social circle if he did have access to the social circle being a normal redditor she might have gotten with him i wouldnt mind dating a cool redditor myself we could ask the reverse would this dude engage serena williams if she was just your local hr lady who played tennis at the ymca for fun
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if serena williams met alexis ohanian and he had exactly the same looks personality and qualities that he has now probably not but shes pretty ugly though i dunno why he would want to marry her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,williams is worth million which means she is significantly wealthier than ohanian but according to the global rich list ohanian is ranked in the top on the planet in terms of wealth with under million people being wealthier than him its more about status the guy is at the top of the tech industry and she is at the top of tennis
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if serena williams met alexis ohanian and he had exactly the same looks personality and qualities that he has now but he merely posted on reddit instead of founding it had a decent professional career and made around per year approximately more than the median average would she have got engaged to him absolutely fucking no chance hed have more chance of giving birth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if he was a workaday shmoe theyd never have met so the point is moot lol no wealthy people meet more other wealthy people than poor people for sure but still the majority of people they meet are not wealthy she interacts with shit tonn of regular folks on waiters taxi drivers recaptionists barbers cashiers etc the fact that they are romanticly invisible to her doesnt mean they dont exist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if he was a workaday shmoe theyd never have met so the point is moot still would been possible but they likely not had any real chance to socialize or that really mingle and more so there be a clear as day social economic class difference neither one would have crossed as women by and large dont date down let alone a whole class down i say this as despite making shit i get to meet people and interact with people who are far far more wealthier than me i also live in an area where theres shit load of rich people as the county i live in makes up of the nations millionaires and the county next door which is just a tad bit more known hold of the nations millionaires
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a man like him would be seeking the youngest and prettiest wife he can and he doesnt give a brass razoo about her accomplishments or money black and pretty unfeminine im not gonna lie when i heard the news i got absolutely giddy imagining the new and exciting ways the pillosphere would try to spin this story
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,romance is supposed to be foolish for maximum effect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you forgot to mention he is way smarter than she is although this particular move may place some heavy doubt on that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im sure he doesnt care at all but i wasnt really asking him maybe hell drop by to claim that she likes him because of his personality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how can anyone be better looking than the gorgeous serena
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if alexis ohanian met a fit and extremely muscular black woman with lets face it a somewhat mannish face that needs careful cosmetic use to avoid looking downright horsey in her mid thirties and she had exactly the same looks personality and qualities that serena williams has now but she was an unknown tennis player who merely played recreational tennis instead of being a serious tennis celebrity had a decent professional career and made around per year approximately more than the median average would he have got engaged to her if her n count was
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,katie ledecky is way better than you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,itd be like if i bred with katie ledecky ive seen you shirtless brah yall are pretty evenly matched
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,married to their highschool sweethearts well this is just smart if you are rich and famous because if marriage is your goal you want someone who loved you before you were rich and famous else you have a high chance of getting fucked over by a gold digger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah ive cited this previously numerous male players have girlfriends who just follow them around watching them play thomas berdychs fiancee possibly wife particularly comes to mind as she is nadals girlfriend is humble enough to actually still do a normal job which i find quite amazing but she is very much in the minority many of the top female players dont have boyfriends because theyll only date guys of ultrahigh social status occasionally they will settle for a tennis coach if they cant find anyone else ie other sportsmen actors pop stars etc wozniacki dated rory mcilroy ivanovic is engaged to bastian schweinsteiger kournikova married enrique iglesias bouchard has been with numerous high profile men azarenka was dating some musician sharpaova has also dated numerous high profile men including the lead singer of maroon i could go on and of course no woman will let a man follow her around and watch her play tennis because she wont respect him but yet you still get ridiculous articles like which incredibly conclude that male tennis players girlfriends are prominent while female tennis players boyfriends are not prominent becausethe world is sexist against women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes pegging him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,question why would someone that cute with that kind of money choose to propose to a woman whos dated a lot of men and has a competitive career if this is exactly what men hate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i gotta say i really dont find serena williams even remotely attractive she looks like shes on hrt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,woman dates someone much less wealthy than her and this is proof of hypergamy obviously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,blech
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but shes pretty ugly though i dunno why he would want to marry her did you see the pic of her ass in those pants though damn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but shes pretty ugly though shes not bad looking and if you have a thing for fitthick women or black women as he quite obviously does shes a good fit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because hes a thirsty nerd at heart that stuff runs deep
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the guy is at the top of the tech industry hahahaha do you seriously think this or are you just saying it to make a point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree completely but money is the number one indicator of status if he was at the top of a particular field but poor i very much doubt she would be interested
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but like i also dont see him getting engaged to a woman with a psychology degree from a notverygood school and a job in hr you know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,did you mean to psot this on your other account
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she interacts with shit tonn of regular folks on waiters taxi drivers recaptionists barbers cashiers etc okay but those are not what one would call meaningful interactions i meet a ton of homeless people on a given day doesnt mean i actually spend time with them in any real capacity shes a woman wired like a woman shes not checking out every man she meets or scanning the room looking for a potential piece of cheap easy ass like some wealthier men might do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,social circles are actually quite homogenous her friends n acquaintances ppl she sees at partiesevents etc would be mostly within her class n thats the pool from which romantic partners are usually drawn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes very attractive so the pillosphere will probably try to use that angle that the wall didnt happen for her but yes the terps cant spin away the fact that this guy is at the pinnacle and could have the most stunning and youngest women in the world at his fingertips yet he went for love and id say respect for a womans accomplishments
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you forgot to mention he is way smarter than she is so what although this particular move may place some heavy doubt on that its not a smart move to marry a woman of means and status
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you forgot to mention he is way smarter than she is proof
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,although this particular move may place some heavy doubt on that nah fam if youre marrying a woman much more wealthy than you then youre the one who benefits within that marriage and in case of divorce this is one of few very limited cases where id say marriage is actually a smart move
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe hell drop by to claim that she likes him because of his personality i mean hes much poorer and less well known than her somaybe its not like she hasnt dated or had access to much wealthier men in the notsodistant past
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eeeh its quite easy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,from trps point off view wouldnt that be regarded as part of the qualities category how many men has serena dated that we know of idk how accurate this is httpwwwrankercomlistmenwhoserenawilliamshasdatedcelebrityhookups
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes being more arrogant about his intelligence did he invent one of the most used websites in the world i think not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha i dont remember posting a shirtless selfie must have been one of those nights you save it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know men dont have to get married right its not a legal obligationnot yet anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre just going to ignore radek stepanek then vaidisova hingis kvitova and god knows who else stan wawrinka left his wife and child to shack up with some hot croatian player im sorry to tell you that mate also agassi with brooke shields sampras borg edberg and wilander are also married to modelshave been married to models or actresses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know she could be lobbing it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mirin those striations
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id put good money on this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would someone that cute dgಠಠ
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he aint red pill b
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i suspect cuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my guess is hes worried that now hes rich women are only going to be after him for his money serena has more cash than him so he knows she isnt a golddigger he probably also has a fetish for athletic amazoniantype women they probably have a lot in common personality wise too also interracial couple is still a bit edgy which considering hes likely a massive nerd will a bit of a turn on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes going to be taking it in the boipucci
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think shes pretty attractive shes not conventional looking but she has a certain appeal i think there is a story that and it would be fair to say that hes had more women than me so he should be a reasonable judge having said that i watched the documentary venus and serena and she didnt come out of that looking like the best human being in the world imho and it was basically a promotional piece
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is far more likely than the reverse scenario if this hypothetical woman is hot i cant say this with confidence but im pretty confident that he would have been attracted to serena williams if she had mediocre socioeconomic status whereas i just dont think the reverse is true probably if there was a massive gulf in social class then its less likely that he would date her but i still think most men will be willing to date down in this way whereas a woman is extremely unlikely to do so imho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,amal and george clooney
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,elon musktalulah riley
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ooh has someone here got another account they post under
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even men dont do that lol wealthy or not how many men do you know who met their girlfriends because they were their cashier one day im sure it happens but its far from the norm people date within their social circle not from randoms they happen to meet on any given day ufairlynaive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes a woman wired like a woman shes not checking out every man she meets or scanning the room looking for a potential piece of cheap easy ass like some wealthier men might do so you agree with me women usually doesnt view people of lower status as potential romantic partners and men do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we discussed it groovy already majority of romantic partners are drawn from docial sircles but within the minority that doesnt men are more likely to date down
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes very attractive no no she isnt but this of course works in your favour it further proves trp wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where did i imply otherwise read my comment again if marriage is your goal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah some male tennis players dated famous women plenty did not also stepanek didnt fuck those women because they were famous he fucked them because they were available attractive and in every case better looking than him their fame and social status was utterly irrelevant he you can be sure that i am done dating tennis players do you think hes done dating hot young women i doubt it wawrinka shacked up with that croatian player because she is hot not because she plays tennis all of those other guys you mentioned are married to models and actresses because they are hot not because they have high social status so name me the female tennis player who shacked up with someone of significantly lower social status other than a coach name me the female tennis player who lets her boyfriend who hasnt got a job follow her around watching her matches
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hoooooly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thank god someone said it 😂
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh cmon hes super cute he reminds me of some actor and its bugging me so bad that i cant think of what i saw him in he almost looks like ted mosby but i swear its someone else im thinking of
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,russell brand is a sex addict who flirts with every woman he meets
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think when youve had as much pussy as russel brand has had you get bored about the whole thing and start to seek out increasingly extreme experiences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,serena williams has dated non famous guys before though she dated her coach as well as grigor dimitrov before he was very high in the rankings there are plenty of famous women who have dated or married massively down in status jessica alba married a camera man or something britney spears married a backup dancer jlo dated a backup dancer just from thinking off the top of my head you also neglect to mention that serena and her fiancé are of similar physical attractiveness usually men who date down in status date up in physical attractiveness so theres a trade off
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well yeah but i dont think that hr lady is going to be in his orbit at all at this point however hot she might be hugely successful people hang out with other hugely successful people and when you reach the strata that these two occupy there is no room for hr personnel with degrees from notverygood schools the gulf in social class is interesting to think about its entirely possible i dont know much about either of their backgrounds that both of them are from roughly the same ses although they are now both fabulously wealthy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it was most likely her status he might have been attracted but the chance of him marrying her would have been extremely low its not a nice stat but the number of white men marrying black women is very low compared to the number of white women marrying black men serena has a high status as well as good looks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you think shes the equivalent of a woman with a psych degree from a notverygoodschool and a job in hr
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes as accomplished in her field law as he is in his shes an internationally renown barrister
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,amal is very high status
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,talulah riley works for hr huh and here i thought she was an actress
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even men dont do that of fucking course they dont but wellyou try explaining that here i really didnt feel like rehashing the old but wot abt teh argument
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how many men do you know who met their girlfriends because they were their cashier one day quite a few actually not literally cashiers but other jobs in service industry that allow for a bit lengthier contact hell my godfather is for years married to a nurse that took care of him in the hospital
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,meh not exactly its more like women dont typically view men of dramatically lower status as potential life partners and men typically view such women only as a bit of fun to fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but this of course works in your favour i think shes attractive but it doesnt favour me to prove trp wrong i wish theyd go more in the right direction for the sake of the young uns
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,last i checked beauty is in the eye of the beholder i think shes gorgeous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh yeah my bad ignore me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so name me the female tennis player who shacked up with someone of significantly lower social status other than a coach name me the female tennis player who lets her boyfriend who hasnt got a job follow her around watching her matches maria kirilenko got knocked up by igor andreev who is pretty unremarkable looking most of the goodlooking female tennis players also date men who are hot and move in the same circles kournikova with iglesias being the prime example
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jeez dg not all boys are cute blech
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is more her type thats why she doesnt find the reddit founder cute
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,russell brand is a sex addict who flirts with every woman he meets watch flirting one thing hitting on someone a different thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you also neglect to mention that serena and her fiancé are of similar physical attractiveness well no ones going to agree with you here because black women are terribly undesirable or so im told that being said i dont think hes particularly cute nor she particularly ugly so yeah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well jose canseco httpsenwikipediaorgwikijessicacansecobiography for example i cant see the reverse happening i cant see caroline wozniacki going for someone who works in mcdonalds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the number of white men marrying black women is very low compared to the number of white women marrying black men and then for some reason they mostly get divorced
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no but she is far far far far far from the top of her fieldlaw an equivalent of george clooney in law would be a supreme court justice or one of the heads of the un
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes as accomplished in her field law as he is in his shes an internationally renown barrister internationally known doesnt mean anything no one heard of her ever before this she has some big clients thats all george clooney is a hollywood actor one of the most famous and successful there is an equivalent of george clooney in law would be a supreme court justice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can not compare the status of tier actress to elon fucking musk i bet there are hrs making what she does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i also wanna note that when i worked in retail on the tills i would constantly chat up the hot young girls i mean why wouldnt i and they responded positively like of the time despite my obvious low status one even kissed me haha obviously none of that ever went anywhere seriously but it massively boosted my confidence thereafter and fact is trp places way too much emphasis on status like sure you wont marry a woman who is a billionaire if youre on £ but outside of extremes it does not matter nearly as much as they believe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill see your anecdote and raise you one of my own my mum met my dad because he was her driver i still think thats a rare way to meet romantic partners tho like i said it certainly happens but the most common scenario is that you meet your so through your social circle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think shes a beast but still pretty like you know shes tight and fit and that booty on fleek for that guy shes a catch
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair enough i agree attractiveness is subjective
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,let me repeat the question name me the female tennis player who shacked up with someone of significantly lower social status other than a coach enrique iglesiasdoesnt count as someone of lower social status igor andreev former tennis professional doesnt count as someone of lower social status name me the female tennis player who lets her boyfriend who hasnt got a job follow her around watching her matches cant happen wont happen such an occurrence would be completely against female nature
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,omg i for a split second i thought you were admitting to being tw my poor heart
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really hes totally my type how can you not want to just grab onto and ride id go for him if only his fiancee couldnt crush my face with one hand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes like a plus a how is that not super cute
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,black women can be hot you sure are bby but serena williams aint gotta admit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well jose canseco is widely acknowledged as kind of a lummox excellent pro athlete but pretty dim he and the reddit guy whose name i dont even remember occupy different spheres now youve got me thinking about whether jose canseco and serena williams occupy the same sphere theyre both athletes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and that marriage lasted for how long more so how bigfamous was jose at the time he met the woman at hooters i ask that as theres a lot of athletes especially in football who arent well known at all but some at some point become well known
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jose canseco married someone he met in hooters for example i cant see the reverse happenin well nobecause women dont typically go for just a piece of arm candy well unless theyre wealthy year old widows who like boy toys
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and then for some reason they mostly get divorced thinking about the celebritysporting star marriages that come to mind yes youre right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she is british no and in private practice is she not topranked in her field
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one heard of her ever before this doesnt matter she lives in the same socioeconomic class as george which got her access to him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my point is that as an actress talullah riley is still about a jillion times more successful than most actresses are there actresses more successful still of course but you could easily make the argument that when it comes to elon fucking musk there are maybe people on the planet as allaround successful as he male or female so he is by definition going to be marrying down regardless of who he marries
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most common scenario is that you meet your so through your social circle i dont challenge that my point is that among couples that have disparity in status he is the one with the higher status most likely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep she is in shape and probably knows what to do to get him hard shes been handling a racket and playing with balls for years think about that grip a fit sportstar is not against any rp tenets there are a lot of men who wished their women would hit the gym
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well you cited andy murray even so his socalled childhood sweetheart is the daughter of a famous tennis coach so im guessing that youre going to stretch most definitions of fame and status or lack of it to satisfy your preconceived notions you also mention roger federers wife mirka even so she was a professional player who represented switzerland in the olympics agnieszka radwanskas boyfriend is a polish tennis pro who reached a career high ranking of in we actually have no idea who most tennis players are dating and only see the highprofile dalliances through online communities i doubt that wed even be aware if for example karolina pliskova or timea bacsinszky were dating some random guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plot twist everyone on ppd except you is my alt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,soft beta eyes yucky
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know if youve seen the simpsons softball episode in which canseco features but i heard an interview with the show runners and they said all of the players were wonderful and really charming apart from one and im sure it was canseco who they said was a dick yeah it was i just found the link where they talk about this so i will give you that but here is you cant tell me that middleclass guys would look at her and think well im certainly not getting involved with her shes the wrong social class im sorry im not having that in terms of the background of canseco and williams i would suggest that canseco was in reality significantly poorer there has always been this image that the williams sisters grew up in the ghetto etc etc this is rather misleading
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jose conseco is my absolute favorite account i follow on twitter hes such a goofyass weirdo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not an expert on baseball but he was playing for the texas rangers and had already been in the allstar game several times so im guessing he was quite well known in terms of the length of the marriage the guy is a dick and he hit her not surprising that she dumped him equally not surprising that she was attracted to the very famous and wealthy baseball player jose canseco in the first place also not surprising that he was attracted to her nothing about the situation is surprising to me at least
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but you could easily make the argument that when it comes to elon fucking musk there are maybe people on the planet as allaround successful as he male or female so he is by definition going to be marrying down regardless of who he marries yes and thats a part of the reason why my point stands the top of the top people in this world are mostly menthe very bottom as well but thats beside the point and we can not realistly not observe that men are more likely to date down
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh boy not this again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because im charming and sexy it doesnt fucking matter how much money i have i could be one of those poor sods working in the amazon warehouses getting paid shit and still be attractive you dont need money to get pussy unless youre visiting a prostitute now marriage thats another matter
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you also mention roger federers wife mirka even so she was a professional player who represented switzerland in the olympics yeah and she completely stopped playing tennis to focus on following roger around and supporting him andy murrays girlfriend gets to toss around doing a bit of painting and she says she might write a novel but as far as im aware she hasnt bothered to do so here are her life sounds pretty leisurely wouldnt you agree show me the female tennis player who allows a man with no job to follow her around and watch her and offer her support cant happen wont happen doesnt happen these are not preconceived notions these are simple observations about life that i had to learn from experience women want status women expect men to work hard to maintain that status women will not let some guy quit working to provide supplicating support to them men will men will date someone of much lower social status if she is hot women are extremely unlikely to do so this is all far more applicable to high status women like professional tennis players
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like them tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,😏
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is one of my favorite simpsons episodes possibly my favorite simpsons episode middle class dudes would jump on jessica canseco umc dudes would not she looks too porny and would compromise their status seriously one of mr arthurs boarding school compadres was dating a woman who looked a lot like that i met her at an event when we got the alumni bulletin that announced his marriage we learned that he had married a totally different woman with a totally different and less overtly sexual appearance edit just confirmed with mr arthur he says that his boarding school peeps would fuck jessica canseco through the mattress but would never ever marry her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but here is jessica canseco is that a tranny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but here is jessica canseco uh dude that isnt a recent picture of her and that is photoshopped to hell heres a more recent of her shes not bad looking but not exactly smoking hot either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah and she completely stopped playing tennis to focus on following roger around and supporting him they apparently met at sydney federer was always an untamed talent at the time but it took him years before his talent materialised into actual success i think that theyre a lovely authentic couple and i wonder whether the rare occurrence of them producing a double set of twins is not somehow related to the extraordinary genetics which made rog a candidate for goat andy murrays girlfriend gets to toss around doing a bit of painting and she says she might write a novel but as far as im aware she hasnt bothered to do so here are facts about kim sears her life sounds pretty leisurely wouldnt you agree i cant help but think that if id offered an example of nick bollettieris handsome grandson dating a top female player then youd twist that into a status scenario andys wife is from the same social stratosphere as he is just as novaks childhood sweetheart wasnt exactly sweeping the streets of belgrade when he met her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dolly parton married some anonymous guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ages ago there was a thread on here where we posted images of members of the opposite sex we think are hot and someone commented that someone i posted had masculine features this had never occurred to me previously but ive since noted that i do have a tendency to be attracted to women with certain masculine facial features i have no idea why this is but i still maintain that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,firstly he didnt marry her recently he met her years ago secondly she was in playboy on the front cover while her relative fame contributed to this you cant tell me that unattractive women get on the front cover of playboy thirdly in august of this year now aged yearsold there are not many better looking yearolds out there than that i dont know if youre male or female but if you believe otherwise then i suggest you walk around with your eyes open more often
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah they played in the hopman cup together in theyre a great couple i agree i actually sat pretty near mirka at wimbledon in and you can see that she sincerely loves him i think its great that he hasnt gone for the stereotypical trophy wife butno woman will let a man follow her around without a job let alone a really high status women doesnt happen cant happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agnieszka radwańska is married to her hitting partner dominica cibulkova is married to an engineer so thats a rare example of a partner with a normal job lets look at the mens top andy murrays wife does nothing novak djokovics wife has never had a job milos raonic is dating some hot model who always seems to be at his matches stan wawrinka is dating tennis player donna vekic marin cilic is dating a student dominic thiem is dating romana exenberger a candidate in miss austria kei nishikori is dating a yoga instructor who is often seen at his matches gael monfils is dating a student rafael nadal is dating a childhood sweetheart who he met in mallorca tomas berdych has a model girlfriend called ester satorova who follows him around all over the place and the womens top angelique kerber is dating her coach serena williams is engaged to the founder of reddit agnieszka radwańska is married to her hitting partner i cant find any information on the boyfriend of simona halep dominika cibulkova is married to an engineer karolina pliskova is dating michal hrdlicka who is a television sports presenter garbine muguruza doesnt have a boyfriend madison keys doesnt have a boyfriend svetlana kuznetsova doesnt seem to have a boyfriend there is speculation that shes gay jo kontas boyfriend works for the company that operates hawkeye and is a former tennis coach i didnt know that but as i predicted all of the women either go out with someone high status or have been forced to settle for someone involved in tennis with the honourable exception of cibulkova or still think theyre going to get someone of high status and so havent committed to anyone yet whereas all of the guys have picked hot women and dont give a shit what they do for a living entirely predictable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are not many better looking yearolds out there than that i dont know if youre male or female but if you believe otherwise then i suggest you walk around with your eyes open more often one there is and i do very much walk with my eyes open as how else am i going to check them out i should notesay that where i live isnt the norm as theres a ton of hot women here of all ages it what happens when yoga and plastic surgery are quite popular among women and the gold digger culture is alive and well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah they played in the hopman cup together in theyre a great couple i agree i actually sat pretty near mirka at wimbledon in and you can see that she sincerely loves him i think its great that he hasnt gone for the stereotypical trophy wife i find it unpleasant when some contributors in online communities ridicule mirka for being fat and ugly and the usual comments of why federer didnt do better etc roger federer is a decent looking guy and one of the most famous and iconic sportsmen in the world he obviously has many options yet he chose to marry and raise a family with a woman who he clearly has a deep emotional and romantic connection with butno woman will let a man follow her around without a job let alone a really high status women doesnt happen cant happen yeah i kind of agree with you here for example i think that agnieszka radwanska is cute sexy and appears to have a genuinely not pr fun and engaging personality id wife her up in a heartbeat even if she were a cashier at my local aldis
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like wozniacki a very genuine person and i think shes gorgeous unfortunately she wouldnt touch me with a barge pole shes had the world number golfer i couldnt possibly compare i used to like lisicki for similar reasons but she seems to have forgotten how to play tennis and when i was younger i used to like hingis im not quite so keen on her now that shes lost weight when she was a teenager i thought she was sexy as fuck still none of them would go out with me completely pointless to even fantasise about it really
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like wozniacki a very genuine person and i think shes gorgeous unfortunately she wouldnt touch me with a barge pole shes had the world number golfer i couldnt possibly compare outside of status though rory mcilroy is hardly a chad im not gay but if i were i wouldnt mind henrik stenson using his wedge to chip one out of the old bunker hole if you know what i mean no homo and when i was younger i used to like hingis i liked her too i still think that shes seriously pretty at its good that shes found her niche and most importantly enjoying her tennis in her doubles play dem angles doe i have to admit that i had a bit of a crush on jelena dokic circa i also enjoyed monica puigs extraordinary run during the summer and not just because she won her countrys first olympic gold if you know what i mean
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i always think mcilroy looks a bit like a rat i think hes a decent guy actually i find what he did with wozniacki though to be utterly bizarre but i suppose its better than going through with the wedding if youre not sure once youre the golf world number though you can bat onemillion miles out of your league hingis is still really attractive but shes just a bit on the skinny side for me now she is megatalented i agree she just doesnt have the serve or the power to play singles in the modern game
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,removed for trolling
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id rather die alone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i will choose guy number one maybe the assault rifle will end my life before the process begins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill kill myself before i sleep with either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,guy for the free def leppard tix im calling bs on buying roses in valentines day though ive been a sub they cant afford that shit gotta say though i almost went with out of sheer curiosity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even for a shit post youre really scraping the bottom of the toilet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,obviously the one who wont crush me and kill me when he tries to get on top is it even possible to have sex with him the belly seems like too much of a barrier
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,throwing up in my mouth the less fat one i guess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why tf is that first pic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im sorry im stuck on the logistics the obese black man doesnt seem that big so why does his stomach sag like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh man are you not entertained so mean
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no kidding i think i know what im gonna do going forward here why not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im the cream of the crap and only associate with those who float up to my level just dont flush the toilet or were all going down
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that ape has clearly lost a lot of weight why you gotta hate guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you not entertained have you seen my flair so mean sry bb
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,xd oh man so cute lol i enjoy seeing red pillers and other dominant men get broken
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its ok i still love you babe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah no my ego plz help me baby halp oh yeah already did that guess who helps oh yeah its me hell yes go me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why am i horny now xd i guess i have a dominatrix fetish
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how come the red pill constantly says theyre a selfimprovement sub but gets upvoted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the blue pill is kinda of a hateful sub they make fun of men they are aggressive to anyone who comes into their sub and doesnt agree with them they mock men who have trouble getting women either claiming that they are hideous or are shooting for women outside of their league good thing i have thick skin skin so thick i was perma banned from blue pill sub without ever having commented there haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being satiric doesnt mean that they dont mean what they are saying it means you shouldnt engage because there is no discussion unlike here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,anyone else find it hilarious how every post on that sub very obviously is written by someone walking on eggshells it doesnt look like a very good environment for open discussion and anyone who says anything wrong gets downvoted into oblivion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so those are a couple of examples of the shitty things that go along with being a man in order to fix that we need more communities like rmenslib where the ideals of feminism or egalitarianism if that word triggers you are embraced and all of our sexrelated problems can be discussed in a way that doesnt minimize anyone elses problems this really made me laugh yes i am certain that if we just started discussing important things like how there is no lingerie for men how incredibly opressed male vegans are and why there is such a shortage of sex toys for men all while ignoring totally irrelevant things like why feminist icon emma watson just happens to despite screaming about disolving gender roles just has to get together with billionaire after billionaire or how the leading feminism for men organization in my country still thinks that the issue affecting men is mens violence against women or how i am as a man is just supposed to suck it up when women post pictures of male models with enormous bulges and sixpack abs becasue they dont explicitly tell me that i am worthless for looking like that all the while i am supposed to feel sorry for young women who feel inadequate by pictures of female models despite not a single person saying that women who dont look like female models are worthless and lets continue with how i am supposed to just accept that women reject me because i am older and sexually inexperienced because right to sexual preference but when men reject women with too many previous partners it is slut shaming and lets continue with the concept of opression olympics odd how every experience from men can be erased by explaining why women have it worse yet when talking about how people in syria and iraq have far greater problems then it is full stop yes lets continue with that i am certain that will work
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i sexually identify as uomlili on rthebluepill it is not a satire subreddit its an antithesis to rtheredpill what i have learned from my first year of lurking and using the internet is that there are a ton of crazies and lunatics and rthebluepill is no exception remember its those stupid fucking terps or subhuman scum terps who are the bad guys also rthebluepill is loving and accepting to all kinds of people as long as your not a dumb terp fucking incel or a stupid shithead donald trump supporter then please get out of their loving tolerant space
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how come that theyre dancing around the one major issue which causes men to flock to these places the incessant biological urge to have sex but no willing partner to have sex with its ridiculous to cite social issues such as expectations of masculinity while ignoring the fact that men are driven by this constant hormonal urge to have sex and turn to radical movements because their sexual and romantic needs arent met
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they are busy having a catfight with deadbedrooms usually happens every months or so trp comment in sub gets brigaded by tbp deadbedrooms shits on them and tbp shames them into acquiescing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i notice how the women basically say that trp has no legitimate claims and basically has to be crushed without allowing for opposition to the gynocratic society we have created ergo there will be no debate or ability to compromise with feminists on this issue and the debate will continue forever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am personally afraid of redpill men ive dated them before and they treat you like shit i have way too much trauma from dealing with actual abuse and have known other women that have been beaten and even stabbed eastern european women mostly and all of the men involved were always these victim complex men with a need for vengeance against women its taught me to never trust men who blame their inadequacies on women i remember the guys i dated would complain about their baby mamas while cheating on both of us i remember being called names because some of them think negging actually works these men have no selfawareness or idea how much they can destroy people they choose instead to nurse their wounds because some girl rejected them in grade redpill men love to complain about how awful women are and how its our fault men dont commit this is mgtow mostly but yet none of these men are ever romantic or put any effort into courting or relationships theyre stupid enough to think lifting weights and calling girls names gets their panties dropping i am so lucky to not be dating right now i feel so bad for millennial women so so so bad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this again how many times has this question been asked on this sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because trp is also a male space where other mens issues are discussed duh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiandyouarelynchingnegroes really old tactic didnt work then doesnt work now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because its a sexual strategy sub with a self improvement aspect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that has absolutely nothing to do with tbp which is the topic of this post you have no argument so youre simply trying to deflect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only way to be with a single mom is by killing both her previous partner and their offspring like lions do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah they are delusional and know trp is right but would never admit that outright or some are so naive and delusional that they really think trp is bullshit and doesnt produce desired results
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that sub is full of confused sjws they dont even care about the red pill they just make fun of incels and guys on asktrp mainly im pretty sure they low key all agree with the red pill i tend to think the same way from what ive read on the bp they dont believe incels exist but at the same time they make fun of every guy who cant get laid it hurts mah feelings but what am i supposed to do they insult guys even more when they are emotionally expressive regarding their bad luck with women either by saying men arent entitled to women which is true or saying dudes are going for women tt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good thing i have thick skin skin so thick i was perma banned from blue pill sub without ever having commented there haha worlds smallest violin begins playing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they really are trp has its share of crazies but also people genuinely looking for answers and selfimprovement tbp makes me think of a bunch of smug nerds sitting back and snarkily mocking trpers i find them the more distasteful of the two
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is my impression of the sub as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the anger phase is strong with you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why arent red pillers allowed in the sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you really omlili
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well the thing is that the men who are blue pillers and claim that casual sex is so easy to get fail to notice that the only reason casual sex is easy for them is due to their chad looks then we have the women there lol now those shame men for wanting casual sex and also shame men for not pursuing women on that one im divided i dont know if they shame men who dont pursue women because they want the ego boost of being approached by men only to reject them if they dont look like legends of the fall brad pitt or they are thinking they are losing out on beta buxs when dudes just give up the blue pillers do not want to admit to this heartbreaking reality therefore they go ahead and shittalk red pillers every shot they got
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats one issue trpers love to bring up but never provide any solutions besides adapting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are driven by this constant hormonal urge to have sex and turn to radical movements because their sexual and romantic needs arent met a better question for them would be why are people driven to radicalization period
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the thing about the real world and real life is that people dont share your morals with you and really dont give a shit there can be no covenants between men and lions wolves and lambs can never be of one mind lions are gonna eat you no matter what you can go in the cage with harambre and be nice im sure he wont rip you to shreds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but who the fuck cares let us fuck blue pillers need not worry about our sex life as much as they do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you mean the ones that adopted the moral compasses of feminists me me me me me me burn everything else down
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if tbp was about making fun of trp id post there but its not its a sjw circlejerk
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uamericanhistoryafbb in defence of tbp this is one of the top upvoted comments on that link im on rthebluepill just to laugh at reddits top minds of sexual strategy stopping guys from being radicalised by trp is a good and altruistic goal but its way beyond my pay grade
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,look at their actions not their words tbp is just like a bitch cause it mostly is full of bitches and men with feminine values
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,negging does work and lifting weights and calling girls stupid names does drop panties maybe youre different but this shit is chess not checkers it works on most
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think trp are the only people who lack selfawareness reading between the lines of your post why would you date people with baby mamas and why would you have sex with them before you properly vetted them you did say cheating on both of us which means the relationship got intimate before you learned the truth and it sounds like this happened multiple times it doesnt make me ask whats wrong with them but whats wrong with you this is just like the female version of the nice guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,too many to count
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,welp the tbp is a gender neutral space where gender issues are discussedduh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah if he ever bothered to answer the question i asked then op would have the answer to his own
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see how whining about miranda kerr and calling single moms subhuman scum is a sexual strategy butok
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is it deflection answer the question i originally posed and youll have the answer to this op
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah its the tu quoque fallacy and its one of the more irritating logical fallacies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but why do we even need an argument why cant a sub that makes fun of trp also have serious posts about trp i dont see the hypocrisy here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this needs to be upvoted more everytime someone points out an inconsistency or some hypocrisy their go to argument is but they can do it why cant we in which case you have no right to complain about the other side especially if you want to hold the moral high ground
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if its good enough for nature then its good enough for me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,spending that much time on a satire sub doesnt make sense its straight up denial and delusion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,arent you a woman do you really think trp theory is in its core correct
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,correct all of the people on the blue pill know the red pill is real and how they attempt to discredit the truth red pill wants to teach young men to help young men succeed with girls and to not end up as beta bux like most dudes who arent chad end up because it disrupts their agenda to have fun with chads while they are young and marry beta bux later in life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why so small is it being played by a midget or a fairy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres crazy people everywhere it makes no sense to dub a sub as hateful and toxic to the lives of young men and women just because some creeps are so autistic that they cant figure out that sexual strategy is moral not amoral and that their obsession with party girls is dumb d theres plenty of decentlooking girls out there who arent taking chad dick every hour of the day they should look for those instead of looking at kim kardashian
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah they mock men who hate women for not sleeping with them and shame women for being women do red pillers really hate women for not sleeping with them everytime a girl rejects me i congratulate her for having good taste and telling me no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,anger phase
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they actually are just dont go around proselytizing it and have yourself a good ol merry shit post time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dunno im perma banned from blue pill and i never posted there lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah people are driven to radical movements when their basic needs arent fulfilled while there are some decent comments in that linked thread just about every contributor appears to have a casual and flippant disregard for the importance of sex on peoples psyches and how a lack of sex for any serious length of time will lead to a negative downward spiral of mental health
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,kinda like asking a bull not to gore you because youre a vegan
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love that even you are now agreeing with the concept of subjective morality haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who the fuck cares about who the fuck is caring about who you fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rtheredpillcirclejerk
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if tbp was about making fun of trp idk last i checked it was about an even split maaayyyybe in favor of circlejerking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jerks off furiously to nonsatirical threads in tbp that catch trps attention whilst in ppd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont really care about tbp i was just responding to your comment honestly idk why op wastes his time over there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,welp the tbp is a gender neutral space where gender issues are discussedduh and here i thought it was satire thanks for clearing that up now i know that it is not a satire sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre no better than trump but what about her emails
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,avoiding single mothers is a pretty damn good sexual strategy for men the hyperbole is for the autists who dont understand nuance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,avoiding getting into relationships with single mothers is a good strategy for men who dont want to be used
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,god when mr arthur starts slandering miranda kerr shiver i just cant control myself hes had to stop doing it so often because it was just getting ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,deleted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the answer to that question is that trp is a place filled with genuine misogyny so i guess your answer is that tbp is a place filled with genuine man hate then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see the hypocrisy here tbp specifically bills itself as a satire sub then uses the its just a prank bro defense when anybody addresses their serious posts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in which case you have no right to complain about the other side especially if you want to hold the moral high ground theres that and theres the fact that claiming trp does x has no bearing whatsoever on whether tbp does x or not if i ask do republicans take money from big businesses shouting well democrats take money from big doesnt address the question its just a deflection
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,satire is a powerful form of commentary
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not a satire sub at all its a propaganda sub created by chads party girls and women who are interested in getting a beta bux some day after theyre done enjoying the endless parade of chad cock everytime you point out something from the red pill on their sub that has an equivalent in real life they lose their shit and insult you to kingdom come or perma ban you lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes you sound very angry and judgmental maybe you should step away from the internet and go outside for awhile
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im banned from there just for being associated with trp tbp is a shitty sub that doesnt allow anything except circlejerking about how bad trp is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do you use two accounts for posting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah people are driven to radical movements when their basic needs arent fulfilled thats bullshit though are american or europeanborn jihadists driven towards isis or alqaeda because their basic needs arent fulfilled are radical feminists driven because of that what about wbc members and supporters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about womens sexuality or that so many refuse to admit we havw a strong sexual libido to begin with what about womens needs that have not been met in the past many centuries
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just about every contributor appears to have a casual and flippant disregard for the importance of sex on peoples psyches i think theres that and theres also the denial of how difficult it is for many if not most men to get what theyd consider a reasonable amount and variety of sex its not much different than dismissing the fact that just about everyone wants to live without constant financial stress and then denying that a lot of people struggle to do so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,huh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theyre not leaving the humans alone to be nice or because of ethics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but trp isnt roosh trp is trp and we are all individuals who dont all share the same opinions we are diverse like your beloved feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what do you care
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like what a shitty satire article slept with willing women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its funny how blue pillers have magical standards where they believe every hyperbolic detail he writes about an encounter when it serves their purposes to yell rape and yet deny that he did any of the things he talks about in his books and cell him a fraud who lives in his mothers basement mental gymnastics and intellectual dishonesty on that level should get a gold medal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but he did get laid right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,roosh v is not trp roissy and rollo have nothing to do with trp at all and roosh v is a creep
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who the fuck cares about who the fuck cares about who the fuck is caring about who we fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who the fuck cares about who the fuck is caring about who the fuck is caring about who they fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly idk why op wastes his time over there i dont either this is a stupid failed gotcha post and its already been done who gives a fuck what tbp does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for research and for the outrage porn i suppose i need to find a way to ban thebluepill from my browser and focus on theredpill but i am always curious to see what they have been saying about us so i go there and lurk for some stupid reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who the hell can read tbp for any length of time and think this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a satire sub where occasionally people make serious posts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre no better than trump compliments will get you nowhere with me sir
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,avoiding single mothers is a pretty damn good sexual strategy for men is it though i heard single moms are the easiest lays
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you see that boys men reading and having opinions on celebrity gossip is the ultimate panty dropper
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what did miranda kerr do to deserve the slander o
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nobody has to date or think single moms are these perfect angels but thats vastly different from calling them subhuman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you think so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its just a prank bro defense when anybody addresses their serious posts when did that happen is anyone even denying that some posts are more serious especially considering that they even have a serious tag the thing is that tbp just arent superspergs they dont need to have strict definitions for everything a trp satire sub can also have serious posts about trp dont see the issue here unless you are a supersperg thats like but every post has to be satire on a satire board do you also get mad when a steak house sells salads as well do you write online reviews calling them out on it like you fucking hypocrites its a steak house and not a salad house it is illegal to sell anything else than pure steak in a steak house or when a clothing store also sells little gadgets do you shout at the owner but you guys said you are a clothing store and now you also sell perfume perfume is not the same as clothes fucking hypocrites i seriously dont see the problem here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp isnt a self improvement sub at all its a cope created by angry spergs who cant get laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres only rainbows and lollypops here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol that comment was obviously satirical come on and i dont even like omlili
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pretty sure ufiatlux posts there and hasnt been banned yet but maybe he doesnt post on trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im banned from there just for being associated with trp that doesnt sound right trps and rpws posthave posted there without issue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats what it was made for only difference is that you call it circlejerking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats what it was made for only difference is that you call it circlejerking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same here i was banned from the bue pill sub despite never having said anything on that sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant use my other account it impersonates another user uomlala
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are american or europeanborn jihadists driven towards isis or alqaeda because their basic needs arent fulfilled most of the europeanborn jihadists appear to be people who lack identity and culture strong needs which arent met who are native to the country but are second or third generation immigrants from lax muslim families others are islamic converts which is practically synonymous with some kind of prior mental illness andor existential crisis in western cultures which is also caused by the lack of the basic need of social acceptance and respect male sexual frustration also plays a huge part in this as you feel angry and less of a man when you cant fulfil your hormonal lust with anything other than wanking one off and that has virtually nothing to do with social pressures although they do have a minor contributory effect and everything to do with the male endocrine system
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about them women outside of estrus are practically asexual until they get reactively turned on whereas men get these constant intense and sometimes overwhelming hormonal reminders throughout the day i have sympathy for women who cant have their sexual or romantic desires fulfilled but lets not pretend that its remotely the same for women as it is to men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think one of the major things which people fail to acknowledge is if you rate poverty on a scale of with meaning no food no clothes and no house then virtually no one in the world would score just about everyone in the western world would score if you rate hunger on a scale of then nobody outside of someone in a famine is experiencing if you rate a house which protects you from the elements then once again hardly any one of billion would score a in terms of sex however theres a sizeable minority of people across all countries cultures and religions who score a on the sexual fulfilment scale
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you the one who have always taken the opposing position that morality is not subjective and that claiming otherwise makes you an edgelord the fact that in the past month or so youve made multiple comments in favour of subjective morality is amusing that is all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but of course you give no such quarter to feminism or feminists when you are your ilk assert that theyre all menhating scum
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nothing to do with trp theyre literally in the sidebar how much more can you even have to do with trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how much wood would the woodchuck chuck if the woodchuck would chuck wood
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fucked if i know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont you lean tbp or do you lean trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who gives a fuck what tbp does i guess the same could be asked why people give a fuck what trp does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,leechblock for chrome lets you block custom urls eg wwwredditcomrthebluepill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,read the first six words on the tbp sidebar rthebluepill is a satire of rtheredpill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,easy lays amazing for pump and dumps but a lot of after work involved and every single mother under i know is mildly retarded or bpd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trying to lock guys down probably
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no its not if women are allowed to talk strategy on avoiding rp men then men are allowed to talk strategy in avoiding single moms
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and more importantly who the fuck is miranda kerr
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,deleted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you were caught red handed trying to deflect the discussion and youre weaseling your way out of it instead of owning up to it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,steak house selling salad is a horrible analogy steak and salad go very well together
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when did that happen heres the form of the discussion a red piller on here says heres what appears to be a serious post from tbp and heres my argument against what it has to say blue pillers reply oh that its just satire rather than address the substance of your argument were just going to say its wrong because they were totally just joking only people with wouldnt get that its a joke the red piller replies its clearly serious and there are other serious posts on tbp why wouldnt i take it seriously blue pillers reply you cant even read it says were a satire sub right on the front page the problem isnt that tbp deals in two styles of content the problem is that they lie to your face about what type of content a particular post is if a bunch of circlejerking comes up with a halfway decent point its served up as a critique of trp that should be taken seriously but when trp breaks down blue pill posts that are obviously intended to be serious suddenly everythings a prank bro
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp isnt a self improvement sub at all its a cope created by angry spergs who cant get laid and you say this why when theres plenty of red pillers who joined the red pill and now can get laid what do you want as proof for them to record the sexxxxx lol who cant get laid arent you a woman a woman shitting on guys who cant get laid are like kings making fun of peasants lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wtf all this time i thought omlala was a parody of you ಠಠ
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im fucking confused
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,havent seen him post for like half a year now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hmm most of the europeanborn jihadists appear to be people who lack identity and culture strong needs which arent met i mean i guess it all depends on your personal interpretation of lacking identity and culture but from what i know that certainly doesnt appear to be the case for many of them dzhokar tsarnaev boston bomber was a very popular highly attractive and well adjusted dartmouth student who identified a lot with hiphop culture and had lots of friends who described him as funny chill and an avid pot smoker saajid badat london shoe bomber was a wellliked student aspiring physician and the son of a prominent and popular businessman mohamed lahouaiejbouhlel nice attacker was a year old french national avid latin dancer and frequent clubgoer he had a lot of friends a wife a life and pieces of ass on the side its been a while since i read up on him but last i checked he was a total pussyhound who liked to go clubbing and pick up randoms to fuck shehzad tanweer bomber was an extremely talented athlete popular in school and known for being a skilled runner soccer player and martial artist omar mateen orlando shooter was an american born native new yorker and closet case who hung out in gay clubs and had no shortage of twink dick at his disposal mohammed emwazi aka the infamous jihadi john was yet another ostensibly welladjusted young man who grew up in a pretty lax household and didnt have a lot of difficulty making friends male sexual frustration also plays a huge part in this as you feel angry and less of a man when you cant fulfil your hormonal lust with anything other than wanking one off well i might have been able to agree with you here had i not already known many of those responsible for horrible terror attacks werent exactly hard up for sex aside from the ones i mentioned above id like to add rizwan farook james holmes and tamerlan tsarnaev to the list in terms of terrorists who were not only not incels but quite obviously had access to regular sex and with fairly attractive women at that all in all im kind of struggling to see exactly which strong needs of theirs werent being met
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you rate poverty on a scale of with meaning no food no clothes and no house then virtually no one in the world would score just about everyone in the western world would score interestingly enough the western worlds score would be comically higher than that a single person earning just annually in the us less than fulltime minimum wage in terms of sex however theres a sizeable minority of people across all countries cultures and religions who score a on the sexual fulfilment scale longterm i wouldnt say its a sizeable minority i dont think there are that many men who make it late into adulthood as virgins but shorter term yeah there are plenty of men who go through lengthy dry spells and still more commonly there are plenty of men who get some sexual fulfillment on occasion but are far from happy with their situation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people poach them for their fur and for sport
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,roosh v is not a good model for our young men i dont doubt that but who is a good role model for our young men i hope youll say lord byron and casanova
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah drugging and raping women is ok because trp totally teaches that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wtf trp doesnt teach men to drug and rape women s dont associate roosh v with the trp roosh v wants to hurt women trp wants to teach young men how to love women by giving them the fuck of their lives be the best alpha shell ever have
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,does that get you laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh that trp only lends ears to roosh v and roissy and rollo because those guys have huge communities its marketing honestly rollo is an old ugly man and roosh v is one ugly motherfucker that looks like he hasnt showered in weeks no one takes them seriously d
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pounds

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thanks ill have to put it to use
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,read all words of what i just said if you look at tbp and read whats written yet still think its only satire thats on you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,doesnt matter had sex ¯ツ¯
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bpd crazy in the head crazy in the bed trust me fam haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree and i think all red pillers should avoid single mothers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,miranda kerr is one of the worlds foremost catwalk models australian shes in her shes a face brand of victorias secret she was married to orlando bloom and had a baby son with him later they divorced and she married a man who is younger than her and already a billionaire lol smart girl i like her she was the one who caused the divorce between herself and bloom because mr bloom claims he still has feelings for her this is her new husband this is why i dont believe in the nonsense that red pillers can become chads by lifting and them pump and dump year old girls when even the chads with a shit ton of social status and money get dumped by hot women and get obsessed over them lolol this guy is a billionair young and not badlooking still he goes for a woman in her there is no such thing as a wall for beautiful women hahaha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hyperbole for the sake of illustration oh okay then tbp should adopt this motto as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youd think wrong then i dont need to weasel my way out of anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so does mocking a childs extended tantrum and wondering about their future
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not a satire sub at all its a propaganda sub created by chads party girls and women who are interested in getting a beta bux some day after theyre done enjoying the endless parade of chad cock and you say this why when theres plenty of blue pillers who are in normal average relationships and have normal sex lives what do you want as proof for them to record the healthy communication with their workaday sos lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,omception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,illuminati confirmed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a pretty simplistic idea of culture and identity visible minorities who are the children of recent immigrants often suffer a huge identity crisis and lack of cultural belonging they usually suffer prejudice from an early age and in a lot of cases this creates anger and resentment towards their host country and society on the other hand they objectively share of culture with their birth country and very little culture with their parents or grandparents country of origin so they end up hating their own country and having no connection or fellowfeeling towards their country of origin this leaves them in a cultural limbo and ripe to be radicalised when a cause which socially accepts and validates them comes along this scenario has played out time and time again in different countries and different cultures id also like a citation on those examples of spree killers having fulfilling sex lives just because someone is goodlooking andor popular doesnt mean that they necessarily have access to regular sex with desirable women thats the just world fallacy talking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,longterm i wouldnt say its a sizeable minority i dont think there are that many men who make it late into adulthood as virgins im not talking exclusively about virgins im talking about people who go for a considerable length of time without having sex or sexual affection
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you the one who have always taken the opposing position that morality is not subjective and that claiming otherwise makes you an edgelord the fact that in the past month or so youve made multiple comments in favour of subjective morality is amusing that is all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,me thats fucking who do drugs and fuck bitches more serious answer felix dennis a selfmade multimillionaire who did drugs and fucked bitches
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah man bet i could rack up some mad karma telling them fucks how to buy rohypnol off the darknet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in all but words ive seen more than enough posts whining about antirape tools and legislation and asserting that women are at the mental level of children to bring me to the conclusion that theres at best a lax attitude to rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah yeah we all heard that its just business doesnt make them stand any higher
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp puts some writings from roosh roissy and rollo because those writings are foundational to the concepts discussed at trp its not about their personalities its about their expository skill at explaining and setting out and discussing the concepts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and ounces
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats fucking silly powerpuff girls forevah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what brought that up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,purple as dat lean sippin on dat codeine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree with you that people are taking tbp a little too literally and seriously but its quite ironic that it clinches the description by saying that hateful people from hateful subs are not welcome here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,read the title of this post how come the blue pill constantly says theyre a satire sub but yet stuff like this gets upvoted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sometimes it is in fact not worth it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,says a person who comes from the gender that regrets sex much more
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you forgot to add the part where were doing women a favor by avoiding single mothers and avoiding any other subtype of women s
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thanks for the concise answer haha shes cute in that first pic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she slept with beiber as well lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,deleted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a perfect illustration of a tbp mindset
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but why even bother with their future thats theirs to worry about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and you say this why because blue pillers come here and say they are averagelooking men and that their n count is almost and that they are making out with men and girls approach them for threesomes and that shit doesnt happen irl to average nonfat nonugly men at all there are dudes all over the world who are getting rejected all the time and they arent even ugly nor fat and blue pillers say the world is a fuckfest for anyone oo n normal average relationships and have normal sex lives seriously only if they have chad looks to begin with for them to record the healthy communication with their workaday sos whats a workday so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do the mods allow this kind of childish echoing supposedly they started cracking down on this nonsense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,visible minorities who are the children of recent immigrants often suffer a huge identity crisis and lack of cultural belonging but somehow so many millions of other visible minorities dont blow themselves up or massacre innocent men women and children hundreds of thousands of people go without having even their most basic needs met you know real life shit like food clothing and shelter yet still they find it in their hearts to not shoot up theatres or strap themselves with suicide vests go figure ¯ツ¯ they usually suffer prejudice from an early age and in a lot of cases this creates anger and resentment towards their host country and society yeah so do millions of black hispanic and asian men but somehow we still dont see many john daos blowing up nail salons i find it interesting that you seem to think that brown muslim men being wholeheartedly accepted into white protestant or catholic culture is a similarly basic need to actual essentialslike housing but frankly thats a discussion for another day so ill drop it id also like a citation on those examples of spree killers having fulfilling sex lives most of this stuff i already knew because hey what can i say i like reading about terrorists but im pretty sure all of this is fairly easily researchable and verifiable thats a pretty simplistic idea of culture and identity im sorry but are you really trying to tell me that making friends generally fitting in and having the ability to get sex is a simplistic idea of culture and identity like im sure you really want to be right or win this debate or whatever but lets not get stupid here just because someone is goodlooking andor popular doesnt mean that they necessarily have access to regular sex with desirable women nor did i say that at least half the men i named had wives and children or girlfriendsformer girlfriends
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but shorter term yeah there are plenty of men who go through lengthy dry spells and still more commonly there are plenty of men who get some sexual fulfillment on occasion but are far from happy with their situation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre silly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol get all teh bitchesss did felix dennis become a selfmade multilionaire by selling drugs haha reminds me of that saying men have lost money chasing after women but men have never lost women by chasing after money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that means if you are capable of rape you cannot be an incel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you have no problem with dying a virgin oo arent you incel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,look roosh v is disgusting i wouldnt save his life if i had the means for it and he needed it same goes for rollo i have a very deep contempt for them a sort of contempt i reserve for dudes who steal the waiters tips roissy isnt so bad but hes an autistic fuck that gets on my nerves with his endless talks about alpha males and alpha posture and his neverending hatred for everyone who isnt an american whose ancestors got to america on the mayflower or some shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,man id love ounces
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but i still feel that the first season was the best one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was watching some new episodes lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hateful people from hateful subs are not welcome here i mean i feel like they dont think its bad when they do it because they think theyre pretty much shitting on people whove already saiddone something shitty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hateful people from hateful subs are not welcomed but they sure dont have trouble being hateful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what does that have to do with what tbp actually is in practice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,forgive my oversight three cheers for mgtow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes has the highest smv of all the strata of the fashion world no doubt about that but i never found myself attracted to her i wouldnt say no to her lel but she wouldnt be me first choice if i had a choice nor my third choice this would be my first choice nsfw a bit i guess shes even more beautiful in person i suppose this is her boyfriend hahaha isnt love beautiful lmaooo he looks like the average guys i went to high school with lel god im having such a girly moment now which is to say im envious as fuckkk d
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,miranda kerr slept with justin bieber really isnt he like years younger than her or something shit she wouldnt have ever looked at him twice had she crossed paths with a nonfamous justin bieber in wallmart haha well good for him that is one experience most men will never have
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lets call it hyperbole for the sake of satirization then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,red pillers come here and say they are averagelooking men and that they have good social skills but have been rejected by every woman theyve approached and they use terms like mating strategy and females and that shit doesnt happen irl with average nonsperg men at all there are dudes all over the world who are getting laid all the time and they arent even tall nor chiseled and red pillers say the world is a lonely rejection fest for anyone oo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fyi she said workaday not workday it means ordinary
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but somehow so many millions of other visible minorities dont blow themselves up or massacre innocent men women and children of course there are other contributory factors which play a part i would guess some kind of childhood abuse or emotional neglect is probably prevalent and maybe the abuse and discrimination they received came at a particularly bad time in their formative years in the same way as some guys turn into serial killers if they witnessed their mother suffer and die when they were a child while other people who had exactly the same experience turn out fine in any case were getting slightly off the beaten track here and the original point still stands the lack of identity and belonging is a major contributory factor in the radicalisation of young muslims the irony is that the more traditional muslim families are more likely to produce children who are productive members of society as the children grow up with a firm identity whereas its the more lax muslim families which generally produce the more problem children yeah so do millions of black hispanic and asian men but somehow we still dont see many john daos blowing up nail salons im outside the united states so im not going to pretend that ive got a firm handle on this however from the news reports ive seen and attitudes expressed by black americans online there does seem to be a very large degree of resentment and hostility towards their country and society there have been news reports of massive riots over police shootings and some cases of violent insurgency against police officers i find it interesting that you seem to think that brown muslim men being wholeheartedly accepted into white protestant or catholic culture is a similarly basic need to actual essentialslike housing social acceptance and belonging is a basic need feelings of social isolation are one of the worst experiences which you can have and lead to a negative spiral of downward spiral of mental health most of this stuff i already knew because hey what can i say i like reading about terrorists but im pretty sure all of this is fairly easily researchable and verifiable is it im not trying to be a wise guy but i would like to see sources on the likes of holmes getting laid regularly and frequently with desirable women if i remember correctly he was the guy who shot up the theatre and who looked obviously mentally deranged in his police mugshots and courtroom appearances im sorry but are you really trying to tell me that making friends generally fitting in and having the ability to get sex is a simplistic idea of culture and identity thats just in a particular social setting that doesnt necessarily assuage a deepseated need for a tribal belonging nor did i say that at least half the men i named had wives and children or girlfriendsformer girlfriends ive just never heard accounts of these guys having sex with desirable women some maybe do as sexual frustration is only a large factor in most of these incidents but there are obviously other issues at play as well having wives or former girlfriends doesnt preclude someone from being sexually frustrated or feeling like a sexual failure especially in some muslim communities where arranged and semiarranged marriages are the norm if you look at spree killers then the sexually frustrated likes of cho rodger breivik harpermercer and sodini are going to be the standard type i know that theres the obvious chicken or egg scenario with this but im not claiming that sexual frustration is the root cause of all these people flipping their lid but in my opinion its the largest contributory factor and the one most likely to tip a mentally disturbed man over the edge the big problem which society faces is that there is no realistic or reasonable solution to the problem and that well always have a subset of volatile and angry young men unless we can change the human genome
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,luv u
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no he made his money from publishing this was of course back in the before the internet pretty much half the publishing industry he owned he is the origin of the oftquoted if it flies floats or fornicates always rent it its cheaper in the long run and lets just say he lived by that haha never got married fucked a lot playboy models and shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,niiiiiiiiiiiiiice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im talking about trp in general not you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes the exquisite nuances of philosophical insights will live on as fine art
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one thinks they are hateful if they feel morally superior
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bouncers also dont like aggressive people that start fights but they have no problem beating them up progressives hate intolerant people but are intolerant against them this is not uncommon
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,everyone knows tbp is just a bunch of circlejerking and hate directed towards trp and anything that doesnt toe the third wave feminist party line the question this post asks is why tbp says its something different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because it clearly matters to a lot of people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,red pillers come here and say they are averagelooking men and that they have good social skills but have been rejected by every woman theyve approached just because a woman is average it doesnt mean she is going to want a man in her league especially if shes young she can easily get laid with chads because there arent that many hot women in the world and an average girl who takes care of himself aka isnt fat af can still get some alpha to sleep with her remember that the majority of red pillers are young men theyre like girls in their age group arent rushing to marry or find a boyfriend why would they they are in highdemand i cant blame them if i was a woman id take full advantage of it lol and sleep with as many chads as possible and females and that shit doesnt happen irl with average nonsperg men at all in real life average nonsperg men just get lucky and date a girl they know either from college work or through friends maybe red pillers have an higher than normal sex drive and want to take a sample from a lot of pussies i dont know all i know is that from what ive experienced the men who want to settle down quickly are either with a really hot girl or cant have a playboy lifestyle there are dudes all over the world who are getting laid all the time and they arent even tall nor chiseled lol women outside of the western world probably have lower expectations from men because lets face it their countries are shitholes they need men to survive thus you see attractive girls from brazil with old rich men hell ive met quite a few myself it always made me so sad here we have pretty girls that are stuck with a bunch of dudes who cant even walk without using a wheelchair i dont blame them its a mans world and girls need to do what it takes to survive it also makes me feel bad that im a broke ass and i cant change the world lol we should have a world like europe and america where women are free to choose their hookups and husbands of their own free will because they dont need men say the world is a lonely rejection fest for anyone oo casual sex is hard to get because most women arent looking for casual sex but will be open to casual sex if the dudes chad enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah i see thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what the fuck really men made money from publishing books this was of course back in the before the internet i wasnt even alive then lol yeah makes sense now with the internet you can get anything you want if you know where to look at i still cant download a model from the internet tho if it flies floats or fornicates always rent it yeah but at the end of the day he didnt come home to a beautiful loving wife
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you honestly think that fucking a drunk slut is rape lol what do you want a consent form signed and authored by the girls dad or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont personally advocate the rape of women did someone get laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would rather die a virgin than have sex with someone that doesnt have the ability to consent id only fuck sober girls that have the ability to consent lmao see thats why you dont get laid you cant read body language you cant read facial micro expressions so you dont even see it when girls are interested in you let me tell you something girls get drunk because they want to get laid when a woman is drunk her sex drive goes up her inhibitions go down her antislut defense is lowered and shes far more likely to want casual sex drunk than while sober women are coherent and can give consent to sex while drunk of course theres a difference between drunk and blackout drunk thats a no its morally and physically wrong and disgusting to take advantage of a woman who is so drunk she cant say no because shes unsconscious or whatever other reason ive had drunk girls on my lap while we were both sitting on a sofa alone and i didnt do anything because it was clear the girl wasnt down to fuck more likely to pass out lol you dont need a consent form to have sex you know that bro live a little you dont turn into a raging rapist when you get drunk women arent helpless creatures that need to be protected from their own sexual desires they want to get fucked its up to you to do the fucking or do the fapping and pussy is a lottttttt better than a hand can ever be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i know just wanted to let you know that not all guys who believe in trp believe in the most extreme bs that goes on in there im perma banned from the red pill because i disagree with their belief that young hot women are attracted to old men lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pussy is awesome i agree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sounds to me that its just being jovial poking fun at the gold digger stereotype youd know better than i do but thats what it is most often when i come across it rather than framing it with any particular ideology id say that whoever you end up with in monogamy there are things youre missing out on even if you get someone ripped rich and possessed of an amazing personality there will be someone out there better in some way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,af gets old do you expect him to stay single forever most men settle down sometime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have not often encountered it but i hope its common because it seems to imply that some women prefer good lays to luxury which is good for men getting married id imagine this sentiment to come from women who grew up more umc and with the idea that they should marry for love who then do so only to realize the umc lifestyle they grew up accustomed to is no longer possible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they married their alpha but he wasnt a rich alpha so settled on half the dream it is a more stable marriage than if she married a beta with money so superior in that way most people are not rich including alphas so it must be happening often enough but only with tameable alphas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do they say this in front of their men if they do its likely more joke than kernel of bitter truth if not then theyre expressing genuine regret over not having that slightlybetterthaneveryoneelseiknow lifestyle than women invariably lust for anyway i suspect its a sort of humble brag my husbands good enough to be the side dick worth having an affair for also lol arent i the edgy cool girl in the group willing to make light of my marriage tehehe but i love him tho but im still badass god i hate women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so questions did these women marry their alphas did they settle for only half of the female ideal are they worse than the women who settled for beta bucks no if she had married her alpha she wouldnt be thinking about giving her commitment to another man women who talk like this a revealing a big character flaw if their hypothetical marriage to rich guy doesnt mean anything so they can bang husband on the side whats so special about her current marriage that she isnt banging a hotter guy now the only point in talking like that is to point out that their husbands are good providers that its some how his fault she cannot buy a new car or vacation in france women who talk like that probably couldnt have married anyone richer either men like that generally have options and i dont see how a woman with that attitude would have set herself apart from her competition as anything other than a gold digger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it sounds like your typical alpha fucksbeta bucks only they got it backwards
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh for sure they are joking and the goal was to make people laugh but the element of truth is therei like money but i married for love i agree monogamy requires compromise no one is perfect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah its like how every other girl is posting memes about how they dont know why they dont just become strippers even though they know that realistically it isnt just free money it requires them to put up with a lot of male behavior they dont like market themselves in a uncomfortable way put themselves into unfavorable situations etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tameable alphas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,god i hate women we know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only point in talking like that is to point out that their husbands are good providers that its some how his fault she cannot buy a new car or vacation in france hmmm i think given your reaction this speaks to a difference in points of pride and values i and most of my friends were raised umc we are the daughters of college professors and business owners who are getting our masters in improv as therapy weve never gone hungry had the gas shut off weve never been at risk for eviction because mom and dad were there if we needed help while i get that some men may care the idea that one of my male friends pride would be hurt by being called a bad provider is kind of absurd to me call him unoriginal or question his taste in neighborhoods or whiskey ouch but sitting at a dinner party laughing about wanting to buy something stupid and his wife says my mom wanted me to marry an international finance major but this dick was too bomb and then they high five youre projecting disrespect and insult where there is none
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i beg to differ if shes true to her word then she indeed married her alpha but his income doesnt support the kind of comfortable lifestyle she wants bigger house frequent diningout more vacations shes essentially saying i married for lookssex and thought the money would take care of itself source my ex pushed for me to get a masters degree so she could enjoy a higher standard of living we were living in an apartment at the time and living mostly from paycheck to paycheck the only other alternative is shes simply bragging that she has a goodlooking husband and that hes more attractive than someone whos rich
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sounds like theyre just acknowledging that marriage can be fucking hard it would be nice to have all the sex and intimacy without the worryingaboutmoneythecatpeedontheflooragain bullshit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,alpha bux beta fux this is one the pillars that our glorious trp was built on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i usually hear women say i am happy my husband isnt too rich or handsome because then other women would pursue him and he would be inclined to cheat seriously that seems really hurtful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah there is normally some truth in humour its quite self assuring to know that you could have married for wealth or an easy life but you turned it down anyway its got a feelgood moral factor to it i have seen women in particular turn down those opportunities to be provided for materially the fact that theres a temptation gives some evidence for typical red pill thought but the fact that love whatever it is p triumphs so often is a very hopeful and beautiful thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tameable alphas yeah alphas that can be made to commit and stop cheatingmostly typically they are lower alphas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what a bummer negative take which i couldnt imagine without you remind me to never ask you to help lighten things up we all have our strengths mein freund making everyone else feel like shit just happens to be one of mine maybe it might be fun to imagine gold diggers paying for it for example this douche dom meme had me lmao its probably a stretch but fun anyway i think youre right ill go stretch my legs a little head over the park and focus my haterays on some random hardbodies maybe start internally plotting out ways i could isolate one and give her the punishment you all deserve that always makes me feel better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,white umc feminists classic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hmmm i think given your reaction this speaks to a difference in points of pride and values i and most of my friends were raised umc you are correct in that its showing a difference in pride and values i grew up lcwc and im sure it shows but having said that most of the women i know who are of the same class as i still have that mentality this is an attitude that transcends class says my mom wanted me to marry an international finance major but this dick was too bomb and then they high five youre projecting disrespect and insult where there is none if thats the case why say i should have married richer at all how else could that possibly be interpreted than i want something my current husband cannot provide regardless of social standing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yea sounds like a joke that isnt that serious to me like they clearly love the guy but more money would be nice as it is in almost every situation it reminds me of how i joke that i moved in with my boyfriend to be closer to work that totally isnt the case just a fun bonus
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,cuck cux is the one and only premise of tbp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its quite self assuring to know that you could have married for wealth or an easy life but you turned it down anyway its got a feelgood moral factor to it good point also it sounds like the type of joke women tell to lighten up a conversation involving financial struggles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,give her the punishment you all deserve maybe it would be more satisfying to look in the mirror and focus the anger on the real source of pain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,stereotypes exist for a reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the umc tends to be the most indoctrinated in a society they are the ones that benefit the most compared to the middle and lower class and have the most influence out of the non upper classes this primarily happens because they have more money and connections natural really it also does highlight how insatiable women are excellently easy for feminism to prey on this instinct
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but having said that most of the women i know who are of the same class as i still have that mentality this is an attitude that transcends class i dont think it does ime men in second generation umc at least in artistic circles dont tend to base their self worth on being a provider its a point of pride to pursue something that isnt as lucrative if thats the case why say i should have married richer at all jokes humble bragging lamenting a lack of a boat with friends how else could that possibly be interpreted than i want something my current husband cannot provide regardless of social standing because its not my husbands job to provide me all the things that i want everyone at the table knows that so we chuckle assign a single friend to marrying someone with a boat and open another bottle of wine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly men who get cuckolded are confident and secure in their masculinity it would take a lot to watch their wife sleep with another man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so i am confused have you heard other women saying i usually hear women say i am happy my husband isnt too rich or handsome because then other women would pursue him and he would be inclined to cheat or is that your singular take
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not all men are donald trump
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well if its a joke no but if someone actually believes that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,errsarcasm right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pfft lol nope
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men who dont are just insecure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is just flat bizarre and doesnt sound like the makings of a happy marriage at all being unthreatened by another womans proposition is my ideal i have no doubt my husband could find a woman to cheat with ive been well aware of his coworkers having crushes on him but cheating is just not in his nature he teases me that his monogamous nature would make him even more attractive if i ever leave him his best friend is also like that lots of men are
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah agree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes exactly i mean people who dont eat shit are insecure too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats the ideal isnt it a man who could cheat but doesnt its one of the things trp gets right imo women want men that are wanted by other women of course as usual they take it too far and turn it into women love hot guys who cheat on them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats difference eating shit is gross
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im having a good chuckle over here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being cucked is more gross
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its only gross if youre insecure eating poop can make you sick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being a cuck will make your wife divorce you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well no shell get the man she wants and ill get to watch
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i myself havent noticed that frankly ive seen in many cases homeless people outside of pizza shops and more often than not its a woman who is bringing out a few slices for the person sleeping on the street i cant really touch on the other points since i dont have a ton of experience talking to others about serial killers or spousal abuse but again many of the women i know are generally more likely to be sympathetic to the elderly and homeless i know many men who exhibit the same traits but i see it slightly more often with women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id say youre not paying attention to your surroundings ive seen both things in your title happen id also point out that aileen wuornos bothered plenty of people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yawn what a silly op i see women do these things i a woman do these things if you dont hang out with nicer people or stop seeing only what you want to see
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,identity politics the left frames women as the innocent nonharming gender and their actions are viewed accordingly to that identity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to be fair most men if offered a seat by a woman would refuse it because internalized misogyny or some such women are also too focused on themselves to give a flying shit about random homeless or disabled men theyre focused on how awkward will this guy make me feel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i actually see women give change to homeless people a lot my own mother gave a homeless man her lunch once i volunteer at the soup kitchen every thanksgiving and christmas i see plenty of women their when i take the bus i always see women give up their seats for the elderly i think you have some kind of bias because you hang around bitchy awalts who are narcissistic instead of nice little tame princesses you can ease yourself around with a female serial killer of men wouldnt really bother them yeah because male serial killers are so phased by their victims responses ill give this a and prescribe you with going outside
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,emma shes hot and i would make so much bank in the divorce two seconds after everything was final and i had my moolah and was settled somewhere tropical id text her a link to trp surprise im archwinger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you like a woman who gets filmed for the entire world to watch her getting double penetrated by two unfeasibly large cocks then a pornstar would be a good choice the likes of emma watson are feminists in name only im sure that her rugby playing boyfriend totally respected her feminism or maybe not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gender equality movement heforshe wait until you see it do you see it to stay married for at least years so its a given that its not forever and we can divorce later which likely means shell pay support from her millions since she makes more in that case it doesnt mater youre basically prostituting yourself for money then you choose between hotter slut and not so hot but young feminist pretty dumb girl who might be bitching about her views hmmm obviously no one is a marriage material but i guess in the context of future divorce a man can just choose the lesser of two evils ps sure if you talk to them might click with one and then the choice is more obvious but i assumed that we only know what we know about them from the internet and its kinda an arranged marriage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,probably emma watson she seems genuinely interesting shes outspoken not to mention very eloquent and shes an attractive lady i dont know her on a personal level but the times ive seen her speak i tended to agree im not against dating a porn star but i dont know anything about asa akira personalitywise and after a brief google search on looks alone shes not what im particularly into
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,um emma watson hands down i dont know what that possessed mannequin is doing walking the earth but someone should call an exorcist in unrelated news i think plastic surgery and massive amounts of makeup are gross as hell
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,emma watson is my flower its not even a choice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,marry hermione move to saudi arabia hopefully she gets executed for promoting witchcraft
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you have to choose or what at least make it interesting maybe i want option number maybe im not alone wed be a united front can you really make us if you have to choose fine asa akira shes a writer and shes had experience as a dom wed at least have something in common to talk about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,neither but emma
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,asa akira is also a feminist so id go with emma because i outgrew my attraction to asian girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rp asa akira easily her personality actually seems pretty cool i dont find emma watson attractive dont really get the reddit obession with her and her natural character seems uppity dont really dig her at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,watson she doesnt have videos of three dicks penetrating her at once she aint no sjw feminist she just thing women are neat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i had to choose asa akira and i honestly dont even know who she is but she wins by default
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i wouldnt pick one emma watson is a disgusting sjw type feminist i dont dally with porn actresses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,setting aside reverse divorce rape limiting it to a few years and having no kids as the result then akira i have no idea of what watsons sexual habits are but you can be pretty sure you would be in for a wild ride with akira red pill mostly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,emma whotf is this asa bitch thats your opinion of hot she looks like an alien or monster of some sort to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,interesting to see that some red pillers would wife up the ho when all the sub talks about is how unsuitable sluts are for ltrs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,asa akira seems fucking crazy based on the few amount of podcasts ive seen of her id have to meet her and see if she acts differently when a camera isnt on her i have dated a tumblr feminist before so i think emma would be fine im really good at dismissing people who are hyped on dumb shit like astrological signmyers briggs so im sure that i could easily bear her viewsseeing as they all have some level of truth behind them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hahaha this is actually really funny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she can have her pick of men shes gorgeous and filthy rich why the hell would she spend any time with a man if he wasnt a feminist oh you dont think women are as good as men chad its your turn to be arm candy bye chad it would be that simply when youre that hotfamousrich lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the likes of emma watson are feminists in name only shes a feminist ambassador for womens issues for the un kinda doubt its in name only
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wait until you see it do you see it i saw it also isnt that thing telling guys to be betas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes this wtf she is hideous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who would you rather marry you have to pick one and you would have to stay married for at least years this is just asking for people to say both in some order up the stakes make it for life cant leave even if you want to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,surprisingly emma watson is the one that acts like somethings up her butt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i were a man id go for watson especially because shes a feminist id enjoy dominating her in bed and telling her that no matter how much she blabs she knows shell always beg for some good cocking i will tease her and not allow her to cum until she admits that i am the man and that no matter how feminist she is still my little bitch and shell love it then ill slap her butt and tell her to make breakfast there is something appealing in the fantasy of making a woman my lady in the streets but whore in the sheets edit reddish pill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,unaffiliated id have to get to know them before deciding
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pls repost under automod this is a q for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pretty sure asa is mix
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pretty sure emma counts herself a feminist as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,doesnt fuck black guys whats the relevance of that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she aint no sjw feminist uh yeah she is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,asa akira is a porn star who does kinky porn thats the point of this post which is the lesser of two hot evils
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not hot but its a situation of juggling wild sex but promiscuity and more tamed conservative girls with the might of feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think theyd make an exception for an alist porn star thats like the ultimate status symbol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she can have her pick of men shes gorgeous and filthy rich why the hell would she spend any time with a man if he wasnt a feminist because sexual attraction is nonpolitical
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,emma watson looks good on paper asa akrias more down to earth thats basically the conundrum here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly telling them to do stuff for girls yet somebody dares to call it a gender equality movement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,having men not be violent to women is beta
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol shes married to you she doesnt have to fuck you one romp like that and youll be on rdeadbedrooms for the rest of your marriage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpwwwreactiongifscomrbspgif most feminists would not enjoy that at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes actually not she is actually more on the sane side unless you actually have proof she is more the sjw sort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i still pick asa
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh i think emma watson would be more down to earth im not going to assume anything about asa but a lot of porn stars have past sexual trauma drug addictions etc and just generally a lot of baggage plus emma is a goddess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes if course but isnt there more to that movement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah shed be my bitch writing erotica about us
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,judging by how many of them enjoyed the shades of something book i dont agree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought feminists were sex positive and all that and i think many if them have such fantasies of being dominated by a male despite the lip service
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,racism is a pretty trashy personality aspect if you ask me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont racebait
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that link may have totally changed my opinion of emma she just needs to keep the long hair
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre fooled way too easily theres an amareddit with asa she seemed pretty down to earth smokes pot since she was recognized a guy did it with when she was a preteen seems to have a relatively relaxed demeanor sense of humor about her profession emma is often hypocritical strident shes from brown so has a chip on her shoulderhigh strong has an attitude of do as i say not as i do women of status are society women theyre often high maintenance fridged etcbut exude social status asa seems like someone you could hang out with her personality would be more agreeable it doesnt mean that each doesnt have benefitsproscons it just depends on your personality are wiling to put up with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so men should be violent to women the movement is literally about getting men to be less violent to men just in a sexist manner go to the organizations website and see for yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they claim they are but its nothing more than an oxymoron
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not in such a grotesque way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she started doing drugs and having sex when she was yeah thats the kind of stuff im talking about emma has a ton of status and achievements shes as classy as you can get asa seems like the type of woman who can only talk about sex and drugs emma seems like the type of woman who can challenge you and hold a conversation about anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,should thats a weird word nobody should anything and my stance on that alpha beta stuff simply is that alphas often do unattractive shit shit that isnt good for you what works best do what an alpha would do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the movement is about having men as pawns for emma watson political ambitions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not even in the soft core way sex positive within feminism is an oxymoron
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,strike two on racebaiting knock it off or be banned
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not sex drugs she just occasionally did pot when she was a teenager you have to understand theyre for different personalities i understand both asas the type that could hang out with the guys play video gamessmoke pothave a beer with in ca without there being anything weird about it emmas gives off the impression of being a role model a renaissance women but the idealization probably doesnt match her personality or personal life shes steering the entire course of her career to legitimize her opinions on subjects she didnt have an interest in until it directly affected her she sounds like the type that would be difficult to tolerate in private life but would be amazing to be seen in public with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i had a mother thanks god so i dont need a mother figure to tell me what i should do and think now that im if i was forced i would go write the porn star
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my hero
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not sex drugs she just occasionally did pot when she was a teenager isnt a teenager and pot is a drug asas the type that could hang out with the guys play video gamessmoke pothave a beer with in ca without their being anything weird about it oh i think it would be the opposite she would be like amy shumer and not be able to stop making sex jokes and try way too hard to fit in shes steering the entire course of her career to legitimize her opinions on subjects she didnt have an interest in until it directly affected her shes been a woman her whole life so im pretty sure sexism has affected her her entire life also she has been a spokesperson basically her entire adult life she started speaking at feminist events when she was at brown university an ivy league school btw she sounds like the type that would be difficult to tolerate in private life but would be amazing to be seen in public with she sounds well educated interesting cultured and smart as hell i get why you wouldnt want to hang out with her but to me shes kind of my role model haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nobody really cares about pot these days that being said i too like emma watson
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pot is a drug so is advil she sounds well educated interesting cultured and smart as hell and rich which is just an equation to being uppity this is besides her already being british rather have the porn star really between the two
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree i love pot but i didnt start smoking until college and there are numerous studies showing that marijuana use before is terrible for mental development
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah is a little young i didnt start smoking until college either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for every guy who thinks one of the last two women i showed is unattractive there are who thinks she is beautiful and would gladly sleep with her mathematically this implies that at least of men think morbidly obese women are beautiful and would gladly sleep with them that is patently ridiculous sure there exist men who are into these women but they are a tiny minority of fetishists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,would bone consider beautiful theres a few men with an obesity fetish and theyre terribly outnumbered by the fat women most men are fine with dating below in looks because its all there is it doesnt mean its their first choice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,those women you posted all have symmetrical feminine faces are young and have large hips relative to their waists i doubt you can find as many admirers for appleshaped elderly women with disproportionate features the bias against high body fat in women is more cultural than innate look how many cultures have idealized fat women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the important thing to remember is that our standards of beauty are almost entirely socially programmed what we perceive as beautiful today is the cumulative result of millennia of human culture and it will continue to change our western standard of beauty is becoming more universal through globalization and mass communication but it wasnt always that way really the concept of thinness as beautiful is a very modern concept its only extremely recently in the scope of human history that thinness has been associated with wealth and fatness with poverty cheap nutrition is an incredibly novel concept thinness used to be associated with whereas wealth was associated with what wed today consider furthermore what we today consider sexy is not come by through a sustenance lifestyle lean bodies are achieved through pilates and yoga thick and luxurious hair requires modern products to treat etc our modern concept of a is the product of civilization not just genes where am i going with this well in ye olde villages before the beauty industrial complex had taken off and before mass communication was a thing your idea of beauty would have been radically different the most beautiful girl in your life and remember she wouldnt have makeup or pushup bras or a targeted workout routine or skincare or shaving products or any of that would probably be considered roundly average if that today nowadays were able to find our most beautiful individuals from around the world and beam them into everyones living rooms as aspirational icons not so for the vast majority of human history the bar was much lower thats all well and good but obviously obesity is always gross for most people right thats biologically hardwired not at all in obesity is preferred and theres evidence that it was once preferred in some early human settlements my point is that our concept of beauty has been artificially narrowed by culture in a more natural state men are attracted to a wider range of women than what would be considered attractive today they have to be for an average man not a king or ruler to be able to dismiss a woman as too unattractive to become his wife is a very modern concept it used to be you took what you could get you had to marry someone your family chose for you or whoever was available in your town no swiping left for uggos so yes someone who you personally consider unattractive will have other suitors the natural state of human beings without any grooming or modern trappings is by our modern civilized standards kinda gross if we turned our noses up at less attractive people all the time we would have died out as a species from an evolutionary perspective what is an obese person but someone with the best chances of surviving the next famine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this statement negates itself its an irrational statement its a completely meaningless statement without defining this premise the standard for beauty upon which claims are made there are others who think xyz you cannot make claims upon it or in relation to it because you have not defined xyz in this case beauty first of all this would require arriving at a premise a mutually agreed upon definition in this case the definition of beauty ie first we all have to agree on what is beauty in order to even establish a reference for the claim ie the premise in fact there is a project doing so creating the archetypical beautiful male female faces im too lazy to go find it maybe ill edit this comment and add it later even so the premise at this point if considering this project of beauty archetype would be negated bc here we have an objective determination of beauty to disagree would make one simply a deviation and perhaps not a good judge of beauty as it is agreed upon by those who were polled to determine this beauty archetype only then can we make claims about whether or not people agree that some people meet the definition of beauty or as op put it there are who thinks she is beautiful however the concept of agreeing or not on the definition negates the premise itself having an agreed upon definition of what actually is beautiful or attractive we cannot disagree with an agreed upon premise of the definition of beauty because then there would be no premise at all so this question by its very nature negates itself because it assumes that there is a premise of beauty which exists in the first place without defining this premise the standard for beauty you cannot make claims upon it or in relation to it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,first of all there is a significant difference between porn and reality and the bodypositive movement consists to of women telling other women how beautiful they are if you go into maleoriented spaces and ask about fat women body positivity or similar things you will still get a very unison answer fat is unattractive however there are men with fatfetishes which offer validation to these women sure but to say that bbw women are getting more and more popular is to stretch the truth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not sure about the math but i agree men have a wide variety of tastes whereas women are mostly attracted to the same thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that statement is too generous i would say that for every woman you would turn down because of looks there would be sufficient number of men thirsting after her so as to give her an inflated sense of her looks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do they really think they are beautiful though its like how you always tell a girl her pussy is tight we just say that shit i think you are confusing beautiful with i will say nice things to put my dick inside that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,more like for every man that thinks a woman is unattractive there are that would fuck her if no one knew out of those maybe one or two are of equivalent value and would date based on looks provided the rest checked out which i feel was more the vibe you were getting at
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive said this before and ill say it again men have way more varied tastes in women than women do in men despite the popular notion otherwise that being said those obese women have incredibly conventionally attractive facial features so im not sure theyre the best example to demonstrate that honestly i wouldve hoped most people on this board would have already gotten past the false notion that the absolute most unattractive thing a woman can be is overweight get real folks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in that article you linked the top porn stars listed under bbw are and now call me crazy but physically both of them seem to be leaning more towards the girl you showed in the first pic than the latter two all links nsfw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sorry that first girl you linked to distracted me and now i dont care about this post i wish that was what women meant when they said theyre thick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well maybe there are six who think theyre beautiful every parent and grandparent thinks their childgrandchild is beautiful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah while i agree with the ops message to some extent i dont believe its literally true i believe that most men are grossed out by morbidly obese women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre missing the much larger group of men who simply dont care that a woman is fat or for who its simply a less important feature a lot more guys than you think look at a woman who would be an at pounds and for them shes still an or maybe a at or whatever theres a range of nuance there too for me just as an example the second woman op posted is sexy but the third woman while pretty isnt attractive to me other guys draw the line at different places its the sirmixalot spectrum
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there exist men who are into these women but they are a tiny minority of fetishists and the women typically dont like being pursued by men who fetishise their fat although they may be reduced to take what they can get
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think what op is saying is that men have a variety of things that they find attractive whereas women have a lot less women for the most part like the same kind of guy whereas men are a lot more diverse in their tastes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,taking things too literally again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not only that but the fetish is a power and control fetish often combined with a death wish for the obeseoid not a sexual fetish
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i came here to write this post fucking maths
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mathematically this implies that at least of men ever heard of a figure of speech sure there exist men who are into these women but they are a tiny minority of fetishists if thats the case why is bbw so popular
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what else is beauty good for if it means you arent fuckable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the last women are apple shaped and gigantic their stomachs are huge the first woman is just has a big ass and big hips do you honestly think they are similar
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no men find overweight and obese women disgusting because that is a sign of poor impulse control bad character low iq and also is unhealthy and reduces fertility
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,cultures that have given any sex appeal to women the women were at most overweight as classified by modern medicine and this was at a time when it would be rare to see anyone over bmi or so no society has ever idealized anyone a figure with bmi
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the important thing to remember is that our standards of beauty are almost entirely socially programmed what we perceive as beautiful today is the cumulative result of millennia of human culture and it will continue to change this is true but this is an extremely misunderstood and misrepresented concept what a lot of people take this to mean is that a group of people saying something is beautiful or gorgeous such as fat fetishists will suddenly made that something beautiful to more and more people just because someone doesnt want to accept a beauty standard does not prove that beauty standard wrong or not accurate as you said this change happens on the scales of civilization entire freaking nations on the brink of starvation or the mauritania example the whole country agrees on whats beautiful if we turned our noses up at less attractive people all the time we would have died out as a species from an evolutionary perspective what is an obese person but someone with the best chances of surviving the next famine yes but referring to what i said above that famine isnt here so people do not care if people only thought about survival and evolutionary advantage software engineers would be drowning in pussy but thats obviously not the case
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre wrong there are countries that do not have this american obesity epidemic problem where teenagers do not look like olds and most women are actually sexually attractive for example eastern europe russia china japan korea etc fatness is not associated with poverty there nor is thinness associated with wealth yet lean naturallooking httpsenwikipediaorgwikipioneerplaquemediafilepioneerplaquesvg people are considered healthy and thus sexually attractive concluding that because people in america are all fat standards for beauty are a social construct comes off extremely closeminded and americacentric you talk about other cultures a lot but ironically only notice the us it is by the way a huge stretch to associate wealth with attractiveness it is much more believable that health is actually what makes a person attractive wealth is entirely a social construct lol finally that mauritania article you provided does not actually prove that fat is sexually attractive it only says that obesity is seen as a sign a husband cares for his wife which is true because if you have a fat wife in a fucking desert you must be that much badass
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one needs to define anything here beauty is a binary state you either think someone is beautiful or not if you are arguing something like everyone is beautiful in their own way your just deluding yourself its a coping mechanism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fat is unattractive this is crucial in countries where women are overweight there are more body positive and acceptance movements i once saw an article about people who are obese who give doctors cards about how doctors should not mention anything about their weight and how it is related to health they have convinced themselves they can be fat and healthy not impossible but certainly not common and i dont mean plump or curvy i prefer curvy women myself i mean they take up two seats on the bus fat men are pretty forgiving when it comes to her weight extra curves are great but she has to maintain some attractive waisttohip ratio i know some guys would say the woman by the pool is too fat for me shes chunky in the right places but i guarantee theyd take her over the morbidly obese women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is your evidence for this claim i mean look at the number of wildly different ways that men on this sub describe chad half of them are going on about how he makes and the other half are talking about how hes a drug dealer who lives with his mom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you have a source
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly and this is what created the incel and forever alone phenomenon after the sexual liberation and still the western society officially still pretends and functions as if there is such a thing as male privilege and discrimination against women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont agree with op but i agree that men seem to be attracted to variety more than women of course he can dip in one woman and an hour later be balls deep into another as if nothing happened so its not an investment but it makes sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people jerk off to bbw porn its a market presumably people are not jerking off to porn because they are hoping that the porn will let them put their dick inside it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lmao yea desperate men that havent had their penis touched in awhile nobody likes fat girls everybody settles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rgonewild has subscribers rgonewildplus has subscribers make of that what you will
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are too lenient with women in every regard beauty morals skillseverything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it states a little further down in the article that this catches things googled with bbw when you search carmellas name with bbw at the end comes up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yea she is pretty hot in my opinion too gotta love that ass
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and most importantly the men who are attractive to women are more likely to be grossed out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even overweight women are pretty gross
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sir mix a lot liked women with a big butt and a small waist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is so disgustingly morbidly obese in my experience thats well past when people stop being able to properly engage in the physical act of sex the only person who would not have a preference against this is someone who didnt know better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly thats kinda dumb in my opinion why would you not want to be with a guy who thinks your body is sexy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and the women typically dont like being pursued by men who fetishise their fat rchoosingbeggars haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont really think thats true some girls like buff bodybuilder guys and other girls like skinny guys in bands
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe sometimes but i think the majority of the time this is not the case some guys just find fatness sexy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if thats the case why is bbw so popular because there are billions of men in this world and the internet connects them all even though guys into bbws are a minority its still easy to find them on the internet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can find porn of every niche fetish on the internet you can find sneeze porn and balloon porn and dragons fucking cars porn it doesnt mean that its a majority taste
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres a figure of speech and theres literally mixing up the two numbers you have in your thread title its more like for every guys who would find a woman inattractive would think she is beautiful when it comes to bbw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fetishes in fat chicks are normally considered fetishes because they are abnormal you have the math all wrong for every fat chick guys consider hideous will consider her beautiful and another may use her as a cum dumpster
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ever heard of a figure of speech ever hear of math
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being fuckable doesnt mean being beautiful being beautiful means men will do all sorts of shit to fuck you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a straight woman i do think those women are decently attractive maybe i would feel differently if i saw them naked but their faces are cute and yeah their boobs and butt are a nice proportion are they models just wondering these look like model photo shoot pics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fat cells dont lower your iq theres no correlation between weight and iq lol thats not how that works

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no culture ever really are you sure you want to make such an absolute statement it can be refuted with even httpswwwvicecomenusarticlethefatfarmsofmauritania gotta love that ohsological armchair anthropology
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and fat fetishists have not made fat beautiful in western society they remain a relatively isolated group however the body type we find beautiful today think kim kardashian is very different and yes curvier than what we found beautiful years ago think kate moss like heel height and skirt length it changes with the economy no the next famine isnt barreling down on us but were still hardwired both mentally and physically to prepare for it theres a reason the genes that cause us to readily gain weight have survived this long in our history anyone who didnt have them died off we get fat for a very important reason and our lizard brains havent entirely forgot that reason and no programmers would not be considered attractive if people only thought about survival theyre sedentary and have no real world survival skills any wealth they accrue is entirely artificial and needs a fiat economy to have worth strong guys who do physical work and could fight off invaders would be considered most attractive in a sustenance economy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,struck a nerve
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,be civil
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no its not what people find beautiful is subjective just like how taste in food or drink is subjective some people like coffee others hate it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dude google all of the things that women are stereotyped for being attracted to height looks money outgoing personality high social status being a bad boy and you will find countless studies that prove this to be correct seriously just google all of them and for the record i dont think anyone would define chad to be a rich but ugly dude chad is almost exclusively defined as a goodlooking tall guy with an asshole personality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are a lot google search male height attractiveness male outgoing attractive male looks attractiveness i just dont feel like doing it right now but there is a ton of evidence all over the place that women like tall height outgoing personalities authoritative figures high earners
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly men have to either conform or go sexless well there are other options but all of those are made out to be taboo to keep men in line
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think that those are mostly just people who watch so much porn that they start drifting towards fetishes to keep shit fresh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im on all sorts of fat girl sites and the supplydemand imbalance is fucking shocking half of them outright demand a rich fit chad usually using typical woman code language like ambitious and not into bigger guys just personal preference based on the amount of attention they all get the site has a social component fat women are not wanting for chadlike suitors as an aside there is doubt in my mind that the bbw fetish has grown among men in recent years alongside other perversions like becoming a trap or tranny due to three reasons sexual marketplace realities less goodlooking women available so men branch out into weird shit culture of shame around sexuality weird shit starts to happen when its all in secret the proliferation of internet porn eventually men get desensitized and start looking at some weird shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you underestimate fetish communities httpswwwredditcomrimmobile httpswwwredditcomrdyingtobefat theres a pound minimum there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this comes up whoa wtf
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,isnt big just curvy like the girls he had in the videos
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes representing a point on the spectrum i dunno maybe it would be better names the freddy mercury spectrum because gay and bi guys have diverse preferences too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is so disgustingly morbidly obese in my experience thats well past when people stop being able to properly engage in the physical act of sex that is well within the range of what i consider attractive and i speak from repeated firsthand experience when i say youre simply wrong the only person who would not have a preference against this is someone who didnt know better au contraire an aesthetic preference is one thing but regarding physical capabilities you are the one who appears to not know any better youre welcome to your preferences but dont try to justify them with objectively falsifiable assertions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they want to be loved for their person i think not some superficial thing like their copious corpus same with asian girls whining up and down on the internet about guys with yellow fever personally im happy about all the girls with whitefever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all poodles are dogs not all dogs are poodles still doesnt make beauty fuckable inaccurate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a straight woman i do think those women are decently attractive since you are a straight woman why does your opinion matter
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think women just look at things completely differently than men when it comes to judging fat people it seems like women judge fat people more for what theyre doing with what they have while men look more at the overall picture ive seen this a lot in other subs as well when a fat woman is being ripped on very often youll see women come and talk about how cute they think she is just something ive noticed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,reply already i want to laugh at you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just to clarify are you referring to the first womanby the pool or the last two
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,moral iq then its indulgent and sloth like to be fat and proud
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do you millennials think that peer reviewed official holy science is some kind of replacement for logical reasoning its embarrassing im embarrassed for you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,congratulations youve shown that my hyperbole wasnt factually correct also im pretty skeptical of this type of reporting are women like this considered good in this culture because fatness means she has food and thus we wont starve or is it genuinely attractive like guys are saying wow her fat rolls make my dick hard im guessing its likely the former rather than the latter
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,kim kardashian beautiful 😂
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gay men made kate moss a model not straight men straight men through history have always liked the same things and no matter how big the parts are the waist has to be small as possible kim k is thick but her waist is tiny i mean smaller than a lot of naturally skinny womens waist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol k im going to go workout and lift now have fun when the mods see all your comments i reported
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh i didnt even mention that you can tell a fat person is lazy just with a glance theres not even any reason to get to know a fatty you already know that they are lazy have poor character have bad impulse control that they are low iq health problems not to mention ugly inside and out plus ive found that when im my regular fun happy nice self to fat women they will also become delusional and start fantasizing about dating me they start buying me gifts and finding ways to hang out with me by pretending to be my friend so fatties are liars as well and then when they see you hitting on and flirting with non fat girls they get all butt hurt and upset so they are delusional as well really there isnt anything at all that is positive about being a fat but dream on about your magic utopia where fatties are assigned high status so other women think better of them cause guys still wont care and will still find your fat body gross
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and based on your grammar your input is pretty low value to me then dont comment on my post thanks its funny you think your own input is so high and mighty when your only tactic is a personal attack
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah that whole protect is silly its like polling a whole bunch of people for their favorite foods putting them all in a blender and claiming this is the best taste because it is what everyone likes all other flavors shall be judged relative to this objective standard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant tell if your a troll or your an angry mgtow coming here to vent im sorry your feeling down today bud i have bad days too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you google all of the things that men are stereotyped for being attracted to you will also find countless studies that prove that they are attracted to them clearly exceptions exist for both men and women true chad is often defined as goodlooking although there seems to be some debate about whether height is more important than facial attractiveness but theres considerable debate about whether hes rich and goodlooking or a drug dealer and goodlooking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are we not talking about physical attraction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why dont you find women who dont want to conform as well or are you not attracted to them genuinely just wondering can you give me an example of how you dont conform
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to conform is not even an option to a lot of those men they have no choice but to remain alone and sexless the other options are either already illegal or they are soon going to be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people are attracted to weirder shit now than they were in the past having crazy fetishes is becoming the new norm in some cases
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,subscribers this is a tiny sub and it has
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i dont less then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats literally what im saying people imply that ass men are into women who are lbs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,morbidly obese people rarely move gracefully anyone who believes otherwise must have some kind of problem with identifying normal human movements
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not mutually exclusive a guy can have a sexual preference for fat girls and still care about the other traits of the women he dates
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think were agreeing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think they are working well with what they have i just think they are working well i know my face isnt that attractive and my hair isnt that sleek but again i think they are models so it makes sense that they are more attractive than a typical fat girl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the one with the pouty lips in the black swimsuitlingerie thing and the one in the colorfulblue thing with bangs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont like big butts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i understand youre very emotional about this subject you should start your own thread since youre quite off topic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol you already know fat people have low iq plz provide some sauce showing a correlation of increased weight to decreased iq because im pretty sure thats not how that works
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he doesnt need to be rich or a drug dealer he just needs to be an asshole
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wasnt talking about just physical attraction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wasnt talking about me im not faincel as far as conformity women want guys that are taller than them who are agreeable will treat them like princesses are not needy have socially acceptable jobs and have high social status thats the minimum for marriage for hookups they need to be fun dress well outgoing and sexually aggressive i previously conformed to hookups when i did i slayed ive never conformed to the marriage ideal i just cant be the agreeable guy that women want me to be i dont have it in me i cant kiss their ass like all of my other guy friends do theyre not princesses and i wont treat them as such
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if they play by societal rules basically become the fun entertaining guy then they could do okay im not advocating this but thats how it is other options include prostitution which yes is illegal this includes lesser forms of prostitution like sugar daddytype stuff another option includes leaving the country to have children they could do surrogacy and egg donation of course all of this would require money and most faincel types dont have that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is all it takes though think about it this way if you had average looking girls constantly messaging you and telling you how good you look and wanting you to fuck them would this make you believe your smv is very high
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how many fat girls have you had sex with ive had sex with a lot of them and a fair number of skinny girls and everyone in between and barring some other physical issue like bad joints there is very little that being overweight actually prevents anyone from having amazing sex no i cant pick them up and fuck them against the wall but again have you tried that yourself even if she weighs pounds that will wear you out way too fast to be worth it most of the time unless youre fucking in front of a camera crew dont get me wrong its hot and fun but not exactly something i feel like im missing out on so unless you have actual experience to argue against the overwhelming anecdotal data i have maybe you should stop speculating on a subject you know nothing about and trying to present it as fact
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no fat girl is attractive at all this is some girl delusion you know what guys think when they see a fat girl with a pretty face we think how fucking sad what an utter waste if only that girls mom or dad had told her to lose some god damn weight she might actually be pretty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,those two are enormous literally gigantic how can you think thats hot having her on top during sex would crush your pelvis the first one looks like most rappers wives typical big ass black girl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that does absolutely nothing for me mate looking at kim k makes my dick as flaccid as a dead worm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpswwwquoracomisthereacorrelationbetweenobesityandintelligence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,apparently your a new user here im a male obvious from my previous posts personal attacks are against the rules here hence your last comment being removed but obviously you didnt read the rules
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am glad you have your own personal definition of chad but my point is that many people here disagree about what a chad is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive been told that my boyfriend who i frequently describe here as literally the nicest person ive ever met in my life is a chad because he was able to have casual sex in college clearly not everyone shares your definition
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok well i disagree with you ok cupid had a blind date app and found the data for the people who had actually used the blind date app found once they got to the date they had a good time more or less regardless of how goodlooking their partner was httpsblogokcupidcom and people tend to date others who are pretty equal to them according to one study mcclintock found that outside of ailing tycoons and donald trump in the practical world it basically doesnt exist where it does it doesnt last the dominant force in mating is matching what appears to be an exchange of beauty for socioeconomic status is often actually not an exchange mcclintock wrote but a series of matched virtues economically successful women partner with economically successful men and physically attractive women partner with physically attractive men the study concludes that women arent really out for men with more wealth than themselves nor are men looking for women who outshine them in beauty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well luckily not all women are like that i know im not i actually get annoyed when guys are too over the top im from the south and im a feminist it happens a lot so try to find a woman who is down with equality i know a toonnnn of low status men with sos one of my friends is a nurse her boyfriend is a dj yeah he plays raves idk as long as he makes her happy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is all it takes considering of them are overweight i dont think the math adds up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i do have actual experience with fat people they move all super slowly their movements are not graceful or precise and further theyre much harder for me to move in any kind of graceful or precise way im surprised that someone is actually arguing this because from my perspective saying that fat people are unable to move normally is like saying water is wet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hmmm well obviously not very many men agree with you considering how common it is for fat people to have sos in the us of women and of men are overweight obviously its not just the top of people who get sos so idk they cant be that unattracted to fat people plus as the post states bbw is a common fetish
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yup exactly that how sad that shes letting her beauty go to waste
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are they models though doggy is where its at anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hu you dont like butt padding under clothing what an amateur
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so there is a correlation between obesity and things like dementia thats not iq try again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,casual sex with hot girls easily that is what makes a chad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was able to have casual sex in college and im confident that i can go out to a bar and at least get a make out fairly easily im definitely not a chad this is not what a chad is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre not disagreeing with me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a dj isnt low status hes a bad boy so she probably just likes bad boys also i cant know by reading this if youre friend is a quality woman i would need to delve more into her background to know this for sure and what do you mean by equality this is the vast majority of women that i come in contact with even proclaimed feminists with high status jobs i have yet to meet a woman in her that doesnt want to be treated like a princess and doesnt want an agreeable husband with feminists of course come other problems like their inability to cook and clean and putting off kids until theyre too old to have them not all but enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe youre thinking of people who are way more overweight than i am thinking of a previous serious girlfriend was over pounds for a couple of years of our relationship and our sex life was phenomenal i have had sex with women all over the weight spectrum and there is a point where it starts to actually interfere with good sex but it is around a bmi of in my experience based on your phrasing and further theyre much harder for me to move in any kind of graceful or precise way im going to guess you work in some sort of nursing or physical therapy related job maybe your problem is youre only used to working with people who also have other issues interfering with their movement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,common lol according to the internet and omg those statistics horrible if those couples really loved each other they would lose some weight to make their partner happier
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre a straight woman stop
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they are plus sized models make up and clothing that covers the unattractive bits makes them look nicer than they really are i appreciate bigger women but those two are way too big even with doggy it is too much they need to go on a diet and hit the gym
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she has butt shots
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,be civil or be banned
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,depends on what you mean by easily i guess he was not the type to just snap his fingers and get a girl to drop her panties he also wasnt the type to pursue tons of casual sex and generally preferred relationships but when we met he had a fwb thing going on with an attractive girl id wager at least of the guys i know could say the same at some point in their lives they cant all be chads unless were dilluting the definition of chad to the point where its basically meaningless which is what ive been saying all along
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree with you but there are others on this sub who would say we are wrong as no nonchad man can get laid casually thats the point ozy was trying to make despite your personal definition the concept of chad is wildly distorted and disputed around here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am saying women go on dates with guys that arent automatically taller richer and better looking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hes low status by anyones standards he doesnt even have a car she legit picks him up and drops him off but hes actually a super cool guy so whatever makes her happy you want someone to cook and clean up after you are your arms broken if thats what you want hire a maid as far as her being a quality woman i think she is but its a little ironic that you are complaining about guys have to conform to find someone oh wait but is she a quality woman you will date the same type of person you yourself are for instance if you cant cook or clean what type of woman will be happy going out for every meal and living in a pig sty a type of woman who also doesnt like to cook or clean so yeah if you dont want to be the stereotypical good husband dont expect a stereotypical good wife
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i dont work with handicapped people or anything like that i wrote that because i am very movement oriented during sex i like to pick women up toss them around carry them flip them over etc etc it is much more difficult to do this with someone with excess body fat do you dance much someones ability to dance gracefully is generally a good indicator of how finely they can move their body and generally fat girls just dont move the same as fit girls anyway the idea that humans only lose the ability to move gracefully around bmi is so absurd that i feel like youre debating in bad faith andor trolling me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well apparently their partner is happy with the way they look or they wouldnt have gotten together in the first place plus losing weight can be really difficult and if you do it safely you shouldnt be losing more than a week which is a year at best its a slow process dont get into a relationship expecting your partner to change if weight is a deal breaker for you try meeting women through the gymsports teams
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats what i thought i dont get why you would make a post basically saying i cant believe people are attracted to women like this and use models being attractive is kind of what models are known for
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never seen a candid shot of her bare ass
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so hes not chad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes but they will all jump at the chance to go out with these guys they settle for what they can get seriously if you dont believe this do an experiment of your own and create a fake profile on dating sites you will see that what i say is true
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you want someone to cook and clean up after you are your arms broken if thats what you want hire a maid why pay for something when i could get it at home for free personally i am a good earner i want a woman that complements me as far as her being a quality woman i think she is but its a little ironic that you are complaining about guys have to conform to find someone oh wait but is she a quality woman you will date the same type of person you yourself are for instance if you cant cook or clean what type of woman will be happy going out for every meal and living in a pig sty a type of woman who also doesnt like to cook or clean so yeah if you dont want to be the stereotypical good husband dont expect a stereotypical good wife quality in terms of how it relates to our possible marriage and raising our children does she believe in discipline or will she let the kids run wild has she had a lot of sexual partners in the past does she have a history of poor decision making at best based on what little i know it sounds like your friend does not make the best decisions by dating a guy that is basically a bum so that would be something i would think about if i were in a position to date her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wrote that because i am very movement oriented during sex i like to pick women up toss them around carry them flip them over etc etc we have something in common it is much more difficult to do this with someone with excess body fat actually its really not significantly harder maybe you just need to lift more bro do you dance much as it happens i do someones ability to dance gracefully is generally a good indicator of how finely they can move their body and generally fat girls just dont move the same as fit girls apparently you dont dance much with fat girls because in my experience again barring other movement inhibiting health problems which are admittedly more common among overweight people they move and dance just as well as skinny girls anyway the idea that humans only lose the ability to move gracefully around bmi is so absurd that i feel like youre debating in bad faith andor trolling me what i said there is a point where it starts to actually interfere with good sex but it is around a bmi of in my experience what you said anyway the idea that humans only lose the ability to move gracefully around bmi is so absurd this is so clearly a perfect example of a straw man argument that it could be used as a lesson in a debate class and then you have the audacity to accuse me of debating in bad faith in the same paragraph
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i agree but like i said ive been told that he is based on no other info besides he had casual sex for some people here the bar for what makes a guy chad is ridiculously low
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just dont see it happening in real life my girl friends arent jumping at the chance to date rich guys and none of my guys friends who are in relationships are wealthy either people tend to date people similar to them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats what the article is saying women will jump at a chance to go out with guys better than them just like men will but market forces make people settle for their match people end up with like people if you like a certain type of girl you need to be the bait be the person you want to attract
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah he is kind of a bum but she makes with no intention of having kids so its not like she needs a big earner like i said hes funny and cool so whatever makes her happy im just pointing out that not all women need the qualities you listed above its fine to have allll those standards its not fine to have standards that you dont have for yourself thats all im saying especially the few sexual partners thing if she had a certain view on sex she probably wont be into a guy who has acted in a different way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont understand you are criticizing women for having all these high standards and yet when i tell you my friend has much lower standards you say you would never date her because if she has low standards
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good sex requires graceful movement if shes just flopping all around as fat people often confuse with graceful movement it isnt good sex fat people often think they move just like everyone else but the plain fact is that their slow and uncontrolled movements are kinda gross
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its obvious that you value your own opinion far more than any reality or facts and despite my extensive experience having sex with overweight women i will never convince you that you are incorrect im out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,removed does not seem like you are interested in having your view changed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why should people be fatalistic millions of people grab the bull by the horns and change their fortunes everyday this is just more proof fa and inceldom are character deformations
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree losers should know their place shut up quit clogging my internet with drivel go jerk off play some video games and drink beer its not that bad of a life quit bothering women im sick of hearing women complain about loser men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,now this is just stupid by the time youre the malefemale ratio is pretty damn positive for men stay in good shape for an old dude and you can have half the nursing home on your dick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we all die alone no one ends up in that pine box with you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think we as a society need to accept that because there may be obvious consequences of that belief maybe these people are difficult to work with or are less ambitious maybe these people do not conventional political views maybe these people are difficult or confusing to live near in other words they are not the problem societys reaction to them is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they have already accepted it it is the pilltards who cannot accept it because it goes against their just world instead of suggesting ways to remove women from their lives normals try to send the incels back into the trenches to further self destruct
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed not just them but everyone needs to accept the black pill reality is not pretty reality is not fair all of your fairy dust notions of reality are bullshit equality is a myth and egalitarianism is a joke
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this type of thinking is a great way to boost the amount of school shooters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well they should go and try to improve themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some people do not have the attractiveness or the social skills to ever find love and romance this kind of attitude can just as easily be the result of narcissism and an inflated sense of ego as anything physical
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why cant they just use prostitutes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,meanie
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,damn thats like optimistic almost would not expect that from you lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep this thread just supports the idea that incels are only victims of themselves if op wants to go full on mgtow and never enter into a sexual relationship with a woman he can but he should at least have the balls to admit hes in that position due to his own choices not because of genetics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no a few people grab the bull by the horns and change their fortunes and inspired by them a million people start patting themselves on the back for getting a job and eating fewer hamburgers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wouldnt be the worst thing in the world
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can confirm working in aged care wasinteresting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol truly the longcon
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sweet ill bet the dumpster is the greatest chance at free food as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and yet somehow that just never ends up happening
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is it a problem with their interpretation of involuntary
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all i hear is waahhh wahhh wahhhhhhh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dude this is what the fuck is wrong with talking to incels they ask a goddamn question and you answer it and then they decide to move the goalposts the op asked whether incels needs to resign themselves to dying alone i said if they can manage to stay alive to old age then no way the gender ratios are incredibly positive for men in old age and then the effing whining starts waaaaa waaaa waaaa how can you expect me to go for an old lady when im an old man i want hot young year old girls as though the original question didnt exist to start with seventy is not an unreasonable age for a man to live to if unlike most men he decides to proactively take care of his health when you are seventy if you are in any sort of reasonable health and deign to look at women your own age you will be able to get your dick sucked and a cup of tea fetched for you anything pretty much anything you do to help yourself before then will have the effect of either lowering the age of women you can get or lowering the age at which you start being able to get women or both if youre not doing a lot of things to help yourself get sex sooner and on better terms then you are volcel not incel meanwhile im a woman and no matter how well i do at being sexy chances are i die alone because thats just how it works the better i look after myself and the longer i live the more likely i am to die alone i sorta get punished for taking care of myself and im coping with that idea because unlike male incels im not a putrid sack of shit nohoper who just gives the hell up despite the way time means he just has to hang in there and some sort of minimal success will come his way and then expects the rest of the world to acountersign that his surrender is sensible and baccept the blame for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it was pretty much how things went in the old folks home my grandmother was in the dining room she was assigned to had ten tables of four and at one stage all single men in that dining room decided to always sit at her table she always arrived early to meals because she was sparkling and witty and fun the other old birds just about lynched her for hogging the men staff had to intervene and shove two tables together to make a table for six she could sit at so other women could get their share men are such pathetic wusses about this die alone stuff considering that in general to not die alone all they have to do is take care of their health well enough to survive past age which like most of the things incels seem to have trouble doing is stuff they should be doing anyway for their own sake before sexual success is even factored in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes because its not involuntary its i cant be arsed which is fine tbh whatever just stop whining about how oppressed you are when its your own actions putting you in that position
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly privileged folks with easy lives like you not only lack perspective you actively refuse to consider it and when someone tries to point it out you clamp your ears shut and screa all i hear is waaaah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pft i talk to em all the time here of the time they want validation and to be heard they want mommy to pat them on the head and say its ok you tell them the work ahead of them crickets want to act like a normie put in the work of a normie ill be there to help a guy crawling out of the mud ut i aint about to convince him that mud isnt a good thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see any indication that the men in your grandmas nursing home had been incel before growing old all im seeing so far is just another attempt to play down the issues faced by undesirable men because apparently you have some kind of bias against them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol privileged
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,quite literally all the men in the nursing home were in demand or in a relationship thats just how nursing homes work unless youre saying incels never make old bones this means incels get a good time of it in nursing homes all im seeing from you is the usual attempts to be a perfect failure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes privileged
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,unless youre saying incels never make old bones actually yeah theres a good probability that they dont loneliness has demonstrated negative health effects and as those pile on as an old and lonely person the motivation to go on also suffers the oldest incel ive known was and afaik he didnt live to although im certainly willing to see some counterexamples men who lived their whole lives alone and unloved managed to stay alive managed to stay healthy managed to somehow get into a nursing home and then find love and sexual success there obviously you have no such examples because this whole idea of yours stems not from some kind of knowledge but from a simple desire to dismiss the problems faced by undesirable men because you hate them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if it didnt more men would leave to nail other women and not take care of their children
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i believe thats true marriage and having children does civilize young men and make them less likely to commit crime but id deal with the fucking mafia long before id ever be willing to deal with the family court system
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wonder how much stress hormones play a role testosterone peaks in the morning after youve been sleeping and i can tell you fathers get a whooole lot less sleep
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we are all a product of our environment this morning my environment consisted of a power rack in which i did squats sumo dls and some badass hip thrusts with a bar and plates so much test its like im a teenager again even though im still dont want to abandon my children mentorship is a big source of life fulfilment for me point is lots of testosterone doesnt automatically turn someone into a uber alpha widow maker who sets children up like franchises caregiving amping up his sensitivity to his childrens needs hint of bias thats the mothers job ive been on both sides of the sensitive parenting nobody not even dear ol mommy acts like they should if daddy aint in the dominant role leading appropriately
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe the guys that did have excessive t levels did just that there would need to be a study contrasting fathers active in the childs life and those who arent to see if there is a variance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,marriage and having children does civilize young men and make them less likely to commit crime but id deal with the fucking mafia i found this interesting considering mafias are families are they not and they sure do commit a bunch of crime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the wild where there is no welfare state men who dont stay around to look after their kids tend to have lots of kids who die before adulthood its an obvious adaptation to evolutionary pressure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do you know your testosterone levels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,idgaf how you started your morning ive worked out way harder than you for years and im still a funny cool competitive sweetie
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe if you leave your progeny to nail other women your kids are less likely to survive thats the first thing that comes to my mind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a question of ability completely making up numbers here if a fatherless embryo only has a tenth of the chance of surviving to adulthood that an embryo with a supporting father has its only biologically advantageous if the man can have at least ten times as many fertilisations by switching partners than he can by sticking to the same one given that it would be disadvantageous for women to be fertilised by a man they werent certain would stick around hed have to put a lot of effort in and most men probably wouldnt be able to do it on the flipside of this an unattractive man might be able to get a better mate than hed normally achieve by supporting an abandoned mother and her child a more workable strategy might have been to pick a primary mate and invest resources in her and those children while also venturing outside the relationship once your primary mate is pregnant and dependent on you you could also try picking a woman with a single mother sibling which might work if you are rich in resources but also unappealing a strategy only gives an advantage if you can make it work
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like it might bring high levels down to normal full disclosure did not read article
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the study revealed that fathers who spend three hours a day with their children have identifiably lower t than fathers who do not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the treatment and manipulation of men by the family court system is a property crime and your wages will get garnished or you get thrown in jail if you dont comply with that property crime so in reality the mafia and family court arent as distinguishable as one might think
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,blood test the rest is bullshit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,random and constant erections operators beard large muscles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can go and do a test in the clinic but there are easier ways to tell your t levels just by looking at yourself strong jaw low fat levelshigh muscle levels deeper voice high libido etc etc some studies suggest ratio of point finger and ring finger longer your ring finger is you got more t in the mothers womb
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is weird how i have managed to go to the gym all these years and remained a girl without a beard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is absolutely why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh come on thats such a histrionic response
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but hormones are weird isnt it the free levels that count or do you have to test shbg levels too ive never gotten an adequate answer to this question
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sorry those cant actually tell you much about your levels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,love me some bro science strong jaw low fat levels defined jaw equals low bf and thats more likely to come from high thyroid hormone levels than from testosterone high muscle levels myostatin activity and levels matter more than testosterone here deeper voice dht mostly ive had low voice all my life low t high dht high libido more influenced by dopamine than testosterone unless youre deficient ratio of point finger and ring finger only indicative of what you had inside your mother not in life tldr do research or gtfo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,longer your ring finger is you got more t in the mothers womb the ladies on the irc recently did this many of us apparently got more t in the womb than we thought
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so tru
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know thats an extreme metaphor but still the family court system is a manginarun shitstorm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,generally free testosterone is more important than total they test it directly or you could very precisely calculate them knowing the total and shbg levels in my experience the bare minimum to test a mans sex hormones is total testosterone shbg estradiol lh and prolactin additionally fsh for fertility concerns and dheas if the diet is low in saturated fats thats for men for women ive no idea
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope but theyre fun
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,defined jaw equals low bf and thats more likely to come from high thyroid hormone levels than from testosterone low body fat doesnt make your jawbones bigger signed natty with nazijaw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bullshit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought it was difficult to test free levels is it not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gives it a good definition though mines big but covered by fat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,technically the test itself is more difficult and expensive but most labs can do it just fine once again there are a lot of online calculators httpwwwissamchfreetestohtm which give very good and precise results this might not be the case for women though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women cant fuck a psychological concept chad exists or he doesnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chad is the rp bogeyman used to scare omega incels lift your weights or chad is gonna fuck your pretty little gf right in the ass and shes gonna love it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chad was originally meant to serve as a reminder of your shortcomings and inferiority and thats it incel types like to use chad to stress their opinion that self improvement with eventual sexual success in mind is futile redpill types might use chad to stress the competitiveness of the sexual marketplace the importance of increasing your smv etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would like to add one thing that i find very important chad doesnt need to offer commitment favours or excessive courting to sleep with women which is why on one hand i think chads are real however i am unsure of how many women actually sleep around or if there are enough chads around to be an issue to most men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you mean that chad mcchaderson is not real the most chaddliest chad that ever did chad now i dont know what to believe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all i can think of when you make this post are hanging chad fat chad and pregnant chad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure chad is a concept and not an actual person but even with that in mind it still makes sense to say things like that guy is a chad theoretically different guys can be a chad in different circumstances its not that he isnt a real person chad is a role than certain men fulfill relative to other men i think that each of us characterize chad a little differently and thats okay ive always thought of chad as that guy who has basically nothing to offer women besides his looks yet he still gets way more women that i could ever dream of like ive spent years cultivating my talents and becoming this interesting wellrounded guy but women still prefer chad because hes hot and confident and if i were a bona fide redpiller i would complain about how females wont realize that im actually a better catch than chad until those women are old and not as pretty anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think a major issue here based off the montage of chad posts we had like a week ago here is that people internalize the idea that chad is meant to be a specific person thats because chad is supposed to be a specific person that guy who has no trouble into getting women to come home with him considering the quality of the women he brings home he might even be more than merely a chad he can be an apex chad indeed there are men like that in the world true they dont hang out with most people but if you know the right guys the right chads you are welcomed into a world that both makes you weep with how beautiful it is and a world that can be the greatest cause of your own deepseated misery when used like this the concept of the chad becomes pointless because it makes a man feel he is always lacking thats how its supposed to be the man should always be feeling hes lacking because hes lacking hes not perfect unless he looks like this unless the man looks like that will always be low smv no matter how many hot girls i slept with no matter how many much younger hot girls check me out daily nothing of that matters at all because i dont have aesthetics i will never be able to go up to a girl i have never met and tell her i want to fuck her against a wall behind the nightclub like i have been deployed for years and now im back for some good pussaaaaaah i dont measure up im not good enough i am not worthy there have been girls who wanted to make me their boyfriend it made me feel so bad like im bad enough to be a boyfriend but not good enough to be an ons its highly offensive g and anytime some machomasculine guy comes around you will think he is a chad and get intimidated lol i dont get intimidated by muscular men muscles alone do not make a man sexually attractive ive met several bodybuilders who couldnt get laid if the secret to a huge donger was in that pussy they wanted so much this is the man im afraid of god damn bro stop intimidating me lol i cant compete with that hes a god among chads and thats the sort of guy i compete for girls i would give half my life span to be able to live the few years id have left as him its not just about the sexxxxinnng a guy like that hes the worlds foremost male model lol he has access to everything that i want access to id become a worldclass actor so fast was i to have his looks i could become a musician and sing pop love songs like enrique iglesias and make it so far and so distant and so well of course i feel intimidated lol i see dudes like him pull girls like theyre being evacuated from the titanic and the dudes dick the only lifeboat left women are not obligated to sleep with you based off your niceness dinners or favors hahaha there are guys who think that to tell you the truth i am always filled with glee when i see girls or i have girls tell me that theyve gone to fancy dinners dates and so forth and got what they wanted without giving to the men what they wanted smart girls give them nothing and take from them everything haha women like men that they think are hot and sexy and sadly all women want the same man the hollywood alist superstar the best model of them all its not even good enough to be a model you need to be the best in the business the most soughtafter the most popular in order for women in your enviroment to see you as attractive and fuckworthy that is i guess just making a guess if a woman rejected you its almost always because she did not find you attractive or confident enough being nicer or friendlier would not have changed her mind if a woman rejects you its because you are not a chad she will say yes to the next chad that comes to her and howls at her mamma are those titties realll charming tt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chad really is psychological concept frankly speaking chad is ideal we all chase no matter how good you are chad will always be better looking richer with better social circle you get the picture so woman these days are not fucking chad we are talking about here they are fucking guys who are closest to ideal of chad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes chad exists hes like one of those kings that lived centuries ago most of the people who lived in his kingdom had never seen the kings face but they knew the king existed and that he owned their asses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he does i know a chad his name is actually chad to hes kind of a manwhore too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah im the one whos gonna fuck youre gfs ass the non chad chad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,did you post on the wrong sub circlejerking is against the rules here unlike tbp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,omegas having gfs getaloadofthisnormiejpg
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chad is just a term for good looking men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theyre not wrong though its a motivator to hedge against a thing that happens in relationships you cannot let yourself go because she does not love you as a person to some degree she loves you as a hot sexy man who brings home the bacon tingles in bed sex is important so if he fails to bring home the bacon ie satisfy a purely economic value for women she will look another way some women will just divorce him straight up other women will just cheat on him chad is a worthwhile reminder to all ye who red pill that theres always a bigger fish especially to we poor sobs who werent born striking gold with the genetic lottery some people did and sometimes no matter how hard you try shes gonna take her better option and it isnt gonna be you thats what trp attempts to steel men against perhaps with hyperbolic fearmongering but what of it its great if things go swimmingly in your relationship fabio but for some of us we cant count on that and for those who couldnt its fucking awful trp is a male approach so get your fucking face in the mud and get those fucking gains or youre a piece of shit who deserves whats coming to him male systematic approach finally this thread seems to have a subtle notion of chad denial to it if you didnt get born with the genetic gold mine and a striking captivating personality its because someone else was i dont care how deeply you want to hamster there exists a small clique of men who can do to women what women regularly do to men these men are chads one of them is my best friend but he is in every sense of the word a chad you are substituting your own comfortable reality for the uncomfortable truth to be denying he exists in my opinion some men just get it theyre chads for the rest of we awkward misled buffoons theres mastercard trp tbp certainly doesnt offer anything useful just unrelenting shame which is unattractive as fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chad is the rp bogeyman used to scare omega incels then explain to me why when i was my ex girlfriend was fucking chads behind my back while telling me she wasnt yet ready to have sex with me i guess she must have been fucked silly by a ghost dick apparently he also had a inch phantom dick the phantom menace pounded her pussy like world war ii fucked the world over lololol lift your weights or chad is gonna fuck your pretty little gf right in the ass and shes gonna love it be a god in every regard or get ready to have your girlfriend taken away from you by chad if shes attractive yes thats how it is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,however i am unsure of how many women actually sleep around or if there are enough chads around to be an issue to most men it is still an issue for most men because the women will still be dreaming about chad not about them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of cours chad is real but if you use chad as an excuse to opt out of the dating sphere its not useful to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure chad is a concept and not an actual person no chad is not a concept its not something you can think of subjectively its a condition like green eyes or brown eyes theyre either green or brown eyes there is something known to the world as a chad and its not the guy who is better than me or the next guy close to me its that ideal the embodiment of male perfection he is heracles and apollo all in one as the dual greek ideological physical perfection come together to create the chad theoretically different guys can be a chad in different circumstances no that cannot be it is out of every mans but the genetic chad to become chad you can be an attractive man in the midst of average looking guys but if the girls match your looks pussy will not be nearly half as easy as it is to get for chad i have seen girls who were decisively good girls lose their panties literally at the sight of a chad it was like watching a ghost get a chick pregnant think that each of us characterize chad a little differently and thats okay ive always thought of chad as that guy who has basically nothing to offer women besides his looks what do you mean the chad has nothing else to offer to women besides his looks what else could women possibly want women make their own money now and can buy their own houses women look at men for entertainement and for pleasure that requires the guy to be funny interesting have a magnetic personality and to have chad looks yet he still gets way more women that i could ever dream of like ive spent years cultivating my talents and becoming this interesting wellrounded guy but women still prefer chad because hes hot and confident haha yes its a waste of time and effort for a man to try and selfimprove because one cant self improve to break mountains with the tips of his fingertips only one god can be called thor and it sure aint be and if i were a bona fide redpiller i would complain about how females wont realize that im actually a better catch than chad until those women are old and not as pretty anymore haha well im good enough to tell women that im a terrible catch
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this cannot be true because multiple terps on here have claimed i am chad simply because im not incel bow before your god
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this thread is a mess some truly unhealthy thoughts in here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just like men like hot sexy girls women like men that they think are hot and sexy women are not obligated to sleep with you based off your niceness dinners or favors woman always have options dont assume your her only option or she has to be with you for whatever reason if a woman rejected you its almost always because she did not find you attractive or confident enough being nicer or friendlier would not have changed her mind shes not yours its only your turn yup sounds about right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chad is jesus if the bible looked at sex as anything other than sinful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there have been girls who wanted to make me their boyfriend it made me feel so bad like im bad enough to be a boyfriend but not good enough to be an ons its highly offensive wait what you were offended that these girls wanted to fuck you more than once
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont get it why would you be afraid of this sean guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yay bring him to ppd so the women can all commence sperm jacking him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bring him to ppd the women can glorify him and put him on a pedestal and the terps can alternately throw rocks and ask for all his chadly secrets
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jokes on you bro if you want to fuck my gf youll have to fuck my hand because i dont have a gf ha ha ha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for the rest of we awkward misled buffoons theres mastercard trp lmaooo mastercard i love you man yeah thats how it is some men who hit genetic lottery have gold sprinkling out of their dicks and nothing they do can put women off whereas dudes who dont have a mastercard are at risk of sneezing and sexually putting off the women hes talking to or something tbp certainly doesnt offer anything useful just unrelenting shame which is unattractive as fuck the bp is absolutely awful its filled with women who think a man only needs to have basic social skills to get laid easily and chads who have never gone a day without having sex and being able to choose the women they want to have sex with because they have numerous and copious amounts of women offering themselves to them its a real tragedy bpers would rather shittalk young red pillers who are trying to make something of themselves in order to attract women but instead they are met with bpers who just want to humiliate them and shame them it goes to show that not only are women deeply disgusted by nonnatural alphas but also the bpers men hate dudes trying to get in their pussyheaven turf
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then explain to me why when i was my ex girlfriend was fucking chads behind my back while telling me she wasnt yet ready to have sex with me because at you were a beta faggot by the sounds of it this doesnt really prove the existence of chads it just proves the existence of betas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think its clear that chad is some kind of general metaphor for the guy who makes you worry that hes going to steal your girl im not sure why so many rp men insist that we all have to agree on the exact details why cant chad be defined more personally hypothetically speaking lets say im a in the looks department and i have a friend whos a and he has a girlfriend whos also a if i spend a lot of time around them and the girlfriend starts showing signs of attraction toward me then im the chad of that particular situation not a but still threatening enough to steal the girlfriend i dont understand whats wrong with that definition of chad its just a metaphor for male insecurity if another male envies me because of my higher smv then im his chad right if im wrong here please explain why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont forget chads are super rare but theyre all apparently best friends with him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol really dudes here told you that you are chad because youve had sex oh boy i wonder how they would react if they ever met a male model jesus christ has returnedddd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah im pretty sure jesus was fucking a lot of girls dude was the prophet of a new religion lelll its not like he didnt have groupies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wait what you were offended that these girls wanted to fuck you more than once why do i want to fuck a girl more than once do you eat the same plate of food more than one time isnt one plate of food enough for the time being its the same way with girls jesus i cant deal with a woman everyday of the week too much effort and investment you know ideally id like to get laid with a different girl once a week i do have a very high sex drive but my lefts hand is as strong as industrial steel by now so its sorta okay that im single
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,indeed even chads with money and fame get dumped all the time its really pointless and silly for a man to develop an emotional bond with a girl because eventually she is going to dump him why bother
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he has enough baby mommas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well if you think omegas have gfs you are clueless normie duh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lool i dont know about that at i was smoking weed and surfing everyday i didnt have a job i didnt have bills to pay i was just enjoying life id say that life was pretty awesome back then that chick tho she was a sassy little thing wasnt even feet tall she had the attitude of a feet tall man and was as filled with nagging as a feet tall man who stubbed his toenails its one of my regrets that i didnt get to fuck her she didnt even gave me a handjob ever lol tt such a beta cuck this doesnt really prove the existence of chads pls turn off the tv and watch chads
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think its clear that chad is some kind of general metaphor for the guy who makes you worry that hes going to steal your girl no bro hes the guy who stole my girl hes the guy who was banging my girlcan i really say she was my girl lol while she was making me wait for sex because she wasnt emotionally ready for it i reckon chads dick has some sort of magical salve to it that makes every girl who sees him become ready for sex hahaha looking back im quite surprised that i wasnt even angry at her it was hilarious despite the fact that i never fucked her nor did she ever sucked me off or anything i enjoyed the time and the lessons i learned from being with her i hope things turned out alright for her in the end im not sure why so many rp men insist that we all have to agree on the exact details why cant chad be defined more personally because beauty is objective what one woman finds to be hot is the same the next girl is going to find to be hot say a girl is into african americans whereas another girl is into irish dudes what makes the irish guy hot hes tall handsome not fat has a full head of hair has a confident personality same goes for the africanamerican the only difference is the skin color lol like how guys will talk about how some girls like alternative men and other girls like skaters and other women like models in the end theyre all chad only chads that belong to their niche ypothetically speaking lets say im a in the looks department and i have a friend whos a and he has a girlfriend whos also a if i spend a lot of time around them and the girlfriend starts showing signs of attraction toward me then im the chad of that particular situation chad is the guy who can attract and fuck women effortselly while i have to put effort into getting those girls to come home with me and it usually takes me weeks mr big dick chaderino goes up to the girl and says heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey and bam the big bang occurs that is chad basically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chad originated from the central african republic of chad a frozen chad is called a chadsickle chads favourite band is jason derulo the only games that chad plays are fifa call of duty and with mladys heart chads favourite film is the scarface trilogy or the hangover part chads greatest fears are maths drag queens subtitled films and commitment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and every woman has slept with a dozen of them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha for real man ppd is so good for my selfesteem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he was always hanging with prostitutes man jesus was living it the fuck up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah imagine the badboy cred jesus must have got with his antiauthority and rebellious attitude there were probably many an israelite girl surreptitiously flicking her bean even while he was being led up to the cross forgive them father for they know not what they do lol these guys must have got laid like rock stars mohammeds infamous sexual exploits are well documented i imagine buddhas world view also turned a swift degrees when some hot brown pussy fell in his lap
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah youd make a shit boyfriend but that doesnt mean being an ons is inherently better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you ever want to offer me a birthady gift offer me one of those really nice sports gloves i need one at this point in time lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chad is the guy who can attract and fuck women effortselly while i have to put effort into getting those girls to come home with me and it usually takes me weeks mr big dick chaderino goes up to the girl and says heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey and bam the big bang occurs that is chad basically im not going to lie it kinda seems like a guy would have to be at least a minor celebrity to do that how many nonfamous men actually pull this off and when you say big dick do you actually mean to say that he has a big dick or are you just saying hes very masculine because i dont know how in the world a woman is supposed to gravitate toward big penises since she doesnt even know a guys penis size until she decides to sleep with him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can you be chad if youre average height
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eh ppd is a good distraction and a place to have some fun some people take this way too seriously tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all those holy wars were about fighting over chad mindblown
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dude i make a shit everything im a shit friend a shit son a shit citizen a shit employeeim white trash haha but i love the dogs i take care of very dearly and i would die for them i guess i still have to work hard at being a really shitty human being but i love animals so much you know anyway how can i dissapoint girls in one night stands and make them swear off casual sex when girls wont approach me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,normieeveryone who isnt an internet loser omega see the guy having a fat gf who treat him like dirt that guy is chad to the omega
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how many nonfamous men actually pull this off depends on what you mean by famous and the context male models are famous but most women dont know the guys a model dont know which brands he works for who wants to hire him who he worked for who is grooming himthe designercompany to be the next big hit and how is as a professional in the modelling world they just see that hes incredibly hot and want him theres nothing more to it and when you say big dick do you actually mean to say that he has a big dick inches dick dude sent her a dick pic once when i was making a call on her phone because i had lost my phone a couple days before lol ive seen enough dicks to know a big dick when i see one because i dont know how in the world a woman is supposed to gravitate toward big penises since she doesnt even know a guys penis size until she decides to sleep with him haha yeah wouldnt you know guys also send nude pics lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tom cruise is one and hes short so why not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,never forget the holy trinichad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,kind of a misleading article title since this is only in the context of reproduction though i dont think incels are kvetching about their inability to get equal access to ivf treatments
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sothe solution is to make more single parents facepalm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is about reproduction not sex the fact that who recognizes inability to find a suitable sex partner as a fertility problem doesnt mean that it agrees this is a broader problem due to lack of sexual activity its clear this is geared towards homosexual couples not incels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,usually when we hear incels we think hetero men but this is more aimed at women both hetero and lesbians you still need a uterus for in vitro fertilization to work maybe im missing something but im not sure how this applies to men so i dont think this signals more concern for mens rights
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incels arent mentioned at all in the article because this isnt about incels in particular but whether or not people who arent in a meaningful relationship or biologically incapable of reproducing between themselves should have the same right to have assistance in making a family as those who are biologically infertile which really is a very good question personally i dont think singles are right for this sort of thing for homosexual couples i think its worth considering because in a sense theyre no less biologically incapable of making children than an infertile heterosexual couple and i dont know that most singles want to have help with making a child for them to take care of themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this was just a change in definition to make fertility treatments more accessible to singles and gay couples not a commentary on mens right in particular personally i think its shit its not the whos place to try to make social policy like this social issues are an entirely different beast than medical issues who should be concerned about medical issues which this is not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you believe being an incel is a disability why or why not ooh my goooosh this is hilarious being an incel is a symptom of a disability in terms of ppd does this signal more of a concern for mens rights itll go for women as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,inceldom is not a disability but inceldom is totally a disability the elephant man had a girlfriend i rest my case
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being incel is not a disability and it insults the people who do have disabilities i believe incels are a menace to society they are ppure evil
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont quite see the solution here so some people cant reproduce and now society is going to make sure they do we should be going in the exact opposite direction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so why should an incel come visit this subreddit or any puaself help circle when he can collect disability checks to enhance his lifestyle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the thing is many antifeminists complain because women are not reproducing and that is why immigrants get imported but they fail to realise the drastic consequences breeding the spawn of subgenetic incels and supposedly letting it be raised by said incels will be the children of alpha widows will seen welladjusted by comparison
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in terms of reproducing yes it is in terms of just about everything else nah also one could equally as well argue that a woman who is unlikely to obtain the reproductive cooperation of a suitable man in time to make children is similarly disabled so well done who on this change that will make wellrun government subsidised sperm banks much more easily available to women in their late thirtiesearly forties no more settling for unattractive men so long as youve got the you can buy some prime sperm and get on with life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i dont think being incel is a disability if someone is not able to entice a partner into reproducing with them they can adopt the world is brimming with parentless children already this new un dealio sound like its mostly intended for single women and gay couples its not like theyre going to force women to have sex with men they dont want to to bear children they dont want to this sounds like if anything it can guarantee a man a path to have a testtube baby but thats not what incels actually want
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no such thing as a fertile woman who cant find a man to inseminate her she may be extremely picky and not like her options but if she just wants a guy to cum in her pussy that would be very easy to find as far as men go the cure for most men in rich industrialized feminist low natality sexprison countries would be a plane ticket to a world country is health insurance going to start paying for that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it means they see it as a disability in the context of being able to have children because it poses an obvious disadvantage to becoming a parent thats not the same as viewing it as a disability on its own
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if the right to reproduce is recognized we open the door to state subsidized eggs and surrogates for male incels denying people of their rights is inhumane
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah now that i think about it this really only benefits women unless they start subsidizing wombs for incels which actually hurts incels even more because those women could probably easily acquire some low value incel semen if they wanted but now they can hold out for their ivf and use some top notch chad donors instead
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i concur what i got from this article was that if you have problems naturally procreating either due to low fertility low compatibility with your partner or homosexuality youre considered disabled in that regard not getting a mate whatsoever for reasons unrelated to this doesnt seem to be the issue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the world only makes sense if you think the people on top actively hate the rest of us
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is about reproduction not sex see my other comment its clear this is geared towards homosexual couples not incels no its not thats your opinion under the new rules heterosexual single men and women and gay men and women who want to have children will now be given the same priority as a couple seeking ivf because of medical fertility problems
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,homosexual couples they can have sex with women even if theyre not attracted to them while incels cant by definition
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,possibly may lead to less men being trapped
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre right this sounds like it is aimed at women who are approaching menopause and havent been able to lock down that handsome charming billionaire professional athlete and medical doctor prince of a small european nation that theyve been looking for they could settle for some unattractive guy on their level who would be willing to date them but they dont want that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incels arent mentioned at all in the article because this isnt about incels in particular but whether or not people who arent in a meaningful relationship or biologically incapable of reproducing between themselves should have the same right to have assistance in making a family as those who are biologically infertile this has nothing to do with meaningful relationships this is directly about incels who else cant find someone to marry or have sex with incels arent mentioned because the term isnt popularized this doesnt at all concern medically disabled people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,social issues are an entirely different beast than medical issues surely this is a good example of when they arent though a lesbian couple a heterosexual woman with no partner and a straight couple who havent been able to conceive all need medical assistance in procreating turkey baster and a male friend with a jam jar not cutting it the issue previously has been that certain nations have dictated that only medical necessity requiring this medical intervention can be defined in terms of reproductive pathology which is itself defined in terms of the ability to perform regular heterosexual sex despite the fact that this medical intervention is to perform a lifestyle function the ability to have biological children as opposed to a life extending or physical comfort function realistically the decision is then between we only consider reproductive issues requiring medical intervention to be with people who have tried a significant amount of heterosexual sex or we dont need the hetero sex part any more with the former the elephant in the room is essentially those who are gaylesbianasexualetc have to either engage in a sexual act they may find physically repellant or we effectively declare that the medical community consider this medical treatment for the hetero partnered community only the problem with reproductive medical field is that it objectively important to the continuation of the human race but also intrinsically social
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,died a virgin
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the opposite direction so make sure they dont reproduce
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one is suggesting that they get disability checks people who are physically infertile right now dont get disability checks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if being an incel is actually accepted as a disability then everyone who makes fun of incels now is an ableist shitlord who needs to check hisher privilege
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also one could equally as well argue that a woman who is unlikely to obtain the reproductive cooperation of a suitable man in time to make children is similarly disabled doesnt exist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wouldnt hiring a prostitute be cheaper
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the cure for a man who cant find a fertile woman to mate with would be to pay for surrogacy or ivf just like it is for an infertile woman whether health insurance covers all or part of that depends upon the state in states in which it is covered in whole or in part i would be fine with it covering a man or a gay couple as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think this is getting that ball rolling and im for it personally still incels and lonely men dont want test tube babies they want sex and adult companionship this gets them neither
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are not state subsidized eggs and surrogates for fertilityimpaired men and women and the right to procreate exists regardless its a fundamental right which cannot be taken away without a strict scrutiny analysis thats not the same as saying it must be provided in the first place under your fundamental rights analysis mail order brides must be provided to the marriageimpaired just because the right to marry is fundamental
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have a right not to be denied reproduction as in no one can sterilize you or prevent you from having sex against your will however if no one says yes to reproducing with you thats not your right being taken away
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see in the article that the procedure is subsidized can you clarify im all for reproductive freedom but not statesubsidized reproduction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if we open the door to mandatory egg harvesting we also open the door to sperm harvests and mandatory child support in essence a daddy tax choose carefully
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so making more incel men by allowing them to get surrogate mothers is the thing to do keeping hte misery going
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly im guessing the primary targets are gay couples
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have no doubt this is declaration was meant to mostly benefit women since it costs less to address their right to reproduce than it does men but why should efficiency matter in the face of our ideals for equality and fairness some ideologues actually think fairness and equality should be put above everything else
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they can already do this by going to a sperm bank
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no its not thats your opinion if you think this is designed to benefit incels as much as gay couples i dont know what world youre living in there is no way this about whether sex or lack of sex is a disability the right to procreate a right to sex much less recreational sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure but thats besides the point this isnt a policy designed to help alleviate a lack of sex problem its a policy designed to help with a lack of fertility problem if that verbose way of saying things makes sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not that youre bitter though right 😂
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the problem is that they are not allowed to fertilize more than women with muh sperm i would totally give my sperm for all them ugly peoplez but the state says no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when i say those who are biologically incapable i mean homosexual couples which were mentioned in the article directly they are for all intents and purposes the same as an infertile couple in so much as between themselves they are effectively infertile you are right about the term incel but the article is specific about it being both those who cannot find and those who simply do not have a sexual relationship which would broaden the scope to all single people who might wish children without a partner so its not about incels in particular but they are included in the sweep which is why i say it isnt about them anymore than its about everyone else in particular than single people and nonmedically infertile couples as a whole which would pretty much open this up to everyone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,surely this is a good example of when they arent though of course they are related we are social creatures and we love to form opinions on anything and everything medical issues can feed into social issues however that doesnt mean that they are that heavily intertwined we can view infertility from a strictly medical perspective with no regard to social issues the who is an agency dedicated to evaluating medical issues it gets its stances from medical experts with minimal input from the general public we dont elect who officials and experts this is because it is suppose to be an agency that looks at medical issues not social issues or the social side of medical issues my issue with this is entirely about who overstepping its boundaries when it comes to social issues the public should be involved and make the decisions not an oligarchy which a panel of nonelected officialsexperts would be you might agree with the whos views this time but what if they decided that homosexuality was a mental illness and gays should be institutionalized do you really want a group of unelected officials to make such choices im not saying that the issue itself is so clear cut maybe we should have this technology more easily accessible to everyone i lean against that stance but it is a different question i dont think the who should make that decision if certain nations have decided that the failure of hetrosexual intercourse is required to define a person as infertile then that is what the nation has decided if you dont like that petition for the nation to make such changes make such changes through a good democratic fashion that involves the people dont try to force it through an oligarchy that said im not sure how accessible fertility treatments should be if you have money you can get them to get pay out of pocket in your own country or do it in another country generally these types of questions are if we should have these procedures covered by insurance asking if they should be accessible to gay couples makes it seem like its a matter of gay rights the real question is if we should have the rest of society flip the bill for it which is a trickier question im all for gay rights but im not sure if id classify fertility treatments for anyone to be something we should ensure everyone has access to is having biological children that much of a need im not sold on it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,still had a girlfriend if the elephant man can get a girlfriend an incel can most certainly get laid theres also a thing called cough cough prostitutes cough cough but apparently incels dont think they count it doesnt matter though getting laid is getting laid so therefore inceldom cant be considered a disability
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah if someone cant find a partner thats natural selection at work let it do its job
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they dont get state subsidized infertility treatment either unless the state mandates it this announcement has nothing to do with sex and ops attempt to stretch a right to reproduction to sex is interesting but ultimately incorrect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe they will be considered minorities by bpers and feminists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i said reproductive cooperation that means obtaining of genetic material with his full consent for it being used to make babies and suitable as in someone a reasonable woman would be willing to accept as either a coparent in a parenting based relationship or as a coparent and sexual partner amazingly enough reasonable men who have something positive rather than just burdens and trouble to offer as fathers generally are in no more of a hurry to have babies with women who are down the low end of the reproductive value range than reasonable women who have something positive to offer as mothers are in a hurry to have sex and make babies with incels funny bout that i see great positives for womens choices in this change yet another safety net giving women options so that they dont gotta bother with guys unless they really want to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,were talking reproduction here not getting laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not me ill take a test tube baby dont have to risk losing custody or paying child support
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no the right to reproduce just covers stuff like forced sterilization let natural selection do its job and give the losers a social niche the stigma sucks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you would be in favour of state subsidized prostitution for incels instead why not lets just subsidize everything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then tell them to go to a prostitute and have sex men who are in relationships are paying for it with goodlooks charm or a big dick nothing is free for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre coming at this from a law pov but im concerned about policy a right to food and shelter doesnt just protect you from having your food and shelter taken away by the govt it drives people to provide it to those who dont have it people take these fundamental rights seriously enough to provide them to people living in other countries who lack them so once enough people become aware and take seriously this fundamental right to procreate wont they be compelled to provide how can you recognize someones fundamental right to procreate while at the same time telling them well sucks that you were born underprivileged good luck trying to procreate thats inhumane and unempathetic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is nobody in this country who got kids on his or her own nobody you built an egg in your ovaries or some sperm in your testicles good for you but i want to be clear you fed your body food the rest of us worked for your fertility is maintained by health care the rest of us pay for and educate you are safe in your homes and hospitals because of police forces fire fighters and emts that the rest of us paid for you didnt have to worry about marauding rapists impregnating you now look you made some egg or sperm and and thats a great biological accomplishment god bless keep most of it for yourself almost all of it but part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next incel who comes along
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is true i just dont really trust people like feminists to understand what equality means their current track record is shitty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but now they get it accelerated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is no way this about whether sex or lack of sex is a disability whats the title of the article a person who is unable to find a suitable sexual partner or is lacking a sexual relationship the right to procreate a right to sex much less recreational sex nobody is saying people have a right to sex this is a red herring i am saying the article is recognizing men who cannot find a wife and want to have children incels that want to have kids your basing your argument about your perceptions of the article not whats in it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok but then we as a society shouldnt move in the opposite direction we should just leave the situation be and not interfere at all also if its natural selection at work wouldnt that mean incels are genetically predisposed to be incels because otherwise the human gene pool wouldnt really benefit from this kind of natural selection no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know who else advocated eugenics hitler
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,several countries mainly in europe do reimburse people for ivf treatment but just for women who cant conceive naturally httpwwwivfworldwidecomeducationintroductionivfcostsworldwidepolicyofreimbursementhtml my understanding is that this change would probably lead to ivf reimbursements for women who cant conceive because they dont have a partner at least in those countries where physically infertile couples are reimbursed i agree that the op stretches things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this announcement has nothing to do with sex and ops attempt to stretch a right to reproduction to sex is interesting but ultimately incorrect read the article please but now in dramatic move the world health organisation will change the standard to suggest that a person who is unable to find a suitable sexual partner or is lacking a sexual relationship to have children the focus is on the lack of sexual activity your being ignorant by stating your opinion as the truth when it isnt represented in the article
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the problem is determining where they fit on the progressive stack are they more oppressed and bullied than women ethnics lgbt muslims
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah and then the women will support incels then go back to fucking chuck norris while the incels write about putting women into farms
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that means obtaining of genetic material with his full consent for it being used to make babies first of all you dont have a clue of how ivf or sperm banking works a man doesnt choose which woman receives his sperm a woman chooses after he donates the sperm i see great positives for womens choices in this change yet another safety net giving women options so that they dont gotta bother with guys unless they really want to why are you not equally concerned for gay men can we agree tbp is gynocentric now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would you procreate with a third world stranger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh fair point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if its all your kid you will be solely responsible for supporting it you realize
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,children that are brought up by two parents are more happy and successful you need both a male and female role model for the child
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no kid wants a gross incel dad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they have to be forced into that niche they arent losers if they have options they can always form rape gangs with their fellow incels it is a tried and true method and is proven daily in germany and the uk
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,legalization yes subsidies no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,already subsidizing single moms why not men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is what amsterdam does and the resulting tourism brings in a load of cash same as the british royal family really
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,by that logic nothing is free for women either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a right to food and shelter doesnt just protect you from having your food and shelter taken away by the govt it drives people to provide it to those who dont have it my understanding is that there is no fundamental right to food and shelter there are programs in place which provide help in this regard but its not because the law or policy recognizes these are fundamental rights the only rights you have wrt to these things are that if the government provides them to you they cannot take them away without due process there is no right to have them in the first place the programs are in place because they recognize a need not a fundamental right although its possible im misremembering so once enough people become aware and take seriously this fundamental right to procreate wont they be compelled to provide no they wont just like no one is compelled to provide you a spouse despite the fact that the right to marry is a fundamental right just like no one is compelling doctors to prescribe you birth control despite there being a fundamental right to use contraception just like no one is required to provide you transportation despite there being a fundamental right to travel on some level there may be some efforts made to ease affordability but beyond that i dont see fundamental rights being compelled the way youre suggesting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im basing my argument in reality which doesnt include anyone caring that much about incels characterized by their lack of recreational or non recreational sex in particular
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we should just leave the situation be and not interfere at all agreed also if its natural selection at work wouldnt that mean incels are genetically predisposed to be incels yep theyre born with severe mental illness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it aint eugenics to just let people who cant have sex the process required to naturally procreate not have kids lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so just so were clear if we as a society dont make it a priority so that every single human is given reproductive opportunity we are practicing eugenics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eugenics is becoming more and more important with all sperm donnor and single women who want to have children
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah i am talking about the us sorry
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the focus is clearly on reproduction not lack of sex this has nothing to do with elevating incels youre stretching that it has to do with allowing people who are reproductively challenged through choice ie gay couples or heterosexual singles to be on the same level as fertilitymedicallyhampered people when it comes to getting benefits its clearly more about benefiting gays than incels having children isnt a priority to incels are you kidding me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theyre still straight men so probably pretty low on the oppression scale
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,autistics are in the stack and they seem wellrepresented over there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,clearly the only fair thing to do is to make some women farms
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why are you not equally concerned for gay men gay men are competent to be concerned for themselves i come to their assistance on matters of public policy if and when i see them as a group publicly request allies ive never really known them to get upset about me having concern for the wellbeing and choices of other women that particular flavour of butthurt seems to be mostly a het male thing specifically an unattractive hetmale thing it is pathetic when het men attempt to speak for gay men in order to attempt to manipulate heterosexual women sad pathetic unfuckable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not a problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,picking up women is easy tho im well off have a very close family and could easily get a single mom hell i took a toddler to chuck e cheese once and had all kinds smiling at me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no we dont plenty of great people are the result of single parents no one needs a woman to raise a kid with women are just necessary to make a baby
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its indeed well proven that single mothers cant raise kids properly but its not proven to be the case for single father households mainly because theyre rare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is true families are shrinking and children are paying the price
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,awww sounds like a teenage girl is throwing around some shaming language thats cute
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape is fucking wrong can get you beaten or killed and doesnt give you intimacy or companionship
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure it is all a woman gotta do is not be fat aka dont eat like a hippo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my understanding is that there is no fundamental right to food and shelter fundamental rights have a more specific legalistic meaning in the us for most people around the world human rights and fundamental rights are interchangeable httpsenwikipediaorgwikifundamentalrightslegalmeaningintheunitedstates but in an international context the right to water has been recognized in a wide range of international documents including treaties declarations and other standards for instance the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women cedaw requires state parties to ensure to women the right to enjoy adequate living conditions particularly in relation to water supply the convention on the rights of the child crc requires states parties to combat disease and malnutrition through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinkingwater on some level there may be some efforts made to ease affordability but beyond that i dont see fundamental rights being compelled the way youre suggesting thats how things are now because people still dont have the perception that society is actively denying them these rights the govt doesnt actively deny people access to water but if a corporation or the govt accidentallyindirectly tainted the ogallala aquifer people would rightfully demand that the govt provide access to clean water no one is compelled to find brides for incels but if the cost of marriage becomes prohibitive enough and there is a widespread perception that the govt is to blame or society somehow they couldwould complain about needing subsidies additional tax benefits or other forms of relief
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except men dont have reproductive rights once a woman gets pregnant by them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am not sure i agree with you on that some may be born with mental illness for others i believe it has more to do with socialization a lack of experience during their teens and now its even harder for them to gain that experience with women since most women are not looking for an inexperienced socially inept guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you have any stats as to just how many single women are opting for sperm donors
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it has to do with allowing people who are reproductively challenged through choice ie gay couples or heterosexual singles choice isnt mentioned in the article it states a person who is unable to find a suitable sexual partner or is lacking a sexual relationship to have children nothing about choice here it uses the word unable being single by choice doesnt mean unable its clearly more about benefiting gays than incels having children isnt a priority to incels are you kidding me if it was more about gays it would be more labeled with lgbtq rhetoric and a victory as love wins or other sjw slogans in other articles covering this its not apparent as a main motivation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,redditors in general need to be added to the stack
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you joke but
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is pathetic when het men attempt to speak for gay men in order to attempt to manipulate heterosexual women sad pathetic unfuckable its pathetic when someone is so trapped in an echochamber they cant see their bias and misandry from a hole in the ground more people exist than just women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,children that come from motherless homes have difficulties developing bonds with other adults besides the father there is an increased level of fear and anxiety that is present with children from motherless homes because they are scared that other adults will also leave there is a twofold grieving process for children in motherless homes because the lost relationship is missed and then any hope of a reunion with the mother is then abandoned as well children who come from motherless homes have a higher risk of isolation because they are uncomfortable around other children who speak about their mothers there is an increased risk of future abuse and abandonment occurring at the hands of children who come from motherless homes homes can be motherless even when a mother is still present in the home because there can be psychological issues with the mother at play that cause the same effects of abandonment as actual abandonment does fathers and mothers are both important
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im just being honest they should stick to embarassing themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre moving the goalposts now because until now no one talked about intimacy and companionship only reproduction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a viable reproductive strategy also stockholm syndrome will be enough for intimacy and companionship and it is only temporarily wrong as history demonstrates values are flexible and i doubt it will get you beaten or killed in a western country
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres more to that see how the red pill always talks about being the perfect submissive wife being a sahm but still not taking alimony always in the mood tolerates all her husbands flaws without having much flaws herself but even not being fat and not eating a lot is a sacrifice talk to someone a diet its very painful to look at that cake and say nope im on a diet people were born with a natural desire to eat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly i think its likely a combo of both theyre born with some kind of mental illness that makes it hard for them to socialise like a normal person for whatever reason whether its autism or social anxiety or something more serious like schizophrenia at the same time their illness is not correctly treated if indeed its even treated at all and id be willing to put my life on most of them having shitty parents too whether theyre simply neglectful or absent or downright narcissistic and abusive its myriad factors contributing to a huge heap of crazy when it comes to the incel camp i do think if youre crazy but learn to leverage it to your advantage you can ultimately do fine in the social world including dating i sure have and the list of diagnoses handed to me by various psychiatrists is as long as santas naughty list but i was brought up well and as far as the discussion about eugenics goes im opting to take my genes out the pool even tho i can get laid because its really not good to be like me and id be an awful parent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when i read your comments i realize i probably expressed myself poorly my point is in my country at least only single women can get sperm donors they could be lesbians but its forbiden to be declared as it for now and procreate as it in our consumption society they select the donor with special characteristics which is for me eugenics so there is more and more eugenics state of mind among our society i didnt want to claim that eugenics take a significant weight among births at least so far
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is about gay couples and those wanting to be single parents not involuntary celibates who i highly doubt are even on the whos radar read the article with a little bit of common sense find me where inceldom is somehow primarily related to the inability to procreate until then youve just stretched this to fit your narrative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ooh what should my oppression olympic event be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha your flair
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,god its such a great idea
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,more people exist than just women pffft the only time you care about gay men is when you suspect a het woman might care more about what they think than about what you think
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that article seems to imply that a lot of the disadvantages stem from the sudden death or absence of a parent which obvously would traumatize a child also id like to see their sources for those statistics this reads like some mighty assumptions that were drawn from data bereft of context i looked at the article and all they had was a list and a youtube video
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no your just being rude
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok no one has the right to reproduce in the sense that the government should provide them with a partner the right to reproduce means that the government shouldnt interfere with consenting competent adults reproductive choices
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think a lot if mental illness comes from upbringing even if youre genetically predisposed to some mental illness environmental factors help determine if you will actually have issues an interesting article i read was about schizophrenic people in nonwestern countries and how their hallucinations were completely benignfriendly edit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agree on most of that not sure if you actually need to have any kind of mental illness to be incel although for many its surely a contributing facor i think if you are brought up in a bad way though perhaps live a rather secluded life during your teenage years it doesnt take any bad genes to end up in that situation but i dont know for sure of course not a psychologist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this who announcement is targeted towards women not men frankly it doesnt matter how screwed up a woman is or even if shes ugly some man will always be willing to creampie her there are shitloads of women with all kinds of socalled mental disorders who get fucked regularly or at least used to get fucked when they were younger and had a potential to get pregnant women tend to love going to shrinks and taking medicines for disorders and youll probably find more women running to shrinks and popping pills than men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no im interested in the eugenics argument im just legitimately wondering how many are actually opting for this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i havent thought about it enough i shut my brain off while commenting for this post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,still got that lurkin
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honesty can be rude yes if my dad was a fat ugly dude who didnt get laid i would feel shame you wouldnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that the government should provide them with a partner no argument from me also if you look at population pyramids youll see that all age ranges below have more men than women in most countries so thatd be technically impossible to accomplish the right to reproduce means that the government shouldnt forcibly sterilize people based on any criteria imo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre not wrong personality disorders in particular are primarily influenced by environment i just get the feeling from reading incel rants that these are people whod have been fucked no matter what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,everything i just said applies to women as well as men i know many here love to throw around this meme that women can do literally anything and still get laid but that isnt reality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think it highly depends on the country in france its around of art for heterosexual couples i dont know how many get sperm donor and i dont know how many single women go outside of our border to do it what i know is we lack sperm donors and there was a media campaign to support it this is in part due to the fact that france try to get rid of the donnors anonymity i checked again to be sure about what i said and apparently the law for single women didnt pass here only heterosexual couples can get a sperm donor the single women i hear about go to belgium or spain to get the sperm sorry for my mistake
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,braindead welcome to the stack
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there you go again making stuff up in your head not only do i get laid but im most likely way out of your league
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed for the mentally retarded in institutions just keep the men separated from the women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a book ive been reading makes me feel like mental illness is a lot more beatable than we tend to think its mostly based around the idea that the mind is rewireable idk too much about autism but i have heard of cases where even they can manage to live normal lives with some help my point is i dont want to be too quick to call anyone a hopeless cause
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol i just mean in general i dont knowcare who you are
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because hostility speaks volumes theyre not just having standards theyre assigning values and dripping anger over it classic hallmarks of insecurity guys who arent insecure about it are upfront about eg i want someone whose values are compatible with mine it seems no one really bothers calling women insecure that much you really should have seen my pms a couple weeks ago so much name calling coupled with accusations of my own insecurity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women are insecure about being called sluts or being valued less for being slutty this is why they keep telling everyone you shouldnt slutshame men are insecure about not being good enough in bed or having as big a dick as all the other guys shes been with before or just that she might cheat on him so they say sluts are bad and women shouldnt be sluts both sides are trying to influence the other to conform to their own ideal reality so with slutty women it will be to influence men to view sluts as equally valuable as chaste women and for insecure men it will be to convince women to remain chaste im afraid to say red pill men that the sluts are winning this by a long way at least in the west so you can either accept it and deal with your own insecurities opt out of the smp or join a religion like islam or a culture that polices womens sexuality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is considered to be a knockout punch retort to the very real statistical evidence that men are better off avoiding promiscuous women for relationships higher rates of divorce cheating etc is it i think the biggest thing is men are very hesitant to admit to insecurity as it implies weakness women are usually open about their insecurities and even tend to own them understanding they are part of who they are honestly maybe he is insecure because all the rationalizations people use to disqualify women who have had previous sexual partners never actual consider you know getting to know the woman and see if she embodies those things or not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,insecurity is unattractive in men men are stereotypically overconfident that is masculine insecurity is par for the course for women its even stereotypically feminine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,call it the hail mary pass in reality there is no possible upside to an ltr with a high n count woman however as yes minister once showed when you cant play ball you play the man that is the source of the tactic smart men ignore the jibe grin and move on everyone knows what is going on and barring a dumb man or a bp man like i was once no one is going to get into an ltr with damaged goods
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,calling a man insecure is just a shaming tactic men have notoriously fragile egos and its a notsosubtle attempt to poke it with a stick just about all shaming tactics used against men are variations on youre not man enough to hit them where it hurts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its very common to use personal attacks to discredit the person making the argument and thus appear to discredit the argument indirectly the people making these arguments tend to be people so set in their thinking that the only way they can perceive someone else thinking differently is not through their own logic and rational examination but through some personal defect that poisons their mind to ideas they consider lesser then instead of debating the original idea the discussion just degrades into you trying to combat this accusation of personal defect eg insecurity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because us bluepillers are the ultimate solipsistic hate machines insecure men are weak trp men are weak mras are weak insecure alphas running around losing their frame to bpers makes me laugh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,womens insecurities are shown as yet another way of them being victims society is wrong for making women insecure and needs to change mens insecurity is yet another reason for why they are evil men need to change because they are insecure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont consider saying someone is insecure is a knockout punch but its kinda clear you do im insecure about a lot of things in my life theres nothing wrong with being insecure i think the problem is that most men are not taught how to properly deal with their insecurities they are told that their insecurities make them weak and unattractive so being told they are insecure about anything is an insult to them on the other hand women are taught to deal with insecurities a lot better than men so when they are told they are insecure they have no problem owning up to it and admitting it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,insecurities loom large here bloopers think trpers are insecure and personally i think bloopers are insecure and that is it comforting to think the thoughts that they do largely fanciful about trpers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont note how insecure terpers are about their masculinity to belittle them i do it to possibly liberate them from it by showing just how much they worry about such a thing and how they dont need to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theyre not just having standards theyre assigning values and dripping anger over it ok so still didnt answer my op classic hallmarks of insecurity are men not allowed to be insecure i mean i know that the answer to this is no they are not in society currently but it seems to me that its hypocritical to call men insecure sometimes insecurity is warranted as i feel it is with slutty women in a disparaging way when the bp group overall tend to be feminist criticizing toxic masculinity it seems to me if they were really serious about that they would be totally fine with men being insecure and not wanting to wife up sluts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if anyone is angry its the sluts theyre the ones insecure about their past and just to remind everyone again women are the primary slut shamers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah actually i ran into this in real life today a guy i work with was chatting to me about how he just felt let down he met a nice christian girl who he thought was super compatible with him and he now finds out she has had loads of casual sex i wouldnt call him insecure though he just wants to find someone who thinks about sex the way he does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or join a religion like islam or a culture that polices womens sexuality you jest but groups like isis are gathering supporters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the different sexes have always had different roles and responsibilities in society i would liken slut shaming for women to coward shaming for men the current campaign against stopping slut shaming would be similar to men trying to absolve themselves of the millennia old responsibility of being protectors giving themselves the right to sprint away and leave the girl behind when a mugger jumps out at night or refuse the call to join a justified war without receiving negative social consequences for those actions i think the ageold root of slut shaming at least from the male perspective there is all that business about female slut shaming for various reasons is that when a woman reproduces she is sure that she is the mother when a man reproduces he is not and never has been throughout history sure he is the father at the end of the day were a collection of genes and our collection of genes just wants to pass itself on every man has an instinctive fear of being cuckolded investing time and resources into raising children that arent his and therefore not reproducing while the woman hes with has successfully reproduced a slut stokes that fear a chaste woman calms it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men want women to be insecure so they can control them confidence is considered masculine hence unattractive in women to discourage their natural confidence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is the real reason but im interested in the sjw bp reasoning
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,didnt answer the op
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because us bluepillers are the ultimate solipsistic hate machines insecure men are weak trp men are weak mras are weak insecure alphas running around losing their frame to bpers makes me laugh see see proof right here now time for me to start a thread on trp based on cynical post and accusing the entire blue pill sub for having the exact same perspective so that i can be justified in my insecurities
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the worries they have about wifing up a whore are all very warranted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,still didnt answer my op yes i did its the next sentence the one you quoted just below this those are classic hallmarks of insecurity are men not allowed to be insecure of course they are most people would much prefer that they own their insecurity something women seem to do a bit better than men which is why accusing women of insecurity really isnt a big deal over becoming aggressive however toxic masculinity just fyi toxic masculinity as an actual concept is the idea that men should never be insecure they should always be strong its masculinity working against men via gender roles it has nothing to do with masculinitys effect on women outside of women being concerned about it on behalf of the men in their lives like anything else tumblr has ruined the concept though it seems to me if they were really serious about that they would be totally fine with men being insecure and not wanting to wife up sluts everybody is fine with everybody else having their own personal standards people arent fine with insecure people manifesting their insecurities through name calling and hostility
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being insecure isnt something that should be good or bad it just is being unaware of your insecurity however is bad because you are not living life with full selfawareness i find nothing wrong with an insecure man as long as hes able to own it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women are the primary slut shamers source
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women are the primary slut shamers so start a thread about that i didnt start this op im just replying to it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women are the primary slut shamers really are there more female subreddits complaining about female sluts than male subreddits
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but when they slut shame they shame them for slutty behaviour cheating sleeping with a married guy etc and not for their high ncount they dont shame the same way guys do because for slutshaming men every high ncount woman is a slut but for women slut has little to do with ncount
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol if shes had a lot of casual sex shes not a nice christian girl she might be nice but shes not a christian
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but the part about sluts winning is exactly right theyre having their cake and eating it too and making us pay for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i heard its because allah is hoarding all the virgins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fun fact im a huge slut but you would never know it by looking at me no tattoos highly educated upper middle class straight a student in undergrad etc dont judge a book by its cover
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if a guy doesnt want to be with a slut he doesnt have to still is it not worth being a little introspective to see if theres any chance the reason could be due to an insecurity of some kind esp when guys claim women will compare him to previous partners and wont think hes as good as them the guy should really be asking himself why would he not be as good as them doesnt he have something to offer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fun fact i have a super nerdy forearm tattoo totally not a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there arent really any sjws here so you probably wont get that viewpoint
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just fyi toxic masculinity as an actual concept is the idea that men should never be insecure they should always be strong its masculinity working against men via gender roles i belive this was ops point blue pillers who call men who dont want women with a high partner count insecure virgins or something along these lines are thus reinforcing toxic masculinity so are women who want their man to be a stoic rock without any signs of insecurity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes really look it up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the women in the study were told the subject had an n count of or the women were not told of the behavior of the subject but when they slut shame they shame them for slutty behaviour cheating sleeping with a married guy etc and not for their high ncount so youre just plain wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your source is a magazine article it references the study that found promiscuous women are viewed negatively by women even by women who were more promiscuous than the woman in question the article goes on to say men got off the hook for thier shaming but admits the study didnt even look at mens attitude toward promiscuous women the article itself puts forth this opinion so do you even disagree with me all you did was post an article which largely acknowledges what said women are the primary slut shamers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,couldve been before she converted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think that was kinda his problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you cant beat em join em httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvetvfhnzmcoy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill do all i can to minimize my costs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im mostly the opposite but id probably still be considered a super slutfreak or some sort of slacker just for having so many tattoos people are nuts with their judgments haha ps world tattoos are expensive and pretty mainstream now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im the opposite not slutty in the least but people tend to think i am because of my personality and how i dress
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id probably be able to tell by your attitude and im sure youd drop some slut history info eventually
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would he not be as good as them doesnt he have something to offer depending on the situation it may be that he feels he has to offer too much for something other men got for free
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,any chance the reason could be due to an insecurity of some kind isnt the insecurity warranted in most cases with slutty women though thats what the statistics pretty much prove when guys claim women will compare him to previous partners and wont think hes as good as them i think i saw a study that said something like the majority of women have had the best sex with a previous partner so again id say that the insecurity is warranted most of the time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most men dont have anything to offer that women actually want only the top percentile of men do add in the fact that women have finding sexrelationships easier in general than most men you you have your answer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,heres the reason guys dont like being compared to previous partners and thus why they tend to avoid women with high n count for ltrs first its easier for women to get casual sex thus a woman who has done so will probably have done it with men with smv greater than the man who is willing to commit shes been primed to respond sexually to men with higher value than him this will lead to dissatisfaction on her part and no end of trouble second even if she avoids obvious chads its still a problem lets say a woman has had previous partners guy number starts a long term relationship with her inevitably she will begin to compare him to the other guys but probably those guys had different strengths guy number was a gym rat super ripped so current dude loses on fitness guy was a stand up comedian so current dude loses on humor guy was banker so current dude loses on income and so on and the worst part is current dude will be compared to all those past guys simultaneously if a woman has too many past guys current guy will probably lose on almost every category women are wired fine for serial monogamy be with the current guy until his weaknesses are exposed men are not totally wired for monogamy either but men add women to a harem not replace them lifetime monogamy is less of a psychological jump for men especially in the current culture where women are not encouraged to be introspective about the cause of their dissatisfaction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some guys are great but they have an average or smaller than average penis which cant be overcome by anything and no matter what women claim ive never had a friend that was happy to find a penis smaller than his ex while the opposite within normal size was always a good thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plenty of sjws in the blue pill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no calling men who are insecure about it insecure is not reinforcing toxic masculinity as i said previously and many bpers agreed with there are plenty of men who want a low n count girl for any number of reasons and insecurity isnt one of those calling out individual traits in individuals is completely different from assigning that trait to a group of people who may or may not have it or since i havent had much coffee yet so that sentence is probably confusing as all hell man who is insecure about his partners n count all men who want a low n count partner are insecure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really id count trp mrp and mgtow as part reddits slut hating talks subs males outnumber the female subs not sure what youre counting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but you havent even posted your source in contrast
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being a man slut is difficult to attain unless one is chad level hot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ps world tattoos are expensive and pretty mainstream now good ink is an art form bad ink is what gives tattoos a very bad rep and ive seen a lot of bad ink
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha like what my slut history made me amazing at blowjobs no one ive been with has ever had a problem with it including ltrs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my stance is the other guys didnt get it for free they got sex and no commitment if the guys goal is a ltr they are paying for different things the other guys got a free sample but they dont get to keep the cow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats what the statistics pretty much prove you see what you want to see the statistics and studies are varied some which show that too few previous experiences is actually a bigger risk than a person who has had a handful less than but everyones really a risk and different factors are always coming into play its definitely worth looking deeper than the surface i think i saw a study that said something like the majority of women have had the best sex with a previous partner so again id say that the insecurity is warranted most of the time shrug having best sex is largely irrelevant to me give me good sex frequently and other awesome things and i wont think about best sex guy or compare you to him sex is an experience you get to relive every time you have it as long as the sex in the current relationship isnt downright boring or bad and is good it doesnt have to be best this is why the insecurity is not warranted men do not need to be best they just need to be good enough to keep her interested and attracted and sexually satisfied id feel awful if my bf ever thought i saw him as lesser than my previous partners he is better than them luckily he is not insecure about that or my past hes pretty confident that hes the best for me right now even when i address issues with our sex life together sometimes ill see a tinge of insecurity is it not good enough well sex isnt gonna be amazing every time especially if youre doing it multiple times a week for years and years but we can work together to make sure its not a chore and it is an amazing experience ive never had an amazing experience with casual partners because after the sex is over theres nothing there between us no emotion no love its actually horrible soul crushing even sex outside of a relationship is no longer something id want to do now that ive had it in a relationshipbut thats me personally other women will vary which is why its not an entirely bad idea to get to know her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know why you are so negative on men lots of men have stuff to offer and if they dont what do they expect honestly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hmm im not the average women but my man beats the other men women would benefit from learning how to be introspective and also not judging their man against other men but looking at the whole package if one guy gets a on his body but a for ever else it averages out to like a overall your current partner on the other hand has a straight across the board even if a past partner has a in the category overall the score is lower i prefer the well rounded man who is great in many areas than a man who is amazing in one area and meh in all the others i feel like this is just the sensible approach and a woman who gets it can make it work and just let the amazing experiences be a part of the past and focus on the amazing experiences in the present and never pine for what was but only focus on what the two people can build and improve on together
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah that kinda sucks but a guy could get really good at foreplay and fingering and oral and a woman would be satisfied with that as long as the sizes of the gentitals are compatible it doesnt matter if someone was bigger bigger also isnt always better because some women find too big to be uncomfortable also the past is a memory whereas the present is an experience i cant relive past sex even if i tried ive forgotten basically what those were like i just remember my reaction that was good that wasnt etc i judge my current sex life off the same metrics how good it feels in the now not how it feels compared to the past
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this isnt tbp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,counting subs is ridiculous im talking about the concept look it up female vs male view of female promiscuity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the other guys got a free sample but they dont get to keep the cow lol well ok but you realize that when you buy the cow you now have to pay to feed it house it and take care of it he still got the milk but didnt incur a single cost for the cows upkeep i dont think you understand that even for me a man that wants a ltrmarriage i fully acknowledge that it costs me far more than id prefer to pay if i had a choice and this is exactly why i would not suggest marriage as a good choice for a young man today even though i want it myself if i was id currently find the cost to be far too high the only reason im still in the marriage market is my age bracket and the fact that at this stage in my life ive already made it past the most dangerous phase of marriage the first one from here on no woman will have the same power over me as my first wife because im not having more children if things go south my costs will be minimal no alimony no child support and she can keep the house if she wants it from where im sitting my risks getting married are much lower than theyd be if i was just starting to build a family i have much less to lose and as such the risks involved are minimal my suggestion to young guys dont get married until you are past dont get married unless you want children and only marry when you are ready to start popping them out do all you can to invest money well before you marry and ensure those assets can not be included in marital property so that ifwhen the divorce happens she doesnt get half of it consider it a phase of life instead of a lifelong commitment and chances are youll manage to get most of what you want from it i wish i could say differently but in my mind thats the best case scenario for a guy today worst case he gets married and taken to the cleaners
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you see what you want to see the statistics and studies are varied some which show that too few previous experiences is actually a bigger risk than a person who has had a handful less than but everyones really a risk and different factors are always coming into play its definitely worth looking deeper than the surface nah they are pretty clear a huge correlation exists between promiscuity and divorce for women s long as the sex in the current relationship isnt downright boring or bad and is good it doesnt have to be best this is why the insecurity is not warranted men do not need to be best this is all bullshit and then a declaration of how men should feel coming from a woman who knows nothing of what it is to be a man with the pressure to perform sexually
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men used to have lots to offer not so much anymore at least not enough to cause young attractive women to find the majority of men attractive anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not talking too big just good enough and some guys are lacking in that compartment a guy can be great but it would be even better if his genitals were average sized and knowing that someone mightve been as good as you and better placed is something which cant be easily overcome
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,counting subs is ridiculous agreed not doing you were the one who claimed women are the primary slut shamers primary implies more than simple majority also this is ppd rp has a lot of harsh posts about slut behavior to overlook
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no racebaiting you have been warned time and time again one more comment against the rules and you will be banned for seven days
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is a coal burner
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women can financially support and feed themselves buying the cow in this case means you get the milk whenever you want ie sex whenever you want rather than a one time thing with one person what are the costs of marriage if the woman is good and wont cheatdivorce you what if you found a way to minimize all those risks what if the woman lets you do your thing doesnt nag or demand gives sex freely and willingly seems to me a lot of the reasons marriage is bad is when its with the wrong person not that marriage itself is bad but that women are not properly prepared for marriage and end up sucking but now theres a school of thought for women that we should be introspective self aware improving ourselves and focusing on keeping the men fulfilled and satisfied provided shes a good woman with few negative attributes what cost is there maybe you give up the fact that all decisions are your own and you need to collaborate on things but some of us think two heads are better than one so if you and her are working well together you get a better output than alone and also a family and children if you want that anyway i agree with your view to secure assets gained before marriage prior to marrying and marrying when children will be imminent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well again thats wrong but i am not gonna google for the chart and send it to you it wont make a difference since your mind is made up also you just dismissed everything i said so dont act so up on your high horse of not dismissing men i wouldnt recommend women to rack up a high n count but life happens people make mistakes and learn its not a bad thing my boyfriend doesnt have an issue with it and i dont have an issue with it you asked me if i thought the insecurity was warranted and i said no i dont think it is its fine to accept that youre not always gonna be the best as long as youre with a person who doesnt expect you to be the best theres wiggle room in there to be less than perfect and its not worth feeling insecure about personally i have felt insecure about various things and find i am much happier when i am not insecure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right as ive said before look it up its not hard to find
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,buying the cow in this case means you get the milk whenever you want ie sex whenever you want rather than a one time thing with one person rofl i believed this in my first marriage but years of a deadbedroom proved me wrong what are the costs of marriage if the woman is good and wont cheatdivorce you what if you found a way to minimize all those risks what if the woman lets you do your thing doesnt nag or demand gives sex freely and willingly it isnt necessarily about nagging or doing his own thing its being responsible to and for another person gives sex freely sounds great in theory but doesnt come by default with the wedding ring and men would be well served to understand that clearly but in general my advice to young men is specifically to minimize those risks and the rest of what you wrote i agree completely but its really not just women that are unprepared for marriage because if men were better prepared they wouldnt be marrying unprepared women theyd instead recognize the red flags and pass but its fairly obvious that isnt happening in many cases and in many ways rp is showing men exactly how to go about vetting women for those qualities and it seems many arent very thrilled about that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well again thats wrong but i am not gonna google for the chart and send it to you it wont make a difference since your mind is made up the vast majority of studies prove you wrong but okay think what you want in your blue pill fantasy la la land where girls can get run train on and still come out a good church girl its fine to accept that youre not always gonna be the best thats not something i should have to compromise on in my view
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wouldnt recommend women to rack up a high n count but life happens people make mistakes and learn its not a bad thing well past experience and research show that that is a very bad thing because it doesnt bode well for that womans ability to keep a relationship going or even find compatible partners
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right as ive said before look it up its not hard to find actually there is a lot of noiseevo psych articles to sort thru to find signal also you are the one who made the unbelievable claim that there are more subs of women dedicated to slut shaming then male subs frame doesnt substitute from backing up your claim it happens in business too implying someone else is mistaken to misdirect attention from the weakness of your own position so ill just write off your claim since its not my problem to prove your position no wonder smv is highest for women age empty frame alone doesnt work so well on the more experienced
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,racism is not a virtue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do you know she isnt black
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh well im actually not really attracted to any other races but i dont see why that would be a problem anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,idc if they arent fulfilled its not a mans world or a womans world so we both need to be able to be satisfied your first wife sounds horrible im focused on deadbedroom prevention yeah i agree men and women are both fairly unprepared one of the things im trying to do is figure out the right things women and men need to learn then help others
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats you and thats fine but that means that you know your insecurity is not being the best you can move forward appropriately from there also theres this httpfamilystudiesorgcounterintuitivetrendsinthelinkbetweenpremaritalsexandmaritalstability since you said i live in a fantasy land i took offense to it i was looking at this study last week and i knew i didnt make up what i saw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,correlation isnt causation why do people forget this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i didnt make any claims about subs that stuff doesnt even matter you are the one who introduced the whole idea of of subs no wonder smv is highest for women age empty frame alone doesnt work so well on the more experienced this doesnt make any sense those girls have the highest smv because they are the most desired full stop it has nothing to do with the guys frame older women are simply less desirable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,caring about your own people is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your first wife sounds horrible im being honest when i say this my ex wife is one of the better people ive known in my life we were horrible together but as a person shes actually very pleasant in fact id say shes a better human than i am but id say the same about my current wife as well i sometimes pass as human on a good day p im focused on deadbedroom prevention these days me too but thats not so difficult i just need to continue being the hottest man my wife has any hope of being with and ensure that she knows i know that without being an asshole about it at our age my home court advantage increases by the day as long as i can at least hold my ground another decade on the looks side of the equation but i made if very clear up front that i would never be trapped in a sexless marriage again anyway so yes as bad as the sphere says it is to make such demands i pretty much drew a line in the sand before we married and told her in no uncertain terms i wouldnt move it there will be no pleading or begging if the sex starts to dwindle ill make it known im not happy with it and if things dont change ill be packing my crap of course my main goal is to never let the sex dwindle this time in the first place
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one study versus the many that say the opposite ill go with the vast majority
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it has nothing to do with the guys frame older women are simply less desirable how convenient
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,au contraire your interpretation is the convenient one for you im just speaking the truth its too bad if youre offended by it im just a messenger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whatever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,according to we have the majority of women have one sexual partner in a month period and in their lifetime usual caveats about selfreported data etc but this is the best youre gonna get on this topic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,low under average high super high over this is where it starts to be a cause for concern for ltrmarriage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what range in numbers would give her a high low and average n count low n average n high n to be fair i use the same scale for men also how did you come to your conclusion that these numbers actually represent reality because most of the women i knowhave known were in the average segment so they are obviously what the majority are doing i just personally think anyone with an n higher than either really enjoys sex or is shitty at keeping relationships going goes for both sexes the low is because im and my n is and im positive there are other single women like me out there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,low mid probably too high im ignoring the actual stats they count all kinda of low n people like kids who got married in high school or just after
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it completely depends on the man on what his manhamster is spinning in that particular moment on whether the girl fucked him or not on whether she humiliated him or not men are very emotional when it comes to women and use the slut card as a defence thats why feminism is great because it shames the misogynist slutshamed instead
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,low or under average high
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,twenty two billion and three quarters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is highly subjective personally i think anything double digits is high and qualifies her as slut low or average n last published cdc selfreport survey for women national average across all demographics is but thats self reporting and we all know how women report and count their own ns
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id say normal range is anywhere from id consider low id consider high
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the formula is pretty much if her count is higher than that thats too much but at any age doubledigits is high actually if its pushing there its high which agrees with since above above average and low theres no such thing as low the fewer the better but then again not sure what you meant lowhigh compared to other girls or high as in too high for a relationshipnot to be considered a slut because when we say high n count we usually mean the latter and i replied in that context otherwise just according to a link conisder a normal curve with a maximum at and idk what standard deviation didnt really read into that paper yet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you are considering an ltr the relevant number threshold is according to studies higher than that and the risk of divorce goes up to ideally
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most modern women are sluts thats why youre confused high n is when n
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thanks for the information this is actually consistent with my personal experience i find it just about impossible to fathom how women are so meh about sex outside relationships i cant imagine having the opportunity for sex at any given time on any given day and ending up with a laycount of
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the majority of women have one sexual partner in a month period and in their lifetime hmmm i guess all those httpsenwikipediaorgwikitinderappusers and the casual dating profiles on pof are just women wanting to look at pictures and make friends like theyre on facebook
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah im a little more charitable as well these stats are more in line with my experienceobservations
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just posted almost the same i agree with your general range
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just personally think anyone with an n higher than either really enjoys sex or is shitty at keeping relationships going i think that both of the reasons you give are why trpers have valid grounds for being wary of a woman with a high n count
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about i have to know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but thats self reporting and we all know how women report and count their own ns but i only gave them blow jobs and only let a few other guys ejaculate inside my vagina but that doesnt actually count as sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most girls in college though have strings of month relationships i dont think is that high
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol red pillers want good girls but next women if they dont give it up on the first dates theyre basically selecting out the women they want most hahahahaa
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do i have to subtract the lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also marrying younger women increases the risk of divorce
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wait so everybody who isnt a virgin is a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats dumb most people arent marrying their first
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol ok
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,please post circlejerk comments as a reply to the automod comment in this thread thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is because men and women are different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,firsttime sex is usually terrible for women the sex is like pizza adage isnt true for them it gets better as she gets to know the guy and he learns her body and how to make her come but unless hes a prodigious lover the first encounter usually leaves a lot to be desired a sober woman will almost never yes i know there are exceptions fuck a guy she just met unless theres something else in it for her because sex alone isnt worth the rigamaroll even if hes totally clean for example she could still end up with a really painful uti or yeast infection honestly thats why a lot of women will just blow a guy the first time its a gesture that shes sexually interested but without all the risks of piv sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant imagine having the opportunity for sex at any given time on any given day and ending up with a laycount of this is because women are about their ncount think about it given that women dont want to be perceived as sluts because it lowers their value in the eyes of others if she lies to you with a low ncount ive only had sex with two men who were my boyfriends and she with a low ncount that ons doesnt count what makes you think she wont do the same to researchers conducting a study women especially young attractive women are fucking more men than theyre willing to admit even if its for research
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mine is with being ltrs for me at least feeling horny and actually wanting to have sex with someone are different things i get horny maybe about once a week but that can be solved by masturbation however my desire to have sex only gets activated when i socialize with someone i am strongly attracted to thus far this has not included the majority of my social circle or colleagues and finally casual sex does not make me feel good did it once with a friend and did not like the experience hence this all adds up to me only having sex within relationships
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am one of these women i have no idea what my n count is but its well over ama
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the majority of women are not on tinder
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tinder hoes dont represent normal women see this is why yall are fucked up you spend your lives on tinder
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,swiped right actual met up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wouldnt you want your partner to enjoy sex though i mean id have a high n if i could lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im guessing that is on the highend of low or the lowend of average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ublackpillinc is correct
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,high if youre low if youre
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its pretty easy for a woman to get to couple of boyfriends one in high school one in college an ons and a couple of flings that she tried to get started but never got off the ground thats right there with no effort at all and all before age before shes even out of college no one is going to bat an eye at that no one is going to call that slutty outside of the most moral trpers i think it shows some lack of judgment myself but most people in todays society vast majority are going to view that as kind of conservative actually
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well the way i parse it out loses virginity to high school sweetheart graduates high school with an n a few random hookups but generally boyfriendsfwb n post college continue with college fwbbf or start dating a bit more seriously selectively n ps i realized in writing this i appear to have misunderstood ops question in that ive given what i find reasonable instead of what i think the average is id consider the average for a year old woman around with the qualifier that i know several girls in that age bracket with ncounts in the and some with ncounts of or less
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they think theyre so alpha that surely a woman will give it up to them even if shes resisted other guys
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,given that most marriages involve a woman who is anywhere between years younger than her husband that would imply a divorce rate higher than it is marriages are more likely to succeed if they match a mans economically rising productive years generally with a womans peak fertile years that is no guarantee though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,n not n
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,doesnt mean they do the right thing lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i know it just seems weird to me how the different cocktail of sex hormones pumping through a man or womans endocrine system can turn out to create such disparities in every facet of our lives on a slight tangent this is why i think that it seems impossible for men and women to empathise with each other over certain issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,false i am a woman like this its not even uncommon women are just forced to pretend we dont like to sleep around because slut is considered a bad thing in our society
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,providing women with pleasurable sex is not some rare or mystical property its just the norm i dont understand why subs like these seem to think that its something which you can only achieve through some kind of cheat code women dont get off because of bad sex average to good sex will satisfy them easily the thing that seems strange to a man is the mentality of he didnt satisfy me so ill just wait here passively and maybe eventually find another guy who i like who will maybe satisfy me more if men struggled to find partners who would sexually satisfy them then we would double triple quadruple quintuple etc our efforts to find women who do i think that the std worry is overplayed the risk of infection applies to men just as it does to women yet unless a womans vagina is dripping with pustulent sores then a guy will still hit it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats sex oral counts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the go to response to every survey that tends to contradict trp or shed women in a good light should not always be lying liars its understandable that people would lie to friendsfamilypotential partners about things they feel shame about that same logic however doesnt apply to anonymous surveys despite that its conceivable that some portion of the survey takers did lie however its not plausible that so many lied to such an extreme that the truth is wildly different from the results you cannot hamster away every study you dont like as if it is completely meaningless bullshit this is cdc data with a very wide sample
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,while laycounts are generally underplayed or overplayed to impress others theres no way that the average young woman would end up with more than an average of lifetime partners when men get the opportunity of regular sex such as musicians sports stars actors etc they end up with laycounts in the quadruple figures let alone the triple figures compare say justin bieber with taylor swift shes probably had less than sexual partners whereas hes probably in the late hundreds possibly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i get horny maybe about once a week
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my count is same feelings about sex as rpwthrowaway that personality thoughthe right personality is attractive and beautiful and hot as all hell year old man here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have no idea what my n count is but its well over ama that just illustrates my point well over thats what men would acquire over a fortnight given the opportunity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how and where how attractive are you pics are welcome can be pm ofc oh also why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah most normal women dont look like the girls on tinder you blame us for spending our lives on tinder
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course enjoying sex is a huge positive for a woman but its only really a positive in the context of a monogamous relationship having a high laycount suggests that the woman not only enjoys sex but enjoys sex with multiple partners and thats an obvious detraction from her ltr potential
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it depends on many things but especially where you live if you are a female in rural areas you are still marrying early and the number of men available to you is limited to your town contrast that to the city and college a competitive area like nyc where single college educated women outnumber single college men means n counts are much higher it also means that its overall more difficult to lock someone down even as a man because high n counts for women reduces the bonding that occurs during sex thousand cock stare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its pretty easy for a woman to get to couple of boyfriends one in high school one in college an ons and a couple of flings that she tried to get started but never got off the ground thats right there with no effort at all and all before age before shes even out of college this is what i also think i used an example of a woman because its hard to imagine someone of that age not sleeping with men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,be civil
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh darn lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can tell you right now marrying my first bf at would have been the exact wrong thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah it is definitely an interesting thing to think about slight chemical changes in your brain can affect your behaviour and the way you life your entire life so much
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good for you but youre a statistical anomaly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you mistook my meaning women are rarely satisfied by first time sex once a guy has gotten to know her body and what makes her tick it gets much better and thats why women generally have pretty low partner counts relative to their number of opportunities an attractive woman could get laid by a different attractive guy every night if she wanted but if she actually wants to get off and have good sex shes better off investing time in a fwb and if she doesnt have a guy on call she can whip out her vibrator and do herself better than a tinder booty call could and utis and yeast infections arent stds they result from sex with clean dudes all the time guys can technically get them too but its really rare theyre just a common side effect of sex for a lot of women and theyre painful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually its not the norm most women are not pleased with their partner in bed i can dig up the source if you want me to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,providing women with pleasurable sex is not some rare or mystical property its just the norm i dont understand why subs like these seem to think that its something which you can only achieve through some kind of cheat code my hunch pointing towards underwhelming sex is simply so goddamn convenient it gives women an easy way out when it comes to justfying why women abstain from sex and puts the blame for any sexual shortcoming solely on men both serves to obscure that women simply contrary to popular belief and their own admission will do kinkier stuff sooner and with less prompting as long as youre hot enough by pointing at mens lacking sexual prowess however they deflect their attention and redirect it inwards if you were just better in bed i would totally treat you like smoothiemcdreamy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i had lots of ons and they were great and the men were great in bed over all and always concerned with my pleasure becaus ebeing good in bed was liek a competitive point of pride for them not because they were so giving and tender or whatever these reports have always seemed so weird to me granted im from a different generation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,edited 😒
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure it does women are lying even to themselves about how they count their ns to most women the only sex that counts in their ns is sober p in v sex with men with whom they have or had relationships and where the men ejaculated the following dont count for most women oral only anal only drunk sex ons flings any sex that didnt take place with a boyfriend fiancé or husband he didnt come i didnt come i wish i hadnt had sex with him regret sex it was bad sex vacation sex spring break sex sex with reynaldo the hawt bartender or jose the cabana boy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its just a survey its not science it doesnt really matter if it contradicts or confirms it anyway that being said it doesnt sound so improbable people are just having cognitive dissonance because they are too focused on sluts and dont see girls who dont sleep around have full families no daddy issues ltr boyfriends etc on the other hand they are right this data is worthless women do lie or maybe the count n differently without hard evidence its hard to conclude anything not to mention that every single woman who was asked probably had her own criteria of what counts as n probably different from mens criteria but then this study is completely worthless for this sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,absolutely and the cdc has a strong incentive to correct for massive lying and encourage truthfulness its hard to model std spread off of bullshit data
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no way that the average young woman would end up with ore than an average of lifetime partners remember your earlier statement i cant imagine having the opportunity for sex at any given time on any given day and ending up with a laycount of so how can you be so sure women arent taking advantage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is ridiculous this kind of research surveys does not require you to disclose your identity why would a woman be lying same reason selfreporting penis size studies show a larger average then the other ones people round up a little to make themselves feel good a woman might round down a little or discount a few experiences that didnt really count
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women lie about their ns even anonymously because they are lying even to themselves they dont want to admit even to themselves their true ns
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hahaha im personally glad i dont get horny too much i would find it annoying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha how can you say that when you have no idea how many guys ive slept with i estimate i sleep with a new guy every month for the last years thats a hell of a lot more than most men do in their entire lives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im pretty attractive im white fit big butt i lived in a college town in texas until about years ago now im in a non college texas town going to medical school why because i like flirting with hot people i like the excitement of a first time i like the novelty of a new person i like the confidence that comes with getting affection from a hot guy i like feeling wanted and sexy oh and orgasms i think i have a pic posted in my history
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes they do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i disagree here whenyoure single you dont have one partner to be faithful to i always preferred one partner im super monogamous when i was single i didnt have one and was trying to find one so sleeping with different men aka dating in center city philadelphia lol was how you did that i have always asserted that a woman who is a cheating risk is a woman who can carry on simultaneous concurrent flings or relationships wiith multiple men i am wholly unable to do this i am focussed on the man of the man of the moment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is there an inherent problem with someone wanting to have fun with numerous partners though my own guy has an n of if you include me and i still sometimes get jealous of his ability to experience sex with different people im not saying he shouldnt have had fun with the people in his pastfar from it im glad he did because hes a great lover and he should be able to have great sex with others but if i could do the same and make other people happy with the knowledge i have id be more fulfilled doesnt mean id love my guy any less after all hes the one who taught me lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok good to know but how is that relevant to the current discussion never did i mention marriage you did all i said women with n higher than are sluts which you never challenged
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,man here cant imagine sleeping with someone outside of a committed relationshipit would probably just feel empty to me im only attracted to people who i have known for a while though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can dig up the source if you want me to yes please
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most women arent pleased with much at all not sure what stats about anything would prove
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see how you can possibly make such wild assumptions i dont know any women placing such filters on their sex lives and lying to themselves about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because you cant have indiscriminate sex or multiple sexual dalliances without other people knowing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok so women are lying down a little and men are lying up doesnt mean the average woman has sex partners in a lifetime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so that means that youve slept with roughly people in years given the opportunity most men would clock up that number in less than a month
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youre saying its very common is there any way to minimize the chances a girl lies about her count im just terrified my girlfriend or potential girlfriend had that type of history and will lie besides youre saying you fit so thats concerning i thought fit girls know their value and understand that sex is easy to get and would like for one best man over multiple men so now i dont even know how to navigate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no they dont skinny pretty girls are the majority of women where sweden
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the problem is that having sex with multiple people in the past is a huge indicator of someones potential current and future sexual behaviour your man may have had sex with people but considering that sex is not exactly laid on a plate for men youd have to assess the opportunities and circumstances of those sexual relationships
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because its a ridiculous claim for you to make and the idea behind highlow n is ltrmarriage material thats how we usually discuss it the connotation being that if your n is only you either married your first partner or you want never had sex again high n is more than thats insane
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men have a similar number of partners on average anyway vast majority of men do not sleep around much
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpwwwhealthywomenorgcontentarticlenewsurveymostwomenarenotsatisfiedtheirsexlives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah ok sohttpwwwhealthywomenorgcontentarticlenewsurveymostwomenarenotsatisfiedtheirsexlives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think youre referring to two different situations
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but then why are all the stories where turns out a gf lied about her past and shes like oh i didnt know it counts its in the past blablah but its pretty cool if absolutely no woman you now lies about her n and really counts everything nice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,promiscuous women arent all that concerned with strangers being aware of her promiscuity just those in her social circle family friends coworkers and in those instances women are prudent to minimize the appearance of promiscuity which is one of the reasons she prefers sex at the mans house rather than hers no one she knows is in the vicinity these same women also tend to have likeminded female friend who is very aware of her promiscuity but doesnt judge and covers for her you typically see them in pairs at the bars and clubs they have an understanding that both are there to get laid so no woman can accuse the other of being a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see how you can discount a ons do you really not see how someone can lie to themselves we were drunk and he couldnt stay hard for more than a few minutes it was just oral sex i didnt orgasm and he came after pump doesnt realllly count so im not going to include it people tell little lies to themselves all the time unless you think that all the guys self reporting in those penis size studies just happen to all be accidentally measuring a larger size than they are you have to be able to see how women could be reporting lower numbers than they have selfreported answers may be exaggerated respondents may be too embarrassed to reveal private details various biases may affect the resultshttpsenwikipediaorgwikisocialdesirabilitybias subjects may also forget pertinent details selfreport studies are inherently biased by the persons feelings at the time they filled out the questionnaire if a person feels bad at the time they fill out the questionnaire for example their answers will be more negative if the person feels good at the time then the answers will be more positive this exact scenario is covered by the term social desirability bias take a look at the wiki article
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its in the way women count their ns they exclude everything except p in v sex that happened with a bf fiancé or husband
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,statistically thats not true at all most men have what partners or less in their ent re lives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i do like the best men as in whoever i deem best but i wont be ready for marriage for another years minimum so should i just be celibate until then im going to enjoy my life to the fullest i dont want to have regrets as for the number thing i wouldnt worry about it focus on being sexually compatible and compatible in all other ways date until you feel like you know her inside and out that might take a couple of years but it will tell you much more than any single number would
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you mean to tell me all the women on tinder are bony and look like models
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,with me he waited months before we had piv sex because i was a virgin with some issues from my past that made sex very difficult for me in the meantime we gradually escalated from kissing to cuddling to heavy petting to oral sex etc weve now been lovers for years and have done lots of stuff one of his previous was a ons with a lab partner from one of his college courses the other were from ltrs he had from the time he was
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope just because outof wedlock sex has become the norm doesnt mean it is the right thing if you ask what a slut is i give you the answer whether you like it or not if you do not want to be called a slut do not have sex out of wedlock and do not divorce choose wisely or embrace the title of a slut there is nothing wrong with being one after all right even if after twenty years feminist infestation makes women into complete ncount whores theyll still be called sluts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have you got a reputable source
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this does not dispute what i said in any way you think most guys are satisfied
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,promiscuous women arent all that concerned with strangers being aware of her promiscuity just those in her social circle family friends coworkers you literally just claimed women are lying about their counts on anonymous surveys make up your mind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,promiscuous women arent all that concerned with strangers being aware of her promiscuity just those in her social circle family friends coworkers and its her social circle who know about how many sexual partners she has no woman in my social circle has had more than an average of sexual partner per year theres just no way to keep multiple sexual dalliances on the downlow when friends family and work could easily check up on you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure women care about friends knowing of their promiscuity they accept that their closest girlfriends know about their promiscuity because they wont judge at least not to her face because well theyre just as slutty as she is if not more so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep nothing wrong at all with being a slut as long as youre ethical about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your best men means nothing if your n count is double digits sorry no you arent supposed to be celibate thats the funny thing about the number it wont increase if you sleep with the same person also leads to more pleasure in general
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the ones worth fucking yeah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill have to agree with ublackpillinc on this generally speaking stats show that the higher the number of previous sex partners the greater the chance of a relationship not working your case is interesting as you even admit you were a virgin before you met your man my guess is that your man got over his party years and wanted to settle down high n counts make it harder for you to bond to one another but this is especially true for women and we have studies that show this sexual bonding is extremely important every time a woman sleeps with a new man her ability to sexually bond with him lowers this is why you have women in their with high n counts just unable to bond with new lovers it also causes psychological damage if you ever heard of the thousand cock stare its a very real thing women are emotional creatures and breaking sexual bonds hurts this is also why women were slut shamed slut shaming was a way to keep other women in line and to keep the process of people marrying and bonding together go smoothly this is why female virgins were and still are highly prized because the chances of a stable relationship is very high in fact i know of this single handedly one of my best friends met a female virgin in college or years ago and they are married with kids now sleeping around is always easier for men and has little effect on their ability to bond
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good god you have some high and unreasonable expectations of people i hope that works out for you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,reputable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah xd men are easy to please all you have to do is rub their dick for minutes female orgasms are more complex than that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i only meant in local situations such as kissing a man she just met at the club and walking into his house with the neighbors watching she still wont tell a stranger her real ncount though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres just no way to keep multiple sexual dalliances on the downlow when friends family and work could easily check up on you implying that shes on some sort of sexual probation with people following her every move and calling her every minutes just checking in to make sure youre at home in bed im sitting outside looking through your windows with binoculars no one is either checking up on her or even demanding that she stays an innocent good girl but she doesnt want to broadcast her promiscuous behavior either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sexual partner per year more like one sexual partner per month and thats being generous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have seen how women count their ns through numerous conversations online and off with women about how they count their ns and the above is pretty much exactly how they do it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you tell us please
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can have as many amazing men as i want i dont understand what youre saying i dont want to stay with the same person the guy i lost my virginity to at is currently a college drop out ive moved on to bigger and better things which is good for me some people might find their one at and only have one partner but either way is fine having partners or partner is fine neither one is wrong or bad its just different styles of living
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right just like in real life so youre only noticing the cute ones
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,please link me to these studies genuinely interested not the american heritage study because that one doesnt say anything about bonding
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,generally speaking stats show that the higher the number of previous sex partners the greater the chance of a relationship not working our relationship is fine despite his high n your case is interesting as you even admit you were a virgin before you met your man its not like i wanted to be i just have issues with touch and intimacy that the overwhelming majority of guys seem to lack any patience or empathy for my guess is that your man got over his party years and wanted to settle down ha um no we are not settled down in any sense of the word we are noncohabitating lovers and friends we are not engaged we are both single uncommitted and i at least have no desire or plans to marry if he wants to get hitched hell have to find someone else he already got a vasectomy years ago so i know he doesnt want kids which works for me cause im not about that life in fact he has recommended for me to date and get more sexual experience numerous times he doesnt think its good to only have partner in your entire life and for the most part i agree high n counts make it harder for you to bond to one another but this is especially true for women and we have studies that show this we have studies that kind of show this theres the one christianhigh family values organization study that i know of and that one only took the female side of the equation into account as such said study shows a correlation but not a causation we need the same study to be done on men in order to truly extrapolate anything from this information plus there are other factors that could affect the idea of bonding other factors like age personal beliefs an individuals past family relations amount of trust how one partner actstreats the other or religious expectations can also effect how long a relationship lasts women are emotional creatures and breaking sexual bonds hurts im glad im not like that my guy is far far more emotional than i sleeping around is always easier for men and has little effect on their ability to bond i do not believe this for a second women bond through oxytocin men bond through vasopressin both of these flood the respective brains during and after sex people tend to forget this and assume only women have bonding chemicals whereas it has been shown that women recuperate from divorcesseparations far quicker because of how these chemicals work hence why we see so many more men than women committing suicide becoming alcoholics engaging in drug use or becoming severely depressed when their women leave them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,high n counts make it harder for you to bond to one another but this is especially true for women and we have studies that show this sexual bonding is extremely important every time a woman sleeps with a new man her ability to sexually bond with him lowers this is why you have women in their with high n counts just unable to bond with new lovers i think this is bunk i didnt get together with my guy until i was and had had dozens of lovers by that point but i had no problem pairbonding with him its trauma that makes people reluctant to love trust and be authentic with their partners one horribly bad relationship can do more damage than scores of carefree flings
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id say feminism has led to cultural degradation instead i mean if we were on an islamic board where stoning and lashing people was the norm would you hesitate calling them barbarians and uncivilized
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not a womens gossip website
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this does not dispute what i said in any way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youre saying that for example a nonpartying female coworker is getting pounded by random men outside her social circle your premise is absurd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe for the crowd you hang out with but there would have to be a hell of a lot of lying to get from partner per month to cdc numbers birds of a feather flock together
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im saying that if you just liked sex you would find and have all the sex you want instead you like taking multiple dicks so call things their names please but either way is fine having partners or partner is fine neither one is wrong or bad its just different styles of living no not really some things are fine some are not as long as you arent hiding your sexual history from potential boyfriends though its not that bad yes just keep in mind that judging for it and not wanting to date a person because of her partner count is also fine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would i notice the ones who arent cute oo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would reference this study which covers divorce odds extensively looking at the studies the two highest odds of a woman divorcing a man remember we will always look at it in this frame of reference because the majority of divorces are initiated by women are her education and if she has had sex before marriage keep in mind that many colleges are party grounds for rampant wild sex a women having sex with one other partner is a whopping increase in the odds of divorce with another drop for a second partner and another for a fifth related to this her having sex before age is another major risk factor reference page and page httpfamilystudiesorgcounterintuitivetrendsinthelinkbetweenpremaritalsexandmaritalstability which shows that there is a strong link between premarital sex and marriage stability the more premarital sex the more likely of divorce what i like about this study is that it covers multiple decades a study that shows the lingering psychological damage of sexual partners
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im glad im not like that my guy is far far more emotional than i and im the king of england women recuperate from divorcesseparations far quicker because of how these chemicals work no they dont hence why we see so many more men than women committing suicide becoming alcoholics engaging in drug use or becoming severely depressed when their women leave them its waaaayy more complicated than that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its trauma that makes people reluctant to love trust and be authentic with their partners well thanks for proving my point lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is a womens health website but if you really want me to ill find another source
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,removed this general topic is fine but right its inflammatory beyond whats needed to describe the core issues feel free to rework this and submit again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree even the pickiness thing is general is a bit weird women are women the hot ones are nice but even the plain ones are still nice i mean if they are deformed and repulsive its a different story but you generally dont want to talk about disgusting chicks its being purposefully put in your face for some reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive heard plenty of conversations between men where they call some girls ugly make fun of others etc however that was in high school most older guys dont do as much at least the well educated ones dont for me personally its just more negativity that i dont need in my mind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,natural alphas do not need trp men who seek out the redpill are betas or omegas who hope to imitate or pretend alpha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the sort of finicky sexual expression found in lowt what does this even mean you taking shit bout my femboys
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe its because internetdwelling incels and red pillers feel that they have to actively distance themselves from ugly women for fear of getting put in the same league as them whereas natural alphas who are not faking it and have real confidence see themselves as being placed by society into the same league as hot women and thus they arent as concerned with letting others know that they think ugly girls are ugly its insecurity betas who aspire to be alphas feel like they need to issue daily reminders of which women they in fact do not want to have sex with so that we wont accidentally couple them together in our imaginations remember i dont want to bang just so you know but if these men were actually alpha they wouldnt say stuff like that because everyone would assume they go after and achieve sex with hotter women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,man im no chad no natural and i never heard someone spontaneously saying that line as youve noticed there are lots of would bang not wouldnt you have a lot of questioning about the boundaries though its not about a guy saying he wouldnt bang it is a guy who would bang a chick but knows shes ugly inquiring whether another guy would
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont understand what your trying to say here this sounds like a long rant what prevents a healthyadjusted man from berating or negatively commenting on a womans appearance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,male locker room talk between healthy adjusted men consists more of how would you know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you a guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what was wrong with it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you do you perceive a lot of the women in tv and movies to e disgusting i was kind of saying the opposite most are attractive in some way most of the time i watch something at home with men around it devolves into id hit it id hit it would you hit it yeah id still hit it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i heard this on the bus going to school years ago i hang out with men my age and they dont censor themselves around me they might tell a joke about an ugly feature or use a pun they are not in the habit of discussing unattractive women they want talk about whether or not theyd hit it the answer is almost always yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you think this post illustrates an accurate example of that difference
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no im talking about guys who tend to have weird hang up about looks they tend be systematizer guys or towards one end of the autism spectrum or fussier and more prone towards discomfort or disgust than most
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the title and your general approach to the topic its fine to start a thread about the kind of language trpers use but its not good to start a thread that amounts to saying redpillers are likely ugly and low value due to that language how can that be debated your title is an issue too so youll have to repost
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what i literally just said i agree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gender theory and the war of the sexes has no materialist basis so to be honest i do not side either way i think trpers and bloopers are equally obsessed with identity politics however does it feel right yes in my experience most people that are characterized as natural alphas dont need to validate themselves or their position by ragging on ugly girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are going to need to explain this better because i have no clue what stereotype you are trying to make me have a mental image of
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i understand what youre saying id rather edit around those parameters than have it removed again i only made one reference to the looks of the speakers at the end that can be changed the idea that men who have fewer options tryingharder to create that impression is not that controversial it seems a fair amount of people related to the theme of the post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you said disgusting chicks are put in your face where does this happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have you ever seen a movie or tv show with women like those linked and said would you hit it yeah id hit it in front of other men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,unfortunately reddit will not let you edit titles so editing this post is not an option
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like if someone goes theres yo girl and then points to some landwhale or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,el o el i dont watch movies or tv much to be honest i have male friends who are natural alphas you could say i am an average looking chick they are cool hanging out with me in public and even being somewhat flirtatious they dont rag on girls and are friendly to most women they encounter my beta or omega friends worry about possibly being viewed as couple they openly denigrate women they think are unattractive they struggle with understanding how ugly or average women can get sex while they cant alphas dont give a fuck again this is so inconclusive to me because its not grounded in anything its anecdotal its immaterial
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you alright
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just tell me what to ommitreword and i will resubmit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,does a fat woman having confidence threaten you in some way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a frivolous post im not making an important point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im here so obviously not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one thing i have noticed a lot on trp which correlates with neckbeard stereotypes is the low appraisal of womens looks would not bang which is part of what substantiates the idea that men on trp not the alphas they claim to be and many are trying to imitate how they think men with options think and act virtually all of the men i have interacted with will talk about how theyd hit that all the time and rarely appraise womens looks negatively unless its for a punchline in a joke women who are legitimately unattractive are not on their radar they neednt even entertain these women as options so they are either invisible or nonsexual and are not a source of frustration or pain for them they dont really need to prove to other men they can attract good looking women as they date and hook up with good looking women they even hook up with not goodlooking women when convenient and make no effort to hide it or talk shit about it because they have little to prove male locker room talk between healthy adjusted men consists more of id hit it than would not bang men rarely try to impress each other with their potency by talking about which women they couldnt get it up for i have heard men of above average attractiveness talk about how they would hit ugly betty or this old hag or this dyke delete all the text after the paragraph above edit your title so its less circlejerky for example trp and locker room talk
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no she is just disgusting and unpleasant to look at
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,got it was that so hard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i understand that but wouldnt her overcompensating for this be funny rather than a source of anger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah it was awful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its funny in the same way that something that smells bad can be funny i guess you can have fun with your friends playing jokes on each other
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,kisses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we recognise a small one though thats what matters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its like men and tits yeah we like nice big titties but its not just about size shape and perkiness matters and theres a point of diminishing returns only weird fetishist men would want a woman with the biggest boobs on the world similarly if a woman has a banging booty flat stomach and beautiful face we can overlook an a cup with cock yes a big dick is nice but only a select few want the biggest cock in the world bigger and thicker is always better but if everything else you have is 🔥 and youre peen is average youll do fine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my personal opinion if a woman has seen so many dicks that she can determine the size on sight or based on the feeling in her vagina shes seen way too many dicks to be considered for a longterm partner anyway butthurt feminists saying i have a small dick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,penis size doesnt matter and most women wouldnt even recognise a big cock if they saw one cant wait for all the white women to respond dont disappoint me ppd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i actually agree i have seen one really big one that was intimidating one that was smaller and the rest all seem about average i wouldnt actually be able to tell you length and girth just that they were the right size for me that is usually how i judge it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just dont understand ive seen this conversation thousands of time why pray tell are there all these men who no matter how hard you try cant be convinced that women dont really give a shit about how big your dick is as long as its within two standard deviations of the mean ie not under inches or so all these men keep insisting it counts for so much and women tell them otherwise but they argue how did we get to this point why wont they take womens word for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women cant measure penis size for shit that doesnt mean they dont have a invariable preference it matters in keeping a woman interested in you so pretty much any sexual situation thats not a ons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when i see comments about how women will only fuck big dicked men i just wonder how these women are determining a mans dick size without sleeping with him do they carry around a ruler and try to catch him by surprise or what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it makes a difference for women with longer vaginas though for women with longer vaginas longer penises are obviously more satisfying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have a relatively high ncount over now and have had lots of conversations with women about penis size i also happen to be a bit over inches myself pics in my profile for those who are curious i have been the biggest several women have had but quite a few have been with guys bigger than me as well nearly all women have also had at least one story about a guy who was really small only a few ever said it was disqualifying however its important to remember that women have a huge variety in vaginally shapes and sizes too when you find a good matching fit magic at that point it does not matter who is big or small everything just works want to know what the biggest complaint always was tho lack of endurance i can pretty much cum when i want to so marathon sex is usually on the menu that has won me more compliments and fans than anything else probably by a factor of penis size was always mentioned last oh yeah you have a really nice cock too if at all so if you inexperienced guys want to make a positive impression in bed you will get more mileage from learning to control your orgasm than anything else you can do full stop being a minute man is a potential problem having an average sized or smaller dick is not likewise having a wine bottle sized schlong is not a cureall either especially if you cannot last more than a few minutes my
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im part of this myself and i have a bit of a different experience women absolutely can tell and they gossip amongst themselves about this its not just length though girth is also a big part of the picture cm in length or girth really makes a difference try folding paper next to yourself when youre erect in an average size and compare also the sex feels completely different for many women some women who rarely or never vaginally orgasm can do this consistently with me that being said its correct that being well endowed doesnt help you get laid it does help you keep getting laid with the same woman though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this post reminds me of that episode of south park where they had the anger management group and it was because they all had small dicks and randy ended up attempting to change things so he could feel better about him by the way penis size is the last thing you should worry about i mean my dick is this size which is totally bigger then average guys im super serious totally nothing to worry about despite the fact that im bigger then average its nothing to worry about its not something i think about everyday guys
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as it turns out im well above average in statistical terms you made this post just to say this didnt ya i said it in the other post size doesnt matter but most people are to inexperienced with the variety to know that size doesnt matter
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most white men have perfectly normal adequate sized weiners that are neither remarkably big nor small and do the trick source seen of white mens weiners lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,unless its small no point worrying except to make up for it but small dicks are evident
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all this proves is you dont talk to many women they know to see the erect penis before judging and even though they will say it doesnt matter it does there is a difference between smashing a girls cervix and hitting the fornix absolutely no woman i know owns a vibe at an average size or lesser size unless it is for descrete carry and external use only they all have dildos and vibes that put the average man to shame again no woman i know will admit they prefer a penis that fills them but they all remember the hunk who had one edit slight correction i know one woman who due to medical issues is so shallow she will steer away from anything bigger than her pointer but that still means penis size matters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,on the one hand as owner of something well beyond that cutoff ive had girls tell me that they get the shakes in the good way lol just thinking about prior sex theyve had with me and other such flattery on the other hand many of those same girls would never get into a full on relationship with me the conclusion sure it matters for sex but not much else and the big takeaway that trpers refuse to understand apparently sex just isnt everything you can fuck a girl side to side style but if you arent compatible it just isnt going anywhere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as opposed to looking at the average you can look at which talks about what women actually want its a pretty detailed study though the sample size may be a bit small california women mostly whiteasian they concluded that if a man hovers around inches he should be fine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you really believed this you wouldnt have felt it necessary to clarify that youre personally well above average and that women tell you you have a giant penis you even throw it in again right at the end there that you have quite a large penis if you believed any of this you wouldnt have devoted half the text to talking about how big your dick is it comes off as humble bragging or trolling the way its presented
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most men fraud their dick size by inches im slightly under and women think its huge and think its like inches lol also i think of women are satisfied with their partners size
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is untrue humans have larger phalluses than other primates due to sexual selection if size didnt matter it would not be selected for
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,unfortunately a recent study where women picked dildos that they considered the perfect size resulted in an average desired length of inches
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it absolutely does not matter for me i never orgasm from piveveronly from fingers or oral doesnt mean i dont enjoy piv but i wont get an orgasm out of it no matter what size it is i also dated a guy who was very small years ago but our chemistry was off the charts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right that must be why the first schoolyard insult women come up with for guys is hes probably got a little dick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but when guys measure they always measure themselves when theyre at their peak size when youre getting measured by someone else i doubt youll be at your maximum at peak size im around inches but no way that would ever get measured in a study probably it would be at least half an inch shorter so already im thinking you can bump up that bell curve lel by a half inch that makes most guys who think they have slightly larger than average wangs really only have average wangs and that supposedly top probably i dont know only top then suddenly you do have lots of girls who have had larger dicks than yours given that guys with larger dicks are presumably going to be having more sex suddenly your larger than average penis is probably quite average for her my girlfriend can see when its swollen looking and at its largest and she can feel it too that relatively small difference makes a huge amount of difference because it starts hitting pleasure spots at the back of the vagina most girls might not be able to estimate the length but they know what looks good and what looks as if it will feel good the extra half inch matters if it didnt they wouldnt react the way they do when you push it in a bit further now its not going to matter that much for relationships maybe but that half an inch extra can be the difference between good sex and really good sex and thats going to matter in one way or another
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when youre talking about penis size youre talking about length and girth so its really about volume and the variation in terms of volume within the average range that we are told about between and inches is what i always hear is pretty big a girl who has been around has probably had a few inchers with girth and would definitely notice a substantial difference between that and a by inch one when you note the volume instead of merely the length you see that the size difference is huge that said they are terrible at judging size and its not uncommon for them to sleep with a guy whos packing but says its and theyll believe them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there was an authoritative study conducted on penis size this year kings college london and the nhs which is the health authority in britain collated the penis length and girth of men in worldwide projects where measurements were professionally made at least read what you are posting those were mainly measured flaccid only and only a few were measured erect this study found that the average penis size is inches it also found that only of men have a penis larger than inches which is because they added asians if you look at the data there are studies with several hundred indians that were measured erect and the biggest one was cm long and around indians arent that much smaller on average but big cocks just dont exist in india and the same is true for all the asians yes thats a painful pill to swallow in the us sample with only people there are already several guys with bigger girth and bigger length than all the asians combined if you include asians only have a penis larger than inches but if you only look at whites more than ten percent are larger than inches while this data cannot be confidently projected across a planet of billion people we can be confident considering the quantity of data that it is very accurate of those were measured erect and of those more than half were asians who evidently dont have big cocks yet such is the furore about penis size and the completely false impression that we get from porn i thought that i was probably below average porn is just a proof that people are bad at judging size with their eyes many porn stars are inches and even most of the bbc stars are only inch there arent any legit inchers in porn in practical terms almost all men are so close to average that there is an almost indiscernible difference between their penis sizes which again is only true for asians but others have more variation upwards for others there certainly is a difference take an average cock and a top ten percentile cock the bigger one has more than twice the volume but only does the shaft look twice as long but girth does make a huge difference furthermore even if you do have a big penis lets say you had a penis which would put you in the top probably you cant just go up to women and say to them alright darling statistically my penis is in the top of men so get your coat youve pulled or you could be honest and say you are in the top of nonasians if you must worry about something penis size is the absolute last thing that you should worry about unless its only average and thin
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its unfortunate for the guys who are small i feel great sympathy for those who are but it is a very statistically small group of men whose penises are too small to have enjoyable sex after all the penis is biologically intended to penetrate the vagina so it stands to reason that most penises will be big enough to do this and not so big that its uncomfortable for the woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the thing is a lot of women will look at an average sized penis and deem it small because its not porn sized hung porn has warped a lot of minds regarding the look and size of penises
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women do but often not in the best of ways
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the g spot is only inches deep on average so penis size is pretty irrelevant because vast majority of guys are gonna be longer than that while erect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only of men have a penis larger than inches even then the difference between a penis which would be considered completely mediocre and an unusually large penis is or approximately when flaccid not only does this make no practical difference you wouldnt even be able to tell the difference with the naked eye there are a very small percentage of men with unusually small penises and an equally small percentage of men with unusually large penises in the latter case it is probably of men who have a penis that when they take out women will notice that it is seriously large if women seriously desired this they would all be fishing around for the guy and they wouldnt even know that he fitted the bill until they were having sex theyd have to sleep with guys to find the one big dick guy on average so considering that virtually no women have sexual partners its pretty obvious that this wont be a significant component of their sexuality otherwise theyd be continually disappointed by everyone whereas the reality is that the overwhelming majority of women are perfectly happy with their partners penis if it makes you happy to believe otherwise be my guest but i cant understand why it would
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you explained this better than i could ever do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a good looking guy with an avg dick or an avg looker with a big one this is actually the real question how much women prioritize dick size and does it matter over looks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you da real mvp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep this how many women would be packing a tape measure to see if he measured up about the same am as men who can tell the difference between a c and a d
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the current guy im dating is slightly larger around than a red bull can the reactions hes had to this have been all over the board hes literally had longterm girlfriends where he had very little vaginal sex because they were afraid when i asked him about anal he said uh yeah i dont get to do that hes bigger and thicker is not always better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bigger and thicker is always better my vagina disagrees theres a limit to how big you can be before it gets uncomfortable andor painful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,although theres quite a large disparity in breast size and theyre also much more noticeable in everyday life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol this is one of the dumbest things i have ever heard too many dicks might be three it doesnt take a goddamned rocket scientist to assess penis size by sight or feel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive seen inch dicks but their girth was shit i think one was like but like what was said its not discernable from a really i love me a inch fat cock all the men ive been with have big inchers i bet or around that area the smallest ive been with had to be like inches i couldnt really feel it and it was weird but i would have kept dating him i was like a teen and he was years older so that didnt happen plus i wasnt very hot back then haha anyway the moral of the story is if your penis is in the range with a good girth its big in my mind even if it cant reach the cervix who really cares the g spot is right up front
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id actually love it if you explained this comment in a little more detail
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,porns affect on society plus you get the or women who will say anything under inches is small and men will listen to them over all the others because of confirmation bias like in ancient greece and rome smaller penises were considered better hence all the statues have small cocks larger ones were considered uncivilized and meant the man was stupid and we have writings from roman women disparaging large dicks just shows how society affects men and womens beliefs similar in a way to the modern example about black guys id hate to be the average black guy nowadays with a penis that aint inches long and as thick as a coke can yet all the studies showing minimal difference between race inch total between asian white and black and the colour of skins affect on perception same as wearing black clothes you look taller and slimmer and asians and blacks simply cannot escape the stereotypes of their size
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree with you that this issue is mostly irrelevant for many women but how did we get to this point why wont they take womens word for it well because many men fell they cant really trust a womens word when it comes to it most women wouldnt directly tell them they have a small penis either way or that they would prefer it in any other form or shape the same way many women wouldnt confess in much of other issues that they know would affect other peoples image about her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,probably the same reason women dont take mens word for it that we dont give a shit about at least half the stuff they worry about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women cant measure penis size for shit id say they are pretty good they can use their hands and such to measure you know like counting how much space there is between her fingers when she grabs your cock how many fists plus fingers your cock is long if it is longer than her hand or her forearm bigger than her foot or head etc ive had several women guesstimate me correct to a quarter of an inch in both length and girth you underestimate how good they can be at it if they learn how to do it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id imagine they go by stupid myths like hand and foot size to try filter it and if hes small either deal with it or claim to have lost interest and leave or laugh at him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,word spreads around and there are subtle signs like that deep rooted confidence and the way they carry themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not how it works its not like the inside of the vagina has more nerves the deeper in or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you need to reassess your definition of the word relatively my problem has always been lasting too long actually im always amazed by guys in porn who can seemingly cum on demand its a doubleedged sword because ive been with women who quite clearly have extremely low expectations regarding stamina and its nice to surprise them but then sometimes it can be hard for me to ejaculate which is a bit of the a pain in the arse also im getting too old and knackered for long sex sessions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sorry to hear you are so small
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,amen i bumped into too many men out in the wilds of the smp with big dicks but terrible technique lets just say none of those men got called back for repeat performances
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if thats inches then i must be measuring wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no there is nothing impressive about my penis at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have you seen other races penises
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only of guys have a penis larger than this is only larger than the average so any guy with a seriously big dick is in a tiny minority if women were seeking these guys out actively they would end up very frustrated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thanks thats an interesting study my contention would bethis study says inches is ideal my penis is very marginally shorter than this no woman would ever know but even a inch penis would they really even be able to tell the difference between this and a penis i would suggest not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my penis is only about longer than the average reported in the study
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if a bigger dick was the priority in a mate then the average size would be much bigger still case and point cows and belgian blues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats interesting because someone else provided another study which suggested that womens ideal size is inches
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well just because they like that size best doesnt mean they wont date a guy who has anything less
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,children are immature
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure why you are making these rash assertions but the data that i have seen indicates that even for the ethnic group that is largest black africanamerican the average is still only inches yet people routinely believe that the average across all races is inches or even more than this there is an article which suggests that average penis size in the congo is over inches while in north korea its just over inches which is obviously ridiculous but this page also notes that the bottom countries were all officially measured and not selfreported lengths there may be some racial variance but it is minimal just as the variations between most men are minimal but we can say extremely confidently that the average penis is smaller than was generally believed to be the case until recently
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,obesity is making penis size more important
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whats wrong with having a small wiener is anthony weiner some sort of prestigious individual now because his unit is large
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your penis doesnt have to be unable to penetrate to be small average or bigger than average brings more pleasure during penetration both physically and mentally during penetration
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,porn has warped a lot of minds regarding the look and size of penises yeah mens minds women dont give a shit about porn in most cases porn is aimed at men and consumed by men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i disagree porn penis irl would be absolutely terrifying to a lot of women we know they are ginormous and not the norm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats how it is i have a inchers and ive been told i have a small dick when it was erect girls nowadays want a dick so long you can tranverse her birth canal all the way to china with it unrealistic standards
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that virtually no women have sexual partners ahahahahahaha stop hanging out with nuns will ya lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if women seriously desired this they would all be fishing around for the guy and they wouldnt even know that he fitted the bill until they were having sex theyd have to sleep with guys to find the one big dick guy on average unfortunately this is one of those i read something on the internet once but i read on the internet year ago that men with large dicks have more sexual partners than average and small men it even said double so that would mean women are exposed to them more than their frequency in the population suggests
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even if only men have a statistically significantly bigger dick than average youre forgetting that women prefer casual sex with the top of men or even top man if youre being generous but even then women arent seeing the below average penises often and certainly not many sub inch penises those men generally selfselect themselves out of the sexual marketplace so maybe shes saying that every other dick is above in some womens experience that may very well be true despite a lot of women being in the cock carousel just as many may have only fucked men in their life if youve only fucked and had large penises youd think that its at least somewhat common and how do you become a top man experience lots of experience flirting with lots of women from ideally a young age and if youve got a penis women are going to talk and its going to help you bet that experience early on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a good looking guy with an avg dick or an avg looker with a big one in all honesty whichever one could fuck better good dick game aint easy to find that being equal probably the goodlooking guy with an average dick i dont have an issue with the statement an average dick is adequate but i do have an issue with the idea that size doesnt matter at all because of course it does youre on the right track with weighting dick size against other smv factors
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why are you with him then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my vagina disagrees i have a semicolon
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just need more lube and foreplay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love me a inch fat cock hey bebe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love me a inch fat cock even then if someone came along with a cock ie cm smaller would you even know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even if it cant reach the cervix who really cares i dont think most women want their cervix to be pounded from what i hear as most find it painful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,turn off i liked the guy and didnt leave him because i didnt want to be mean but the whole experience was not the best for me every time we did something it was mildly unpleasant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,porn affects men yes women watch it i watch it but at much lower levels then your average guy my point is this if you ask the average women she will explain to you that dick size is if a factor at all a very small one somewhere around eye color or the specific type of car a man drives ive seen it said by women over and over and over why wont men believe us what would be our motivation for lying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,huh interesting hypothesis im not sure i agree but at least its a compelling idea instead of just women even anonymous women on the internet who have nothing to gain are lying to us about dicks for no reason at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eh just repeating what my gf said on the matter
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,many women dont cum from just penis in vagina sex so yeah too long is a terrible thing we are dry and tired and some guy is just pounding away on us and not in the area that will actually lead to orgasm for many women so yeah almost no woman wants steady vaginal penetration for over minutes too long is as much of a bummer as too short
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ditto when i was active it was rare for me to finish in less than minutes sometimes not at all i used to wish that i had the minute man problem it can get really boring once you hit the minute mark
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im packing like inches and have heard the same shit it seems to be less about the physical measurement and more about how she feels about you so much this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it seems to be less about the physical measurement and more about how she feels about you true
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women just say that shit to flatter men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when did you measure me i dont recall
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really there was a blight punk kid when i was but that was not ashmconsensual as it could have been otherwise white meat exclusively i dont even like swarthy white men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,out of billion besides dudes that are huge arent going to be lining up for one of these studies let alone come across the come and get your cock measured signs lol penis size matters otherwise sexshops would sell bulk units under which they dont the bulk sale units are
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you keep using that statistic like its absolute but the thing is its a worldwide study it doesnt apply everywhere you should think in terms of local average rather than world average because the inch world average will be huge in most of asia average in north america and below average in europe in my country the average is inch so regardless of how few men supposedly have a inch penis theyre going to be considered average here not above average and while searching for a seriously big dick might be frustrating on a world wide scale its probably only going to take one or two guys in congo with a average tldr the world average doesnt really apply to the datinghookup scene which is still mostly local edit obnoxious typos
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there may be some racial variance but it is minimal there isnt much difference between the averages but the standard variations are different there are barely any asian penises over in length but thats like a third of all nonasians they dont have the big cock gene if it even exists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i must admit if some guys having a go at me even if its banter im always ready to say to them at least i can see my own penis without using a mirror that usually shuts them up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dude women dont give a fuck a shit about porn why do you think dudes in porn have huge dicks have you seen porn from the and most of the dudes have average dicks nowadays you see plenty of ugly af dudes doing porn with huge dicks thats what women want these days huge dicks accompanied by chad looks but thats beside the point lets give chad a rest right now porn is aimed at men and consumed by men i dont know about you bro but im not gay im not interested in looking at a dudes footlong dick that could be confused for the underground railroad lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh make no mistake its warped womens minds too there are plenty of stories reported by men who hookup with a woman and later when the clothes come off she laughs at his dick because its small women watch porn as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most porn dicks arent even that much bigger than average camera angles tiny girls camera tricks the fact that they barely go inside the girl etc all make them seem much bigger than they are granted there are some monstrous looking ones but if you actually look clearly you can see that most dont exceed eight inches
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really how many women have you had sex with who have expressed any such desire
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if size truly didnt matter then all other factors being equal in two man a woman would be just as likely to pick the one with the small dick as the one with a large dick im saying that if women were presented with the two options most would take the one with the larger penis assuming it doesnt exceed the maximum threshold for acceptable penis size no youre completely wrong penis size is so low on the priorities of the average woman that it wouldnt even be part of the equation and youre looking at things in a rather crude way if you believe that all other factors in two hypothetical men could be completely equal with absolutely no room for divergence between the two its much like the belief that many rpers have that women go for muscular men therefore the more muscular you are the better it is women do not assess men in this way you are thinking like a man and you are skiing well and truly offpiste if you believe this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so few guys have any dick game so much yes with this and honestly guys with larger penises tend to be lazy af
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what a stupid question for reasons other than his dick obviously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that doesnt change how deep a girl is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well we have to do enough of that just to get anywhere in the first place theres only so much you can do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope my first boyfriend was probably inches self described and observed he had no problems with sex with me it was enjoyable and he was by no means a chad i just had to close my eyes lol for context i had very low self esteem at and no male friends and my best friend convinced me to get my feet wet with the first guy to show any interest in mewho was someone i was physically disgusted bybut vaginas cant really tell the difference
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not pounded but the occasional tap is a good move ime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,depends on the woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,porn affects men yes women watch it i watch it but at much lower levels then your average guy will you go and who claims women watch porn more than men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most women are not known for sterling honesty on matters sexual relational or pertaining to their attraction to men in fact most women are known to out and out lie about all of these things if they conclude lying is in their best interests
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my point is this if you ask the average women she will explain to you that dick size is if a factor at all a very small one why would we trust what women say women are the gender that says chad looks is not all that important lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,weight height thigh gaps makeup hair eyebrows etc but my point was that everyone regardless of gender cares about stupid shit every now and then despite all the reasons not to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,deleted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah dont worry im not fit enough to last for hours
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh i really envy guys who can finish quickly like i could when i was my friend has seen hookers we have a pretty open relationship and he told me that he can ejaculate twice in minutes that is just unimaginable to me on one level its great that you can really give a woman a proper fucking every single time but sometimes i end up just as fucked as she is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed i last forever unless im getting head
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep sometimes we mean it sometimes we dont
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was able to come up with an exact measurement just by looking at it which is a common skill if the comments in this thread are to be believed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought you meant being a doctor or something what do you mean by swarthy do you like tjem blond or you dont like olive skin with hairy chests
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,out of billion besides dudes that are huge arent going to be lining up for one of these studies let alone come across the come and get your cock measured signs lol surely the opposite is the case surely guys who are small are less likely to participate in such a survey
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all of those selfreported averages are completely worthless
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how many brown wieners do you come into contact with on a regular basis
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is it also true that asians dont have the small cock gene then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no fatter women need bigger penises to be able to feel them their flesh gets in the way of the full length if the woman is fat stay outside and only a few get in so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a fat contortionist is still fat dude
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i kind of wonder about that even at my fattest which was considerable ive always been able to see it when looking down so i was either never as fat as i thought or better hung than i thought
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,true story my brother was sent to the principals office in elementary school for saying something close to this to another kid on the playground 😂
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the big dicks are actually there for the guys theres studies on this you should google it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,these are stories repeated by other men it doesnt really happen in all my years on the planet ive never heard of a guy being rejected for a fiveinch dick how could we its mostly all we see you start rejecting fiveinch dicks you are going to run out of lovers pretty fast or end up stuck with a guy with no job personality or intellect and a magical seveninch penis
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i it seems very odd that you would conclude that porn has warped womens minds primarily considering women pay far far far less attention to porn than men ii virtually every man that virtually every woman comes into contact with will have a penis there is about a chance that youll be between or at least very close to these parameters so most women will not laugh at a guy with a penis if they do theyll be doing a lot of laughing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeeaaaah you just made that up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lot people are bad when it comes to measurements also you need to factor in girth as you can have a dick that is long but if it has girth it look bigger and from what i seen from women they more preferwant girth than length
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plenty of stories where dude
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or she just has had a bit of luck and picked several inchers before him considering that guys with big cocks have more sex on average and that they are getting passed around by women its not uncommon for them to have multiple big ones and start to think of the average as small
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh make no mistake its warped womens minds too there are plenty of stories reported by men who hookup with a woman and later when the clothes come off she laughs at his dick because its small this has happened to me hooked up with a former classmate she saw my inches and she laughed and said she had never had a guy that small before made me feel like i was a midget a dick midget dick so small i could use it to get a smalls firearms permit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe but they sure look ginormous to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,girls have expressed dissapointment over me not having a huge dick the more sexual partners a girl has the longer a dick they want the guy to have the girls i like are all like banged guys each theyre bound to come across dudes with big dicks and they get spoiled rotten hehehe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are thinking like a man and you are skiing well and truly offpiste if you believe this im pretty sure the poster youre responding to is a woman fwiw i think youre both right dick size isnt a massive issue unless its overtly small but a big dick is nice ive said this before on here but its as much psychological as it is physical at least for me the men ive been with have generally been average one was noticeably smaller and two noticeably much larger those big dicks are nice yeah theyre unwieldy but theres some weird mindthing that goes on there when a dude is big basically its very masculine primal a big dick emphasizes the difference between a man and a woman feminine vs masculine and to me anything that emphasizes that difference is fucking hot but the lack of a big dick is really not a thing its a bonus if its there a nice bonus but still a bonus not a necessity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no youre completely wrong penis size is so low on the priorities of the average woman that it wouldnt even be part of the equation you ever had women request you dick pics i have a friend who hands them out by womens request like hes working at the movies and selling popcorn except he gets nudes in return as payment for the dick pics lol women want and women love a big dick they claim they dont because they dont want to appear to be sluts and because society shames them also most guys have average dicks why would women want men to feel bad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you dont like sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just gotta work it in women are pushing out babies and sticking fists and shit in their cooch
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,glad you came through that teenage years are rarely pleasurable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really just curious are you a woman the sensation of anything hitting the cervix makes many women ill just curious if youre a girl who actually likes that feeling
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it does but from hearing from women and talking to some most dont want their cervix pounded due to the pain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,learned something new today
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one claimed more you claimed far far less which just isnt true either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and why would lying to strangers on reddit be in my best interest lying to my partner to spare his feelings sure but what would be my motivation and all these other womens motivation for trying to make strangers feel better about their dicks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then why hang out on here if youll never believe anything women say because they are all just liars making up shit dont hang on a debate sub its pointless
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men dont care about weight and attractiveness that does go against every single thing ive ever experienced my whole life long what do they care about now personality ha this sub argues against that all the time and dont say you want someone with a great body and natural beauty our weight and makeup is how we get there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ha okay that was funny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men already do ooo baby youre so tight etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hmmm did you see the pic where i actually measured it that might help you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my preferred coloration is sandy germanic like viggo mortenson and my husband i like anglo celt germanic scandinavian and slav skin tones no italians greek portuguese noneuropeans are out entirely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really a male who is small is more likely to get measured in a study to validate that they arent small a larger male would be just taking his personal experience as enough validation id hit up some anonymous white coat to measure me for a study if i was insecure if im hung then snapchat and a can of shaving cream will get me the oohs and ahhs i was seeking
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair enough but that doesnt change the fact that a world wide studys data shouldnt be applied to dating and hookups which happens mostly on a local scale because there can still be a significant difference between countries or the fact that the study only includes about measurements of participants erect penises and only gathered enough data to get an erect average in a handful countries which isnt enough to get a representative number on a world wide scale and i think my countrys average might still be a valid number unless my friends and i got lucky every time but i doubt that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some but its more like a human colored rainbow of cocks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol ive actually seen a full on spergy rant by a chubby chaser about this saying that any man who wont fuck fatties has a tiny dick had to find it haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never really thought about this i wont have sex with anyone fat i will never be fat so it just wont happen i dont mind a bit of meat on the bones in fact i favour this but not someone who is overweight
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly let alone some of the most enjoyable positions are not as feasible to do with a big girl mmm to be ridden by a girl and not have your hip bones crushed to dust by her weight would be heavenly i imagine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yet another reason to throw all the fat asses in concentration camps
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah it works every time it soon shuts them up ive always got it stored up in my brain for the unlikely event of my mums husband scoring any verbal points off me although in his case i can also point out that he didnt make a cup of tea until he was and my mum basically does everything for him short of wiping his arse which i think he does for himself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really guys want to see huge dongs railing a tiny girl lol damn men are weird
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that seems rather strange to me but hey more power to them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and marry him lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im only repeating what other men have said the cases are probably in the minority but they still happen from what ive heard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is a penis magical by itselfeven if its attached to an unappealing guy or the guy becomes attractive because he is packing heat i dont understand how this works
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,try visiting dating sites more focused on casual sex i promise you that you wont spend more than minutes browsing ads from women looking for men before you find absurd statements about how the only thing that is interesting is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,til i have a wand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,magical im pretty cool and have a job too i guess im a god damn unicorn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i it seems very odd that you would conclude that porn has warped womens minds primarily considering women pay far far far less attention to porn than men ive always wondered where people get this information that women dont watch porn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,considering women pay far far far less attention to porn than men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i it seems very odd that you would conclude that porn has warped womens minds primarily considering women pay far far far less attention to porn than men more than of women watch porn dude probably the is alot higher than that with young women ii virtually every man that virtually every woman comes into contact with will have a penis there is about a chance that youll be between or at least very close to these parameters so most women will not laugh at a guy with a penis if they do theyll be doing a lot of laughing lol no chads usually have longer thicker dicks since women all bang chads they are also going to grow accostumed to men with huge dicks so when they lower their standards to date men who arent chad they are going to be very sexually bored because the guy likely has an average dick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that and its soulcrushingly mean i would never intentionally laugh at a mans dick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would i make that up why would those men make that up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah im starting to think that girth is actually more important than length
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well cmon how many men irl are actually going to open up about something like that even among close friends men wont talk about how a woman rejected them over their penis i hear about these things mostly online uonclejulian just responded saying that it happened to him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah but so do the vaginas lol guys watching porn spend too much time looking at the dicks if you want a decent measure look at the girls hands to compare they get really small girls whose hands make the dicks look huge
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe youre actually smaller than inches then statistically if theyve banged guys at the most or of them have had a bigger dick than inches by any significant amount or maybe you have a thin dick i dont know still its a shitty thing to say you wouldnt complain about her boobs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre ignoring the bit i put in there about maximum upper limits for acceptable penis sizes its not just that women dont care if you have a penis or a penis or a penis if theyre really attracted to you they just dont this is not how women work women feel attracted to someone they dont look at a guy and think well hes alright but id prefer it if his penis was inches longer they dont care if you are excessively small thats unfortunate if you are excessively large then it can put some women off apart from that it will have zero impact on how attractive you are to women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its just under so many other things its like great feet for men or nice hands i guess maybe for some men it matters a little but no one is making decisions based on it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love sex we figure out ways to make us both cum that dont involve me being torn in half by a dick bigger than my forearm that doesnt feel good there are work arounds for tiny cocks there are work arounds for giant cocks just curious are you being deliberately dense or did you really not know that not all women have pornstar vaginas that can handle a coke can
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that works for some women yes not all of us have a canal deep enough for inches to feel good edit also pushing out a baby is incredibly painful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hi im one of those women who feels ill when cervixbumping happens p
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its good from what i remember i cant really say its happened in recent memory not really necessary though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok well speaking from experience lots of girls actually like it if you do it right especially if you get past the cervix theres a spot they really like
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the person i linked to did claim that women watch porn more than men all porn is aimed at men all erotica is aimed at men all of the sex industry is aimed at men any attempts to produce visual erotica aimed at women have completely failed we also know that women are significantly less visual than men and less likely to require visual aids in order to get turned on we also know that men get turned on more easily and more quickly than women and have higher sex drives generally i therefore conclude that men watch porn far far more than women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love tolkien doesnt mean i believe in elves oh then you look at some girls and you wonder if elves really do exist wrong example sorry its fun to read what blue pillers say and how much hamstering they provide
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you didnt read my second sentence are you saying that only men are irrational in their insecurities can you not empathize with that feeling a lot of people of both genders experience it all the time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not interested enough to go looking through all your posts you seem more invested in proving the size of your dick than your original post let on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,viggo is def swarthy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never seen italians as a different kind of skin but its probably people from south with thick curly hair as muacirclejerk would say im a pale princess snowflake and so was my family
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youd get your cock out in front of another man and let him measure it if you were concerned that you had a small penis what strange behaviour
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do black guys have bigger wieners than white guys and have you controlled for your own confirmation bias
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what a strange person people get so weird and emotional about things and feel so inclined to defend their preferences to others if you want to fuck fat chicks just do it i actually prefer women who are not without exception but i just get on better with them generally i prefer someone with a bit of maturity and worldliness and thats just more likely to be present in someone of this age group that doesnt mean that i dont look at some younger women and think theyre really fit nor does it mean that i wouldnt date a younger woman if we hit it off i know most guys dont feel this way but i dont feel diminished by this its just my personal preference
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wooow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if it happens once out of a thousands of encounters and other men repeat it because men are far more obsessed with the size of dicks than women will ever be does it really matter at all i once heard a story of a man who left is his girl because her butt was too small does that mean that is something worth concerning myself with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in real life youve actually heard men tell these stories
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women browsing casual sex dating sites is also a very selective and special audience
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,always remove a few inches wow that must be a foot long i had a cock last night it was he had a cock it was around chad has an incher chad is a bit above average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,from women who lie lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this data doesnt prove that women watch porn as much as men it proves that they take longer to masturbate which we already knew
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to reinforce the idea that modern western women have utterly impossible standards
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because by and large it is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am still trying to understand where you are getting plenty from most women people in general dont know what inches is people are terrible at judging sizes and distances i find it hard to believe in the heat of the moment when it gets to two people being physical that a woman will stop everything and laugh because of a guys size
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,indeed most guys are afraid of having their masculinity debated me i dont really give a fuck and i just say whatever crosses my mind at the time i have no problem saying when a girl rejects me for whatever reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah ive measured it also had girls measure it and its inches my dick has the thickness of middle fingers put together at the same time still its a shitty thing to say you wouldnt complain about her boobs yes i would dude i love big tits gimme all the d and double ds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre making the same argument to me over and over but youre still failing to prove that dick size doesnt matter you keep telling me women will overlook lessthan ideal dick size in favor of other factors i agree with that now prove that dick size doesnt matter at all care to address my point about the dildos
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women feel attracted to someone they dont look at a guy and think well hes alright but id prefer it if his penis was inches longer they dont care youre wrong to claim they simply dont care not making a specific thing youre top priority doesnt mean you dont care about it at all it means you care but its not the most important thing you care about its like you dont understand the difference between a hard condition for a relationship and a general preference just because youre willing to forgo a general preference doesnt mean it never existed or never mattered
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not just that women dont care if you have a penis or a penis or a penis if theyre really attracted to you they just dont i dont get it dude you are a man why do you talk about dick size as if you were a woman and had your set preferences for a given dick size lol the more attractive the woman is the more she wants a big dick do average women not mind an average size dick sure they are fat ugly they gotta take what they can get the rest of the women expect a man to have a big dick thats all that matters by the way dude if women dont care much about a mans dick size why do they all have dildos longer than africa
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but no one is making decisions based on it yes i agree with you it is pretty far down on the list of priorities as long as its not too small or too large
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you wish his dick was smaller
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,me too i wasnt trying to be rude id just never heard another woman say she enjoyed that feeling
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,me too that is strictly a nofly zone for me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or she is but due to angle and length you are hitting it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol wut so you are saying that girls vaginas are infinite length
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all porn is aimed at men all erotica is aimed at men all of the sex industry is aimed at men i dont look for porn aimed at women therefore it doesnt exist great logic bro i therefore conclude that men watch porn far far more than women you cant just make things up and assume that you are correct at least look at any stats pornhub themselves said that every third porn viewer is a woman which isnt that much less
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my point is that you are comparing apples and oranges very few women out there give a shit about dick size therefore a male worrying about it is irrational on the other hand most of male attraction is based on beauty so its not really irrational for us to worry about that at all its logical i dont have any irrational insecurities in women these would be something like worrying because youre a bcup not a ccup so no i cant empathize
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont really care what you do in your sex life im just telling you what happens of course people say all sorts of flattering little nothings during sex a person would have to be dumb or naive to take any of it as truth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i proved it with several pics last year im not interested in anything beyond that rp guys love to talk shit about bp men so i posted pics of myself to show them who i really am since they always called me a liar you are of that same pathetic group my posts show exactly who i am and the response to those posts substantiates everything else if you want to disbelieve facts that is your fucking problem you seem interested in taking cheap shots at people with petty arguments go be petty somewhere else
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he is not swarthy he is sandy and golden sicilians are swarthy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure be better that than getting laughed at like i said an insecure male will whip it out for a study where size doesnt matter boat on the ocean type placatives are thrown around but being hung and already knowing it due to every female looking at it with a look of you want to try to put that where you arent going to bother signing up for a study kinda like women and men being truthful about preferences in a study a dude might say sure ill do an overweight woman because of trying to come off nice meanwhile with his mates the truth of hell no will come out without hesitation end of the day people have preferences and penis size falls under that so does weight age skin colour and everything else you can be called an ist ism or phobe for liking or not liking penis size matters edit fear of getting your dick out in front of another man may be a sign of having a very popular phobe careful your lefty friends over at tbp wont like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great fuck thank you yay that people have preferences weight age penis size whatever but if a guy wont stfu about how small or incompetent he thinks his dick is then its a huge turn off i didnt give a flip until you just droned in for ten minutes about your dick size actually the same can be said for guys with bigger dicks too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre right men shouldnt fret over it too much but for a lot of selfconscious guys it only takes hearing a few of those stores or worse having it happen to themselves for them to firmly believe that women want big dicks and they cant measure up maybe if there was more professional porn that featured actual normal sized dicks it would help dissolve the misperception that a normal penis is supposed to look like an snake with the girth of a soda can
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nahhh because unless your chasing chad said hypothetical guy wont get whatn he wants anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ya it does it says nothing about masturbating
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a third of every pornhub visitor is a woman is that really paying that much less attention to porn than men considering that women also read more erotic novels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it says nothing about masturbation lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im only repeating to you what others have said if youre deliberately choosing not to believe it because it paints women in a negative light then thats how you youre intoxicated off of the women are wonderful effect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i find it hard to believe in the heat of the moment when it gets to two people being physical that a woman will stop everything and laugh because of a guys size theres that women are wonderful effect again no one wants to believe that women can that maliciously cruel to a guy but they most definitely can be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant prove it other than telling you and several women on this thread also telling you if thats not enough evidence please feel free to retain your existing beliefs i must confess that im not an authority on dildos but my observation would be that most dildos are much bigger than virtually all penises and thus women must feel comfortable with using them as theyre able to control the penetration as many women actively dont want massive penises as they can be painful etc if youre overly concerned with this why dont you start a thread on the subject or go to askwomen and ask some actual women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,okay its no more important than a woman saying i like blue eyes i would say its less important than that do guys obsess about the colour of their eyes no the focus on penis size is utterly irrational
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really i dont care about dick size thats my point penis size isnt really important hes great the way he is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the vast vast majority of porn is aimed at men attempts to sell porn to women have failed or end up being consumed mostly by gay men remember playgirl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,obviously pornhubs statements should be taken seriously its not as if theyd want to put the porn industry in a positive light is a video from pornhub that i picked completely at random it was just trending on the front page in the uk this video has comments there are tonnes of comments such as dem tiddies on that white girl are beautiful anyone know her name this black girl so perfect this is my dream to be with black girl like this naked in sauna wow great video she is gorgeous show me the comments from women in the comments section talking about how attractive the man is for that matter show me any video on pornhub ill make it easy for you that features a lot of comments from women good fucking luck finding it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah i see if you have no relatable experience than it can be difficult to understand but i also think it is common for men and women to be irrationally insecure about more typical sources of attraction like weight or height rather than just about petty things like penis and breast size
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think all this pill stuff in nonsense i just find it interesting that someone who thinks so well of themself and made a post about why guys shouldnt care about penis size would be so determined to prove that he was bigger than he actually was if are the photos youre referring to then it just proves what i already said since you are clearly starting your measurement from the first inch of the tape measure inches is a more accurate measurement edit i wanted to add that for someone who calls himself a blue pill man you certainly like to utilize a lot of red pill lingo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes aragorn still looks wasp and can get into a country club in the btw unless someone is really stereotypical looking how can u tell if they are italian or not thats just a stereotype
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not homophobic my brother is gay but i wouldnt be overly keen on a man measuring my penis
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe if there was more professional porn that featured actual normal sized dicks it would help dissolve the misperception that a normal penis is supposed to look like an snake with the girth of a soda can dont watch porn if its warping your mind dont watch it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all it shows is that women spend more time per visit at porn sites than men assuming we accept that data as being accurate it doesnt tell us how often they visit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my disbelief has nothing to do with what light it paints women in you asked me why men would make up such stories and i believe their motivations would be just that the reason why i dont believe the stories is that this would mean those girls laugh at the penises of most or something was it or all men they have sex with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women can be cruel of couse they can but how often do you think this happens plenty stopping mid ripping clothes off to laugh at a guy is both boner killing and vagina drying most women will never have anything above average in their lives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if youre overly concerned with this why dont you start a thread on the subject or go to askwomen and ask some actual women what you realize im a woman right im not overly concerned you started a debate op and we are currently having a debate feel free to tap out if youre not into it my point with dildos is this theyre literally dicks that women can pick and choose if size didnt matter then why would women have different preferences why would one woman buy a dildo while another one buys a dildo as many women actively dont want massive penises as they can be painful etc yes so you do agree that size matters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i must confess that im not an authority on dildos but my observation would be that most dildos are much bigger than virtually all penises and thus women must feel comfortable with using them as theyre able to control the penetration as many women actively dont want massive penises as they can be painful etc hahaha i never thought id see the day id witness a man hamstering away something women have huge dildos because thats what women love big dicks if youre overly concerned with this why dont you start a thread on the subject or go to askwomen and ask some actual women you think the women on askwomen or anywhere else are going to be honest about this subject
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant prove it other than telling you and several women on this thread also telling you if thats not enough evidence please feel free to retain your existing beliefs why is penis size the factor where we should trust what women say publicly when we are told that women saying that they want a nice guy is just saying what they are expected to say my personal belief is that it is a coverup if women were honest with what they wanted all their whining about how female models make them feel bad would lose all moral justification
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,focussing on half inch differences between adequate sized penises is irrational is perfectly fine if the woman isnt obese
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you actually arguing right now that dick size is less important than eye color why on what basis are you making that claim i have never seen anything to corroborate this in reality this is a pretty idealistic claim but its not realistic in the slightest not to mention that eye color serves no functional purpose it doesnt benefit me in any way to date a man with brown eyes over a man with blue but i do literally physically experience a benefit by dating a guy who has a penis over a guy with a penis focus is the wrong word because it again implies priority and we already established that its not a priority its merely a preference i wouldnt reject a guy with a penis on the basis of his dick length alone but obviously a penis simply feels better assuming both of these men are also good in bed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes exactly its not like it doesnt count at all it sort of counts but in my experience having that one girlfriend who insists on seveninch cocks is like having a girlfriend who insists all her boyfriends drive bmws yeah i guess those people exist but they arent of women out there and are pretty rare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sooo you like sex are with a guy who you claim is so big that you have to find ways to work around it to have enjoyable sex yet at the same time his penis isnt too big so then are you having great sex in spite of his big penis
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok and what do you call it when the dick hits that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,obviously pornhubs statements should be taken seriously its not as if theyd want to put the porn industry in a positive light great logic pornhub and google adsense are lying your gut feel is objective truth show me the comments from women in the comments section talking about how attractive the man is why should only women talk about the man or why should the be only talking about the man for all we know the this is my dream to be with a black girl in a sauna could be a woman as well also why this video and not one of the genresporn stars that women enjoy the most open a mandingo and james deen video for example and look again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right im saying dudes do talk like that and no one takes it seriously everyone understands its just dirty talk shit people say in the moment because it gets themtheir partner going youre so bighard or youre so wettight are the same that way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course hes sandy germanic not swarthy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not saying its warping my mind im totally capable of watching porn while knowing that what those guys are packing is not what an average penis looks like i cant say the same for other people who watch porn though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,porn is my only sexual outlet lol masturbation without porn is boring
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,assuming we accept that data as being accurate pornhub has no reason to lie
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that would still mean they are watching more porn than the men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pornhub shows that women watch more porn than men do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a guy telling a woman that women dont care about dick size lol ive seen it all now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why are there and dildos available that presumably sell well when virtually no man in the world possesses a penis of this size many women would be scared shitless if they saw a cock of this size and a significant percentage cannot accommodate a penis of this size why are most dildos far bigger than when of men have a smaller penis than this please enlighten me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,okay dont believe them then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which more and more women are becoming
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not only wouldnt you reject him you wouldnt even know his penis size until you slept with him however only of men have penises in excess of when youre getting up to above then youre talking about a very small category women are not going to seek out guys with a penis because they barely exist statistically and you cant find out how big his cock is until you fuck him so youd have to fuck dozens of guys to find the guy with a penis also if youre with someone and everything is great youre not going to dump him because he has a penis and you said you wouldnt reject someone because they have a penis so it just means nothing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure ive been with guys that were too small guys that had natural body odor i didnt like so much even when clean guys who were short but girthy guys that were long and too skinny my point is no one is making mate choices based on what your dick looks like i dont spend a lot of time thinking about it no guy has a perfect cock so its irrelevant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also why this video and not one of the genresporn stars that women enjoy the most open a mandingo and james deen video for example and look again show me one in which there is anything other than a majority of men commenting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,woman ooh fuck me hard daddy this guy what a ridiculous thing to say im not your dad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats good well they should stop watching porn i did mention this in the op
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would men stop watching porn dude whats a guy to do without porn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or they could just get their heads out of their asses educate themselves and realize that what they see in porn is nowhere near the average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,punching up vs punching down completely ignores the fact that status is situational more importantly situational status is way more important than the status of your group at large a group of black lawyers kicking a homeless white guy the situational status is obviously more important hes weak theyre cunts a group of black homeless guys mugging an emaciated white lawyer hes weak they are cunts where we stand in the progressive stack is absolutely irrelevant to of our daytoday activities of course thats exactly what its designed to do its designed to allow sjws to create micro situations where they can bully people with impunity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont expect people you disagree with to respond to this post in good faith when you begin by flinging insults like sjw at them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i really dont understand the questionstatement punching down is just a matter of who is the assumed underdog in our society we assume the underdog to be certain people and the authorityman to be certain other people not seeing the relative privation there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the text is that question isnt it a completely logically fallacious idea of thats its punching up at white males in humor while punching down would be a white male making a joke about any other group it could be that i would say that its more a matter of hypocrisy if one believes that its wrong to attack entire groups of people based on immutable conditions of birth its on this point that the entire civil rights movement started going awry there were those who simply wanted justice equality freedom and were happy enough with that then there were others who wanted to use the civil rights movement as a vehicle for revenge and retaliation against an entire group of people most of whom arewere innocent of any wrongdoing at some point in the or early the latter group of people started to take greater prevalence in the civil rights and social justice movements it was also the same time when african american studies and womens studies started becoming more and more prevalent on campuses the trouble with their way of thinking is not because theyre picking on those poor white males or that theyre somehow hurting our feelings its not that big a deal from that standpoint but the real trouble is that theyre indirectly giving moral license to the practice of judging entire groups of people by race andor gender the whole idea of judge people as individuals not by the group they were born into flies right out the window when you hear this white male talk coming from the sjw crowd and with so many people voluntarily segregating themselves if not physically then ideologically the idea of judging by the group didnt seem as bad anymore if there can be such a thing as black studies or womens studies then we see entire academic disciplines and cottage industries being created simply by judging people by the group after all the sjws are showing us that sometimes its okay to judge people by the group into which they were born if thats the case then its simply a matter of expanding the instances and situations where its considered okay to do so theyve opened up the debate to this and that may be why a lot of white males are falling out of line and dont feel as inhibited as they once did in effect the sjws have conceded whatever moral high ground they once held instead of making it an issue of justice civil rights or equality theyve turned it into a us vs them situation by wavering from their original goals and ideals
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would you even engage with sjws
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whats wrong with barracking for the underdog
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not that simple you can punch up at millionaires and billionaires and the government as a white male or at coastal elites if you are a working class white male and you can definitely punch up at chad and stacy lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the concept of punching updown is the sjw equivalent of white people trying to use science to prove that white people really are smarter than black people it comes from the place of starting with a conclusion and then backtracking to find or come up with some evidence that proves the conclusion in this case the conclusion is that it is okay to insult white guys over racegender but its wrong for white guys to insult others over racegender
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a group of black lawyers kicking a homeless white guy the situational status is obviously more important how many comedy clubs are filled with black lawyers kicking homeless white men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was going to put social justice crowd but the the title became too big
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,scenario s is presented scenario b is presented as a bestcase therefore scenario s is not that good scenario s is presented scenario b is presented as a worstcase therefore scenario s is very good really youre not seeing it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,again relative privation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its hypothetical but i think the closest real world example in comedy is sjws claiming that charlie hebdo employees who were shot by terrorists were punching down
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then just say sj ive seen that term used a lot in noninsulting ways
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i think this is a very good example
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shit like this makes me miss the old days of trp before it was overrun by alt right tradcons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women are generally incapable of taking their commitments seriously especially marriages in this feminist infected landscape the person you quoted is under the delusion that marriage is something worth participating in or saving
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they have no confidence in their ability to attract women they want to force them to stay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lot of them have codependency issues and cant survive without mommys approval so they need to control their women so they dont hypergamy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they dont believe that women can control themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do some people want to control anything we want to be able to control where we live what we eat what we do for fun what we do for work what we drive who we hang out it who we date what we get out of friendships what we get out of relationships i suspect most people want to be able to control their lives and the things in their lives at least to some degree this certainly isnt only applicable to trp personally i dont want to control women or any one woman itd be tiring stressful boring and ultimately undesirable id prefer and id assume most trp and most people in general prefer to have someone that wants to do the things they want without having to control or make it happen i think it took a lot of men or years to realize that this ideal of a solid family unit and lifelong commitment is just that an ideal it can really destroy ones ego to have your view of the world hopes and dreams crushed and to realize generally no one gives a damn about you or your feelings if a man literally wants to control a woman how she acts how she dresses what she can and cant do who she can talk to etc then something is wrong with their ego or that have control issues if a man spends his whole life working his ass off to take care of his family raising his kids buying a house developing a family and social support network just for everything to be taken away when his wife falls for a coworker because she wasnt getting enough attention i could understand why someone felt they had no control but that post you quoted didnt touch any depth and wasnt really well thought out more just incoherent rambling from the snippet you quoted it certainly doesnt read like it was written from someone well versed in trp theory or in practice trp teaches to be the man you want to be and if somethingsomeone isnt meeting your needs then move on life is too short and too precious to focus on a woman who doesnt offer what you need or want if one is focusing on a mate that wants to cheat that wants to leave that wants to take half your shit in divorce that doesnt live up to their word who isnt honest or loyal and is just whining about lack of control then id say they arent well versed in trp and certainly not maintaining trp principles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theredpill is a help group and hate cult for men primarily who did not receive masculinity conditioning when younger and now fail horribly with women ie otherwise known as incels to be honest most of them would fail anyway womens standards would just increase so its neither here nor there but im trying to be complete in my thinking whilst some of them do become successful and i have no doubt trp works for some of these men the question is pretty silly in the context of the dynamic at play why would a group of people rejected by another group of people sometimes abusively so not wish to control the actions or minds of others hell i have enough frustration at my roommate who doesnt pay his half of our cable bill on time why wouldnt i want to subjugate the people who thought i was trash for years and never gave me the time of day womans sexual revolution is the single worst thing to happen to men as a group since world war ii
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,control as in sexual fidelity financial decisions etc i guess all relationships have some restrictions on behavior the redpill is saying those restrictions are being eroded and therefore you can not rely on your relationship partner as much
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because men dont want to get stuck raising some other guys kids this isnt just human behavior but most males found in nature try to ensure their genes get passed on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because they have major ego issues they wanna get back at mommy too by controlling the next generation of women they see themselves as entitled to control because of their penis some try to justify it because were supposedly childlike but if you ask me being too adult is boring i like fun and whimsy and creativity it doesnt mean i deserve fewer rights it just means ill never destroy the inner child within my brain it will come in handy if i ever get a baby or small child if im old and alone ill adopt one baby and one year old
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what does all this talk of controlling women have to do with selfimprovement control is power and increasing ones power is at the heart of self improvement its almost retarded how many people intentionally fail to grasp this truth its like they think they can improve in a vacuum nope unless youre increasing in power relative to those around you you havent done shit and unless you can exercise control over others you have no real power i guess theres this blue pill belief out there that a real man only improves by letting others do whatever the fuck they want it bears little resemblence to reality though the most selfimproved men in history were power hungry almost crazed over control im talking about those that went from relatives nobodies to kings the napoleons the genghis khans just straight up capturing and what would today be called raping women was the rule among manly men at one point but in these diseased degenerate times people will call you controlling and insecure for even applying dread game in other words this is all just another silly shaming attempt which ill continue to ignore its the same logic as why arent you polyamorous and letting your wife cuck you with other males monogamy is so controlling if you were really secure in your manhood youd let her do whatevz
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you have a woman committed to being with you dedicated to pleasing you sleeping with only you and making plans about her future revolving around you then that is this form of control we call attraction so yeah of course trp wants to control women because they want women to be attracted to them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,comment found on rtheredpill at really the sub has over members over of these are reading the sub right now its really really easy to find posts that are over over or over on bigger threads you can even find comments at these are the comments that are representative of trp as a whole not comments that could easily have just one or two actual upvotes and a bit of vote fuzzing youre cherrypicking simple as that and why did you not link to the context of this comment its kind of fishy that youre giving us an edited comment with zero context and then when i copy and paste the text into google the only exact result is this thread nothing from trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because if women are allowed to have unrestricted sexuality they destroy society with their poor decision making skills
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,with language like why do you need so badly to control us im understanding this as a question for rpers and tagging it accordingly all toplevel responses should be from rpers others can reply to automod
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because theyre destructive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some of them are literally jaded and confused personally i see their means to control as giving up perusing a healthy relationship because for them its too complicated overall id say it does reflect mor eon them than the world around them but i do feel sorry for the ones that have been abused
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that post genuinely surprised me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a solid post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you obviously are not a parent nor a dog owner lol but being in control is not the same as being controlling
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this was reported as responding to a while not being rp but i clarified it with the poster of the thread and they wanted the thread tagged as discussion rather than
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thread
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so women should drop any foolish notions of sexual satisfaction or happiness and just treat marriage like a shitty job and pray for their husband to die
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you should put your money where your mouth is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wish it wasnt true but i cant change anything about it this doesnt help you support classes are better off alone than tanks by design and making infidelity punishable means men cant cheat either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,saved
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this comment made me feel sick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,at least finally a red piller who says women are inferior
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think more long term than most men do actually im willing to let today go to chaos and hell for a better tomorrow end results are all i see if the good of society says i shouldnt have any control over my life despite being smarter than most men then fuck society im vetting for my own interests
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,womans sexual revolution is the single worst thing to happen to men as a group since world war ii are you being serious sexual revolution is what lets me get my dick wet without having to get married first i dont understand how this is a losing situation for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so this comes from a lack of understanding that women are people with their own problems heartbreaks and desires they dont get this and feel their needs supersede those of women and women should suffer as a group to alleviate their suffering
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hate cult
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,were fucked were cucked this should be their new subreddit slogan there could even be shirts and hats but in regard to the op it seems to be at least one of three things if not a mix they dont think theyre good enough for women to voluntarily sleep with them they actually arent good enough for women to voluntarily want to sleep with them they have a skewed view of women and themselves and therefore believe that they are owed things which they are not i get the frustration associated with but it will never excuse the hatred that has consumed trpers and their subreddits
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bc women dont want to have sex with them and the only way they can have it happen the way they want is to control women good lucky buddy pandoras box has been opened and we know your true colours now viva la feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never been in any situation where ive felt like man i really wish i had better control over my husband i have however been in situations in previous shittier relationships where i wished i had better control over my exs where i wished i could force them to stop sleeping around to stop disrespecting me i really think that if you feel like your partner needs to be controlled in order to maintain harmony in your relationship then its a shitty relationship not worth holding on to maybe youre the problem maybe they are most likely its just a fundamental lack of compatibility good relationships dont feel like power struggles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,kind of like a slave then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would like to hear from everyone so if you allow discussion flair i will edit that part
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,standard among who though the mods founders and old school posters who arent doing anything to shut down all the altright control your woman shitposters glo whos doing everything he can to profit from all the rageporn hes posting trp has gone to shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i own two dogs and i know what you mean about being in control vs being controlling i dont know exactly what the guy quoted in the op meant but given the context it sounds more like the latter
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,seems like a good way to get poisoned
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only good thing about them believing our inferiority is it makes it much easier for an intelligent woman to trick them you can literally get away with anything if nobody thinks youre capable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you do not represent men you getting your dick wet does not represent the wants or needs of other men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no im saying it comes from the fact that women are a source of pain and suffering and people suffering typically seek to control the source of their suffering if you have a splinter in your foot you pull it out it also has a lot to do with revenge women fucked them so they wanna fuck over women its not about one persons needs superceding anothers its that women lost their right to be treated with altruistic respect when they treated said trp man like shit so why would this trp man treat women well in return when he digs himself out and finally becomes desirable that being said most trp do not believe women suffer or at least suffering to women is more like a minor inconvenience the lives of the modern western woman are pretty stellar compared to the modern western omegabeta male
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your post has a flaw in that it ignores the content of a threads related comments
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what a lazy straw man just call trp literally hitler and be done with it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure how you got space out of what i wrote can you elaborate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure ill change it now and reapprove the posts that were removed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or replaced by a washing machine my grandfather apparently had a fear of washing machines despite having six children he maintained that no wife of mine will ever own a washing machine he was right she didnt get one while he was alive she bought one the day after he died got a job as a waitress working hours a week and never remarried says a lot about the state of their marriage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except that by your own account you have a gf and plates on the side does your gf not keep herself pretty and put out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not the real world thats some fantasy in your head wanting to tell people how to live their life is a very bizarre fantasy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yea that too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure but i fail to see how not having to fucking get married just to have sex is a bad thing for any dudes anywhere and before you cry but what about teh incels we all know those bros wouldnt be getting laid presexual revolution either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,revenge womens suffering a minor inconvenience women dont really suffer a few women out of all women treated them badly therefore all women are to blame none of that sounds like the logic of a sound and stable mind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not gonna suffer from your revenge or anyones revenge for their misperceptions about me im ready for combat mode against anyone who does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a threads comments are what i analyzed my inability to readscore all comments in a thread is not a flaw provided i objectively sampled a reasonable number of them which i did
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the sense that slaves didnt get control over their own lives and not wanting women to have control over their sex lives or finances is the same its ok for men to have control over their sex lives and finances but women need to be pent up and controlled like shes property and not a full person
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thank mr skeltal mod
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah the good old days when all marriages were bliss
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah she should have a much harder time because the man is insecure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not having to get married to get sex is only of value for men who have the power of choice to a attract women for casual sex and b pick women of their choosing for commitment both of which are not qualities most men share in common its not about incels youre right incels would never succeed anyway its about math and satisfaction all men getting say or options and marrying one is better for all men than a swath of men having options and a couple guys having attractive men would still get attractive women the issue is that sexual revolution has caused midtier women to go nuts with hypergamy and demand men out of their league and because any given woman can fuck pretty much anything she pleases they think they can actually get these apex males and that really screws up everything so the current dynamic is pretty awful for men unless you happen to be a in the age of tinder having a penis is a pretty bad deal the age of the white picket fence not as much
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sex is evil it causes greed further down the line we were born to like it but it causes a pattern of greed for everyone greed jealousy or whatever you call it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre not really making an argument youre more just ignoring another persons paradigm because its inconvenient to your own revenge is a pretty basic human emotion mating is peoples primary goal in life tell someone indirectly or directly that they are too unattractive to have their affections reciprocated and bad things are generally going to happen as for the other points youd have to make an actual argument instead of just feeling at me that theyre not logically sound everything is logical to someone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what kind of combat mode
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you analyzed threads and every comment within each individual thread
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all relationships have rules and restrictions for either gender your making a hysterical and ridiculous comparison to slavery thats totally inaccurate a woman can leave a relationship at any time a slave cannot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh you read absolute control im not sure what to say if youre seeing things that arent there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well both parties are supposed to give up certain aspects of control when then enter a relationship it can be as mild as not always getting to pick the movie you watch together to the standard sexual exclusivity rule that most relationships have and in more committed relationships you the more control you have to give up over yourself discuss major changes in finances with your partner where you live how many kids you will have and how you will raise them this is naturally how relationships work however the men of rp feel that women arent giving up any of their control to meet him halfway though i wont deny there are some men that expect the woman to meet him all the way which is equally unreasonable its not slavery to expect a certain amount of surrender to your partner thats harmony
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men do not have control over their finances paying taxes without consenting to paying them is slavery so too is paying child support without consent ask yourself why women are so keen to use proxy violence the government to remove mens money to hand over to women thats control and its control that is largely supported by women and most men if you think men and women are full people and not property you would support abolishing child support alimony and taxes in general
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my country is gonna fail because women are allowed the same freedom and rights as men not because of global warming or wars or energy shortage just because of women being free to be who they are you cannot be serious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh goodness haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really i plan to live the life of my dreams and have it all if other people fall because theyre idiots its on them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,seriously bro you may as well say food is evil if sex is so evil why not just chemically castrate yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres a detailed explanation of exactly what i did if you skim to the methodology header i analyzed total comments the top comments from the top posts from the last month on trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,slaves were treated this way because they werent seen as full human beings but as lesser if you think women shouldnt have control over their own finances and sex lives it isnt seeing them as lesser in the same manner as a slave furthermore why should men get that control over women what makes them fit to be the ones in charge of someone elses life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if both partners are giving up some freedom and control for the relationship ok but one man wanting complete control over the womans finances and whether she can leave the relationship or not is insane thats treating her like his property
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when he says my country is gonna fail he means his dick will be less satisfied and lets be real this guy isnt getting laid anyway in his head this counts as a massive crisis its on par with global warming wwiii and energy shortages welcome to men being logical and stoic on the internet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,every relationship has some degree of control in it relationships with anyone carry an element of a restriction on behavior youre trying argue a binary and its a little silly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its hysterical to read complete control from the comment saying having no control heres a reality check women also have control over men in marriages men need to fulfill certain roles in order to get sex or love from their wives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you do or you dont believe men should control womens finances and ability to leave a relationship
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id love to answer your question but it appears youre setting a strawman no one is saying absolute control
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uheathcliff made it so we dont have to make a strawman his whole post was so ridiculous that it makes a strawman of itself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so these are my views as briefly as i can express them i i do believe mens issues are marginalised or often ignored completely for example it was recently widely reported in the uk media that the level of young female suicide had increased for the second year in succession it was barely mentioned that young male suicides were still over higher this is despite the fact that womens issues and the problems that women face are continually highlighted in the media hardly ever are any issues facing men even discussed symptomatic of this is the fact that the filmmaker assumed that all of the mras would be completely pathetic i see this assumption on here all the time if men fail in any way at all its because theyre weak or inadequate or incompetent or a combination of the three no man is ever allowed to underachieve due to circumstances it simply must be due to their own failings thats why so many young men commit suicide because they feel like failures and they have nowhere to turn because society tells them that its not okay to fail as a man and definitely dont expect any sympathy or empathy ii i agree with some mra arguments but they undermine their position by a promoting weak or completely flawed arguments b exaggerating their good arguments c too frequently tying dating and sex into the movement d making claims about feminism and its impact on society that are poorly founded or just plain ridiculous iii both feminists and mras are guilty of tunnelvision neither group can see that perhaps society is tough for both men and women and that it doesnt automatically follow that if life is tough for women that it must be easy for men or viceversa life isnt a zerosum game in which one gender wins and the other one loses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wonder is there a feminist whos looked deeply into mens issues and hasnt come away believing that theyre real and serious theres this and theres self made man by norah vincent it seems like whenever people consider this stuff with an open mind they come away with hey they have a point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mra is leftist and similar to feminism in that it seek left style social justice legal activism and crybabying its not surprising a feminist would be in line with it the mens rights movement was started by the womens right movement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if she thinks that men like elam are advocating for men rather than using mens issues to line their pockets then shes pretty gullible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminists are antimra because they want to hog all societal resources for themselves and conceding that mens issues need those resources as well is blasphemy to them they dont care for rights like legal paternal surrender shared custody or stricter access to alimony they only blather about men being capable of showing emotions when women are the first ones with a low tolerance for emotional and weak men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,interesting its good to see a more friendly nonheated interaction between feminists and the mens rights movement although im opposed to both of them its better than having someone get punched at a protest
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my problem with mras is they always blame feminism as the cause of mens issues rather than realize that its part of the same sexual inequality that oppresses women mens issues and womens issues are two sides of the same coin edit andor some kind of hierarchy where women have more power
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its weird that this documentary was made before trump won the election i feel that for a while there it seemed to me that feminism was the dominant political force in society especially if you were on a college campus now i imagine that feminists and the left in generali am a bernie bro are much less sure of themselves and their previously assumed arch of history
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my issue with both movements is the lunatic fringe from mras saying theyll never pass a guilty verdict on any rape no matter the evidence to feminists like susan moore who seem to flip flop between saying men need to treat all women as equals and then labelling women that didnt vote the way she wanted them to as uneducated and scared tools of the patriarchy source pretty much saying that women need to vote how they tell them to and if you dont youre too dumb to have freedom of choice thereby undermining everything the first wave fought for theres a sensible message in both sides as cassie jaye found out and we are never going to get actual equality whilst the lunatics keep up with the divisive and inflamatory rhetoric bundling mens issues in as effects of the patriarchy just to say you care is not actually caring about mens problems feminists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol i love this broad feels bad does nothing take a look at her interview and her beta schlub mras dickriding people doing real work and a femenist virtue signalling all over it its like all men are puppies to her issues are marginalized and ignored because no one respects a man who cannot command people around him to act sucks to some but there it is no amount of sympathy and crying or streaming on netflix will change that glad to see anita sarkesian has upped her game
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if men are concerned about these things perhaps they should advocate about them expect push back feminism certainly got some
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its hard for me to sympathize when they say things like this when mgtow and others make threads like this it only proves feminism more right imo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only real way to progress mens rights is to set fire to the shitty traditionalism which is things like the red pill until men give up toxic masculinity they wont ever progress
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,too frequently tying dating and sex into the movement given how much men are judged on their romantic and sexual success and how many factors in life it affects how can you blame them for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think that most mras think that men and women both suffer significant disadvantages not all do but the majority i think that most mras would be prepared to accept that helping men in some areas is only fair if we also help women in other areas my impression is that few online feminists are willing to accept the reverse maybe its a bit different in real life or if we surveyed less vocal feminists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you see the suicide as a problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres a reason feminist forums are very aggressive about stomping out any mention of mens issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminists probably do care about mens issues however they have a mental shield that will never ever allow them to start thinking about whether or not women have any part in mens issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the more moderate ones have its more the radical ones that do not and in fact double down on women have it worse and men have no issues mentality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so do you just view the mra movement as pointless do you think men can legitimately seek more rights and or general consideration from society im a bit torn on it because i think they do have some legitimate points but ultimately men will always compete with each other its in our nature its required by society and there will always be winners and losers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,leftist lmao
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mra is leftist im going to assume from your screen name and the fact youre a mod of robjectivism that you have somewhat libertarian inclinations no the mhrm mens human rights movement is not leftist nor does it seek leftiststyle social justice the mhrm is based on a methodologically individualist understanding of power see farrells the myth of male power in which explicitly defines power as control over ones own life this is antithetical to the classanalysisbased sjw paradigm which is methodologically collectivist and treats individuals as mere epiphenomena of great social forces look at how individualist feminists like wendy mcelroy are treated by leftistfeminists do you really think the differences between the worldviews are merely matters of tax policy disagreements no theyre fundamentally opposed by the same token the mhrm fundamentally rejects the basic premises behind sjwism methodological collectivism oppressor classoppressed class analysis etc legal activism legal activism is common on all sides of the political spectrum and crybabying surely you can see a difference between a legitimate claim to suffering and an illegitimate one of course the idea that women in the western world are systematically oppressed by men collectively is illegitimate but that doesnt mean that all claims to suffering are worthy of rejection wanting to see changes to certain social norms is not necessarily unjustifiable nor is it crybabying the ironic fact is that by calling mhras crybabies youre not only proving them right that there is an empathy gap and males are regarding as having a duty to suffer for others and shouldnt someone who is an objectivist be against altruism youre also responding to mhras identically to sjw feminists frankly for someone who mods robjectivism maybe you arent an objectivist i wouldnt know you seem to lack an understanding of the difference between methodological individualism the foundation of austrian economics and methodological collectivism you seem unable to tell the difference between a movement built on the former the mhrm and a movement built on the latter sjwism you also seem to not see that if one rejects altruism one should necessarily reject gendertraditionalism since both traditional gender norms mandated altruism albeit in different forms you also seem to be confusing getting together in order to advance a political cause with collectivism which not only validates one of the most hideously inaccurate mischaracterizations of individualist ideas generally ie that individualism requires rejecting social interaction but also makes all individualist political and social activism inherently hypocritical and this would include objectivist organizations too are they collectivist now for joining an organization to advance their ideas what is leftist about the mhrm yeah the mhrm is against a particular traditional norm by that standard objectivists are leftists for being against altruism that the mhrm is a movement which functions through organizations and voluntarilyformed groups by that standard all politics is leftist on economic policy a disproportionate amount of mhras are freemarketlibertarianoriented and from what i know paul elam is a libertarian himself i may be wrong about this i know girlwriteswhat is a libertarian too even by a strictly economic definition the mhra leans right if we define free markets as economically rightwing more than the general population or is it just a distaste for crybabying or to borrow rands basic argument the celebration of victimhood and suffering as the ultimate moral vindication if thats your objection then i can see it having a point but theres a distinction between acknowledging injustices and buying into the morality of altruism surely there is nothing inherently wrong about acknowledging injustices and trying to avoid them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you mean the mra is right wing eg conservative which means wanting to preserve traditional values they are not leftist progressive want to change old values leftist is a not a label for any old radical
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bbc is banned in vietnam every time i happen past rmra there are always a bunch of guys crying that they have been raped some whining that its unfair that hot teachers having sex with horny schoolboys are not prosecute to the max of the law some bitching about women going to the mens toilet etc of nonissues they decided the best way to do activist for men is to participate in the victim olympics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you have any reasoning behind that other than that you dont like them and they have ads on their blogs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youd rather it be handled a more communist way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah thats astonishing funny is that she made the same mistakes as many bloopers but actually overcame them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so like its unfair to blame feminists for the duluth model or now lobbying against shared custody
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is an enlightening comment both feminism and mra have legitimate complaints about the structure of society and the fallout of traditional mating rituals that being said women have made a lot more advances because they support eachother as a collective and bankrolledunopposed by men both men and women do not support mras mra will never get off the ground men are too out for themselves or their teamsgangs etc we can only hope that society as a whole collectively grows more educated and civil and leans towards rational discussion and debate theres to much rhetoric and appeal to emotion and not enough rational fact based argument in our politics today
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree you might enjoy this particular mras book
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a liberal i think a lot of people know that there were a lot of mistakes made and trump somehow becoming a symbol of the common man really demonstrates that many of the people behind those problems are still around and not even entertaining the idea that they made mistakes so there is concern over how we can even move forward
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my issue with both movements is the lunatic fringe yes i agree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are feminists are opposing them it would be nice if theyd stop
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtow isnt the mrm you guys lose it when we quote some nth wave feminist because omg no true feminst then you go and quote people who are emphatically not mras
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because you are threatened by mgtow thanks for linking my post and spreading my message of male freedom it must bother you so much men have no interest in you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought i read in trp where they dont like this movie in part because it was made by a woman and didnt interview the right people meaning them i guess well they say a lot of things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where the fuck is rp traditionalist its all about abandoning the shitty gender roles that hold us back fuck being a beta provider dad lets be players and fuck boys enjoy the decline
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont think women encourage toxic masculinity by preferring powerful successful symmetricalfaced men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont understand trp if you think it has anything to do with traditionalism shitty or otherwise i keep telling you guys that trp is one of the most decadent and progressive places on the whole of reddit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most of what is called toxic masculinity is either bs or attempting to get rid of good parts of masculinity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a confusing name for the movie because it is about mras not about the red pill subreddit i think there was more overlap at one point and both groups liked the matrix analogy but they have diverged significantly now if you read mrm stuff its generally against traditionalism mras love to talk about issues that are caused by traditionalism and how many mens issues go back centuries
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is what feminists actually believe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,until men give up they wont ever progress that is what i hear whenever feminists talk about mens issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes because romantic and sexual access is completely divorced from rights as soon as you bring that up in a rightsbased movement then you make yourself look ridiculous if anything it just perpetuates the stereotype that mras are losers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think youre mistaking the mrm for mens lib the mra are anti feminists at the core and foundation of the group and as such care more about that then mens rights ironically mens lib on the other hand is a group who is feminist friendly and actively work towards fixing the problems men face feminists are willing to work with mens lib but are less likely to work with the mrm due to the groups history with feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive had the exact opposite experience very few mras are willing to admit women still face issues today most of the ones ive spoken to will say women have all the privilege and advantages in todays society and only men are discriminated against otoh i have seen feminists discussing mens issues many times and what do feminists do for men is such a common question on raskfeminists they stickied a post dealing with the subject never seen anything like that on mensrights
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes of course
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont believe in collectivist xxx rights movements mrmare just whiny feminist style men who deal with the world the way all leftists crybabies feminists and women do rp is not part of the mrm rp is enjoy the decline hedonism and getting what you want from women allowing mras ans mgtows on trp ruined it a voice for men was always separate from rp in the manosphere theyre the types of mommy feminist loving fags who join things like the good men project and cry abotu th eburden of male performance and toxic masculinity it was started as an outgrowth of the womens liberation movement by warren farrell at the beqest of i believe gloria steinam for men who were psychologically disposed to feminism but wanted to deal with mens issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,long
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do they want to preserve traditional values traditional and feminist values are that men cant be raped by women men cant be abused by women men should man up and pay for kids theyll never see in a divorce men should never complain about any issue they face men should always defer to women and sacrifice their healthhappiness for women etc mras oppose all this feminists support it so could you list any traditional views mras actually support
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,leftist means using force to get people to do something socialism is a system of force right means removing shackles and letting people do what they want in freedom capitalism is system of freedom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yup
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is sarcasm right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there was that time he told feminists to prove something by donating to him the time he created a fake version of a feminist site that asked for donations and the time he admitted to using donations for personal use
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,accountability would be a good place to start
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never said feminism is perfect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,please men opposed feminism from it inception early suffragettes were jailed fore fed and beaten for their convictions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,look up the history of feminism sometime when women have been imprisoned institutionalised and force fed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this just in feminists are generally massive hypocrites
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they do and some of them like angry mgtow want women to go extinct they also want women to be traditional while they give nothing traditional they detest freedom in a female but think its good in a male
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fuck being a beta provider dad lets be players and fuck boys wow such challenge of gender roles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure and men encouraged women to be submissive housewifes half a century ago they kind of just had to deal with loosing that i dont see what point you have here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is that toxic masculinity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i keep telling you guys that trp is one of the most decadent and progressive places on the whole of reddit do you think i am dumb or something trp shit is exactly the same sexist shit men have been saying for ages progressive my ass the term regressive is more appropriate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i keep telling you guys that trp is one of the most decadent and progressive places on the whole of reddit trp has its issues to much anger phase one problem is people who already know what theyre doing can read it for what it means but people who dont cant and bringing anger and bitterness with you in doing it ruins it from working another anger phase issue is to much desire to get control of the relationship in anger amused mastery with a slice of anger behind it does not get the same response as amused mastery without the anger to much emphasis on alpha and shit tests with a lack of emphasis on comfort tests you need both
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ah yes the good parts of masculinity which encourage men to hide their emotions and bottle them up sure is the best right there woo wee
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you read mrm stuff i already have i had a brief flirt with mraism over a year back they are miles better then any terp but are still stupidly antifeminist and arent radical enough for my tastes i want mras to be protesting in dresses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not a feminist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,on the one hand i concur tying dating and sex into a discussion about rights does make you ridiculous on the other hand i would argue that an awful lot of the gender imbalance issues feminists love to complain about are at their roots the consequences of human sexual dimorphism and their different approaches to dating ie plenty of the discrimination women face is just the other side of the coin of the innate edge they have when it comes to dating wage gap can be explained by men being forced into striving for success if they want to improve their dating options while the same doesnt really apply to women by the way the same applies to male violence displays of strength displays of high value postbreakup murder well its perverted mateguarding which is something men do women initiate most of the breakups women have an easier time finding a replacement etc rape again why should women rape of they can get sex pretty easily anyway and so on in my humble opinion genderrelated research preferably that not done by gender studies is far too hesitant to attribute plenty of phenomena to that dimorphism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about the feminists complaints about slut shaming and the like dont they fall into the same category
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wait so if i start murdering people and give the motivation that im murdering incels then the murders would be okay because its ridiculous to suggest that depriving someone of something their life for being unsexy is wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,helping men and opposing feminism often go hand in hand for instance mras want equal custody rights for men feminists oppose this and want women to retain their privileges here mras cant fight for this without also opposing feminism if feminists would stop being antimensrights then mras would stop being antifeminism its like saying mlk spent too much time opposing segregationists rather than fighting for black rights and menslib is addressing mens issues by treating men as the problem its all about toxic masculinity and getting men to check their privilege and so on you arent even allowed to discuss things like male reproductive rights the unfair way men are treated in dv situations where theyre the victim and men being raped by women in rmenslib
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you talking about mens lib as in rmenslib that subreddit is a joke the only thing they want to talk about is toxic masculinity and how women always have it worse i am still waiting for an explanation from those people as to why women cant handle seeing a picture of giselle bündchen or ardianna lima without developing an eating disorder and needing societal support but if men feel bad about seeing women posting pictures of alexander skarsgaard or terry crews then that is their own problem and nothing society should care about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wholeheartedly disagree i dont see antifeminism as the core of the mrm many probably most mras say that they are feminists by the dictionary definition ie gender equality obviously there is a lot of antifeminism on mrm groups by antifeminism i mean opposition to feminism as practiced not against gender equality the reason for this is because the mrm believes that men are disadvantaged in many areas and women are disadvantaged in many other areas as such you combat inequality by helping both men and women in their areas of disadvantage however feminism tends to think of just women as disadvantaged and so it works to help women in their areas of disadvantage and in some cases helps women in their areas of advantage this is seen by mras as increasing gender inequality in my opinion i think mras are protestant feminists they agree with gender equality but they think that feminism is doing gender equality wrong and so there is a lot of anger against feminism as practiced in past centuries there was a lot of protestant animosity towards catholics you could say that protestants were anticatholic however that could be a misleading term out of context anticatholic might mean atheist or satanist but the reality is that both protestants and catholics are christians and there are a lot of common beliefs in the same way the mrm is antifeminist but it doesnt mean that the mrm is against gender equality it means that the mrm has a different understanding of the world than feminism and that there will therefore be disagreements about how to achieve gender equality it doesnt mean the mrm is traditionalist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mens lib on the other hand is a group who is feminist friendly and actively work towards fixing the problems men face even tho they arent doing shit for men more so they talk about women and their issues more so than that of mens issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mens lib that bunch of cucks sorry i had to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive had the exact opposite experience very few mras are willing to admit women still face issues today most of the ones ive spoken to will say women have all the privilege and advantages in todays society and only men are discriminated against so kinda like the reverse of feminists otoh i have seen feminists discussing mens issues many times pointing out that men are toxic and privileged isnt really the same thing and what do feminists do for men is such a common question on raskfeminists they stickied a post dealing with the subject because they claim to be working for men too so its fair to ask them and the answers are usually like we oppose the patriarchy which hurts men too never seen anything like that on mensrights mras dont lie and claim theyre equally for women the way feminists pretend theyre for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well id agree that mras do little for women i dont think that is seen as part of their purview though because feminism already exists id be pretty shocked if most mras say that only men face disadvantages though maybe ill post a poll
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have seen feminists discussing mens issues many times and yet a mod from rmenslib outright admitted otherwise more so anyone can take a look at feminist discussion and see feminist barely talk about mens issues and when they do it no matter what ends up about women as to feminists they cant have men have issues as to them it takes away from womens issues never seen anything like that on mensrights ya because feminists by and large have not done anything for men if anything they have done more harm to men than anything else
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well its early days for the poll but these are the results thus far httpiimgurcomcfgrpbrpng httpiimgurcomrpecfwfpng
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think i was a bit of a crybaby in my twenties but i wanted to solve my own problems not be part of a movement i still think though that some men need support not every man can be an island maybe that doesnt fit into your worldview but people generally are going to form likeminded groups and try to advance their collective interests its just something that human beings tend to do and have probably always done
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not all men can become the hedonistic platespinning players that trp preaches them to be mgtow is the only real answer if you actually swallow the pill that is you internalize the rule you internalize that all women are like that you stop believing in unicorns and do the inevitable mens rights activism is for crybabies and victim olympics participants mens lib is for cucks and faggots trp is for wannabe alphachads there is no other way apart from plugging back into the white picket fence dream than giving up on being a working horse of society
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre right chad alphas represent the bourgeoisie and mras represent the other of men in accordance with our leftism me must purge the bourgeoisie
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpswwwavoiceformencomfeminismfeministliesfeminismwomenwerenotoppressedbynothavingthevote httpswwwavoiceformencomwomenalettertotraditionalwomenrevisited heres a wonderful article about the daughter of a feminist who has made the kitchen the focus of her life with no regrets why the kitchen because it allows her to be a good mother most people agree that working moms are bad for kids and bad for marriage httpswwwavoiceformencomgynocentrismthemythofthestrongindependentwoman httpswwwavoiceformencommenmensissuesanopenlettertochristianconservativeswhyyoulostandwhatisuggestyoudoaboutit i find much good in traditional conservative values the mens rights movement may not have started as a traditionalist conservative movement but thats who coopted it and thats who drives it now ill let you digest and wait to see how youre going to spin this one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,leftist means using force to get people to do something socialism is a system of force right means removing shackles and letting people do what they want in freedom capitalism is system of freedom that is such a practiced set of lines intended to elicit some type of emotional response
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if thats what you believe even without leftist beliefs freedom can be extraordinarily damaging especially when abused
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,look it up in the dictionary and get back to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats authoritarionlibertarian if i recall correctly left is about belief in equality and right is about understanding that hierarchy is inevitable you can technically be for example right wing authoritarian religeous conservatives are example where you want force people to do something yet believe in the inevitable inequality in our society
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that doesnt line up with how the political spectrum is generally used theocrats fascists etc are very happy with force and they both go on the right with only two sides were bound to have people who arent that similar go together like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no bbc is really blocked here but very sporadically like earlier today it was blocked but now its not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,any sources on any of these
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youd agree that many mens issues are directly caused by feminist policies and dogma
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the context of this conversation why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats an outright lie mgtow does not want women to go extinct we choose to live our lives on our own terms without the false idea of needing female validation this is threatening to you because the entire femaleoriented consumer economy depends on women spending more money than they make and they look to men to compensate them for this disparity in their basic logic brain functions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is just as much as it would be for a woman to say im not going to marry at and become a housewife im going to do what i want with my body
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this party is dull and boring i wish my girlfriend was here because she makes me laugh you know who said that nobody ever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my point is that you cant decide what you desire sexuality is inherently a traditional repetive force not a construct you can delete and rewrite so if women arent willing to admit and forego their attraction to violent dominant men at the cost of decreasing their pleasure then its laughable that you expect men to repress their desire to acquire influence and power to make themselves appear more pleasing to women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,females reward the most dominant males with affection and respect which causes the competition among and selfhatred in men that adventure time here thinks is blocking human progress
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it sets a standard for masculinity that is aggressive uncooperative and stubborn a lot of people here will argue that dominance has positive connotations and thats what they really mean when they talk about dominant men but in terms of actionable content rather than subjective feelings there isnt a significant difference to me that being said women arent responsible for any of this in the moral sense id only accept that theyre nonmorally responsible in the butterfly effect sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tradition would be marrying a woman early on and than working all hours to support her and your children in and big house where does trp argue to do that trp argues that old traditionalism is gone you dont need marriage to have sex you can get it without commitment therefore improve your attractiveness in y and z to improve your chances thats about it the main unifying incentive behind trp is how to get ones dick wet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i largely blame women for enforcing the male behaviors you outlined ive found that more often than not women select for men that are more stoic in nature im not saying they cant express anything but it has to be calculated and limited if women selected for different traits the sexual marketplace would be look a lot different and this applies to feminist women as well they often dont realize theyre selecting against what they advocate for but thats how it goes with a lack of self awareness i ve lived in mostly liberal cities my entire life and women still select for the same types of men to reiterate women dictate how men act and reward the toxic mascuilinity traits to the detriment of men imho ive never felt such pressures from my fellow men in fact theyve been supportive and empathetic to my issues with women ive learned to act a heckuva a lot differently if im interested in being anything beyond acquantance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are less emotional they only hide their emotions from girls and people they arent close friends with but in general there arent many extreme emotions to hide i have cried maybe three times in the past decade and those were the only times i ever really felt like crying many girls have trouble understanding this they feel and express emotions so much more strongly than men men hide their emotions from women because women dont think emotional guys are sexy feminists will talk all day about how men should be able to open up their emotions in society but they will still chase after those guys who are naturally stoic even when a lot of those guys are just doing the same kind of moderate suppression like most feminist goals for men the only men who follow the new feminist guidelines are the guys those feminists didnt want to have sex with in the first place
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have no problem discussing how toxic men are can you list ways in which they arent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know too many men who want to do anything other than keep their emotions in check for all the selfindulgent talk i read from men about how bad it is that they have to bottle up their emotions i doubt that too many of them would want to look weak by public displays of emotions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,odd how feminism that is about liberating men and want to allow men to have emotions only ever allow men two feelings rage at other men and selfhatred
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is even less credible than i am not a racist but
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would argue that an awful lot of the gender imbalance issues feminists love to complain about are at their roots the consequences of human sexual dimorphism and their different approaches to dating ie plenty of the discrimination women face is just the other side of the coin of the innate edge they have when it comes to dating yeah thats a good point i agree with you but i personally treat it with derision when they moan about women being depicted as sex objects for example i dont think youre british so you may not know what is this is something to which feminists are naturally opposed and i can understand their arguments to some extent but women getting their kit off is simply sexy it always has been and it always will be even other women find it sexy ive been with girls who found their own gender sexier than men although they sought the masculinity of men in relationships men getting their kit off can be sexy but the male form even the idealised male form just isnt as sexy as the female form historically that is clearly the case but its the same principle there isnt much point in women moaning about how hot women are disproportionately valued which is unfair and there isnt much point in men moaning about the way womens sexuality works which is also unfair nothing can be done to change this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is akin to black people complaining about being called nggers its completely different in my opinion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont really understand your argument here sexual intercourse has to be based on consent you cant force women to sleep with men to whom theyre not attracted while i understand that rejection is painful i know this from my own life there is no point in moaning about it it wont change anything it cant change anything so there is no point in mras talking about sex relationships and dating
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive been actively part of feminist circles for about years and never once have i met a feminist that doesnt think that men deserve equal custody rights the problem is what the groups see as equal rights many feminists believe with their own evidence to back it up that men are equally granted custody if custody is fought for by the father the problem is that men dont ask for custody at the same frequency as women here is an example of where the mentality comes from im not here to argue this point or do i want to because most proanti feminist arguments are fruitless just telling you the reasoning behind the stance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only people ive seen who dont like menslib are the ones who cant help but denigrate feminism or feminists or women instead of actually focusing on mens issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im talking about the movement the sub is a small section of the movement itself also why put toxic masculinity in quotations toxic masculinity is what causes many of the societal problems that men face even if you dont like the term itself its the term used to describe why men are made fun of for being victims of abuse for showing many emotions encouraged to be more aggressive for being shamed for not looking like alexander skargaard all of it comes from our societal definition of masculinity of all places to pretend like it isnt a thing lol trp is all about toxic masculinity and using it to their advantage also the reason youre still waiting for an explanation to that is because its a strawman feminists dont believe men should deal with it after all thats a discussion about toxic masculinity which is a term that came from feminists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont mean to be rude but i dont think you know the history of the group the mens liberation movement began by scholars studying feminist ideologies this movement began as profeminist critical assessment cultural views of masculinity and the tax that it had on men which would be like not believing male rape victims exist or shaming boys for showing certain emotions it split into two groups one stayed mens lib and the other was dubbed the mens rights movement the mrm was an antifeminist group from the very beginning back in the they existed to oppose feminism more than anything else what youre talking about is mens lib and yes there will always be people who are part of the movement that dont share the values of the movement itself and these individuals in the mrm would be more welcomed for their ideas in mens lib circles here is a paper on it that is worth the read if you want to put in the time if you want any other information about the origin of the movements i can give you some other sources some are in german and are harder to understand when translated though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,many probably most mras say that they are feminists by the dictionary definition ie gender equality the dictionary meaning of feminism is a movement on womens issues and despite what feminists say their own actions show they dont want gender equality but women to be more equal than men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they talk about how misogyny affects men that isnt the same thing as talking about women since many of mens issues have a root cause of feminine things being shameful example male rape victims are often not taken seriously because of the societal assumption that only women can be victims of rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not seeing your evidence for any of that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rps hard focus on self reliance and responsibility cannot live in harmony with the but thats unfair lets change it sentiments some men dont want to succeed or die trying they want to change the game these some men should not be on the red pill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being a rugged individualist is cool and all but there is strength in numbers and people who believe in the possibility of social change also succeed in changing society more often some people give up too soon life is about winning so why not use groups to change the society to be the way you want its hard for me to wrap my head around as im individualist too and hate politicspeople in general
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i still think though that some men need support yes men need support but not in the form of a mental health hygiene wash now wilfred why dont you talk about your anger towards your mother while i assume you have aspergers or some other psychosis that i can build a case out of and not really help you find closure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have no objection to men gtow i have an objection to them stinking up a forum for young men trying to succeed with their losery defeatist whiny sadsack words
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or you can be like my husband happily on his second marriage who fought in the courts for equal custody of his daughter and to prevent his ex from leaving the area actually do something for mens rights
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a none of those are about retuning women to the way they were in the olden days b most are just counting the feminst notion that being a housewife is the worst oppression ever c telling women its ok to be be a mom and housewife isnt the same as saying they must be d you didnt hit on any mras saying they want to remove womens rights e could you address any of the issues i raised in my previous post that mras are undeniably fighting for and that definitely represent a rejection of traditional views
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,imo fasicism is leftist in the past after not when monarchs ruled our asses we were more free now that the state has much more power and rules our asses lets go back to the time when we were free not forward where we will be even less free than now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont remember the title of the post where i read the first one and i dont want to search avfm httpswwwavoiceformencomallbulletinsonthequestionoffinancialtransparency
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i would not agree id say that some mens issues are exasperated by feminists but i highly doubt theres many issues that are directly caused by feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because im wondering why you think men should have it easy when women didnt most of the mens rights people seem to just like to whine and think women will come along and fix things for them change doesnt just happen people who care about it make it happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lots of people then they abandon going to your shitty parties and organise their own gatherings
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not exactly accurate take a look at this study yali preferred low womens whr and relatively high womens but not mens lbr womens and mens ratings of each sds set were similar which suggests that the maletaller norm in yali tribe was far weaker than in western cultures additionally the observed preferences were modified by contact with different cultures age and accessibility of food resources pig possession our results suggest that human norms of attractiveness are malleable and can change with exposure to different environments and conditions sexuality is fluid and cultural not completely innate personally i think its due to how images are stored in the subconscious mind which then influences behavior of course culture changes slowly and enabling change is not an overnight kind of thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that adventure time here i see what you did there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well you cant make women be attracted to men they arent attracted to thats not fair to them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres nothing toxic about preferring dominant men you dont seem to understand what toxic masculinity is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminism is a societywide shit test this is one thing i have yet to see any real evidence against at least when it comes to western feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes lots of people in society are sexists including feminists and this isnt some kind of nonsense gynocentric shit also i have had a shit ton of men in my life tell me i needed to man up and be stoic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am not sure this is what you are going for here but i find that men still do have emotional outlets and vent their feelings but only when they are outside of the vision of women when its am on a boys camping trip and they are around the fire the facade comes down there are some women who dont think men are capable of emotional expression and depth but thats because they never see it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know what to tell you there i dont believe in the patriachy so i am not a feminist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is it i mean when i say that prefer to avoid someone with a sexual history because i think that means that wed be more likely to divorce most feminists consider that to be slut shaming
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think their contribution to the conversation about sex relationships and dating has more to do with making some of us me for example more aware of the masculine perspective on all of this theyve said a lot of horrible stupid things because some horrible stupid people want in on this movement but ignore the dark triads for a moment part of the masculine perspective is that not every guy is able to navigate complex social situations to begin with and many progressive allies feel betrayed by the recent focus on negative reinforcement especially through societal shamingshunning which is nowhere near harmless or innocent httpwwwalternetorgculturesocialdeathpenaltywhybeingostracizedhurtsevenmorebullying think of it this way when a plea of just help us figure this casual sex thing out from men who lack basic social instincts automatically connects in too many minds to forcing women into sex rather than thought how is that not ableist punching down moreover how is that actually helping any women is the goal to make them more paranoid it also means that a lot of men who struggle in modern society will turn to men like paul elam and donald trump to help them in that struggle or stormfront as will it seems too many women who worry about mens issues too and who want to hear those issues defined by men thing of it was i didnt even notice the patterns in any of this until i was in a few relationships with women who had hypermasculine brains their alpha senses were struggling with the exact same problems avoid saying or doing anything with unfortunate associations just isnt how their brains work too often ive had to help find the bodies after their social trainwrecks asking them to be more sensitive really isnt helping
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if being unable to have sex was just that an inability to have sex then i dont think many mras would be talking about it but men who are unable to attract anyone dont suffer just that one consequence they are pretty severely penalized for it in multiple aspects of life i understand you think it cant be changed but we both know you dont actually have any halfsolid reason why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are frequently told to not even bother by their lawyers because if they fight the mom will retaliate some custody is better than losing everything same reason black kids are more likely to take plea deals even when theyre innocent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the problem is what the groups see as equal rights that is the problem and feminists dont want actual equality but something that favors them this has been shown time and time again with the feminist group now fighting father rights groups when it comes to custody as now fights against any law saying there should be custody unless otherwise
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive been actively part of feminist circles for about years and never once have i met a feminist that doesnt think that men deserve equal custody rights when feminists claim to be in favor of mens rights its generally little more than a purely verbal declaration they will fight tooth and nail against antifemale discrimination real or imagined but keep a very low profile once it comes to antimale discrimination they managed to summon huge shitstorms that cost tim hunt his job over a silly remark regarding women in science but i have yet to find a single feminists advocating for the firing of face it feminists complain against every slight against women andor their ideology but when it comes to backing up their claim that theyre for men too theyre sticking to mere lipservice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,heaven forbid one is critical of feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then you should look through some discussions concerning menslib on rfemradebates
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why put toxic masculinity in quotations probably because like me they think it means all of masculinity is toxic to which feminist do think so before you say otherwise name me one masculine trait feminists have not deemed toxic toxic masculinity is what causes many of the societal problems that men face because the word is black and white right i think if you broke away from your black and white thinking and actually took on intersectional thinking you find women and society itself are the causes of many mens issues not masculinity but blaming women is sexist and not solely blaming men isnt following the feminist narrative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im talking about the movement the sub is a small section of the movement itself also why put toxic masculinity in quotations toxic masculinity is what causes many of the societal problems that men face even if you dont like the term itself its the term used to describe why men are made fun of for being victims of abuse for showing many emotions encouraged to be more aggressive for being shamed for not looking like alexander skargaard all of it comes from our societal definition of masculinity i will stop using quotation marks when i see women being made to answer for their role in perpetuation gender roles for men feminists dont believe men should deal with it after all thats a discussion about toxic masculinity which is a term that came from feminists i can show you plenty of feminists who will gladly post pictures of mandingo making it clear that this is how the ideal man should look and then kick and scream about right to preference and fragile male ego when confronted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you are mistaken and i think the author of that article is mistaken perhaps through miscommunication or ideological bias the author suggests that goldbergs mrm work and mens lib was separated by not basic differences of ideology or analysis but rather of emphasis and focus to me that doesnt imply antifeminist it just means that they are talking about a neglected part of gender equality i also disagree in a few parts with that text where it talks about spousal violence being one way that seems completely wrong and makes me doubt the authors thought process several meta analyses indicate that spousal violence is very much a twoway problem somewhat more women than men end up in emergency rooms due to such violence but the discrepancy is not so large as to warrant anything other than genderneutral policies httpwwwspringerpubcommediaspringerjournalsfindingsataglancepdf yes some studies show a big discrepancy but those tend to be either collected by police and police are told to be biased to arrest the man or collected at womens shelters not representative of society as a whole anyways it seems like there are several points in the article where the author seems to misinterpret what mras mean and then paint the movement in a negative light and there are parts as in the spousal violence discussion where the author disagrees on the fundamental facts and therefore his view is that the mrm is antiequality but if his facts are wrong then his conclusion must change
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you want any other information about the origin of the movements i can give you some other sources some are in german and are harder to understand when translated though not who you were replying to but id be grateful if you could give me those sources im german so no need to bother with translations
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fwiw these are the early results from a poll posted to the mensrights subreddit httpiimgurcomcfgrpbrpng httpiimgurcomrpecfwfpng
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it split into two groups one stayed mens lib and the other was dubbed the mens rights movement uh pretty sure mens lib died off in the and didnt come back until recent these individuals in the mrm would be more welcomed for their ideas in mens lib circles bull fucking shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they talk about how misogyny affects men more like talk about how men are at fault for misogyny male rape victims are often not taken seriously because of the societal assumption that only women can be victims of rape something feminists reinforce i mean just look at the rape discussion and its men rape women are victims bring up male victims and its either men cant be raped a common view within feminism it seems or what about the menz but feminists totally dont contribute to causing mens issues even tho they do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,evidence of what i dont expect you to see any evidence of that because well in feminist land talking about the menz is when you talk about womens issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rps hard focus on self reliance and responsibility cannot live in harmony with the but thats unfair lets change it sentiments it absolutely can theres no reason a person cant believe that a society will not help them now but b society should be adjusted to help people like them in the future
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the nature of a society of competition is that there will be winners and losers its obvious to me that the losers arent just going to accept it meekly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why bother changing society for the future for the kids theyre either not here yet or dont know what they want yet the effort level isnt worth it enjoy your time you wont be remembered your name wont be in history books enjoy the time you have on this rock and say goodnight at the end
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a d the titles literally say things like why women shouldnt vote try a little harder than that b c judgybitch and others literally say women who work and dont chose a traditional life are bad mothers are literally incapable of being good mothers i posted examples above so you may want to read it again in case you missed those e you asked me to prove that traditionalist ideas are prevalent in the mra which i did how about this since you are the one arguing that mens rights activists are fighting for issues that are antitraditionalist like fathers getting custody and helping men who are victims of abuse how about you show some evidence of what tangible actions mras are and have taken towards those goals if you want people to believe the mra is working for mens rights prove it with specific examples instead of constantly straw manning feminists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have libertarian sympathies so i understand the sentiment in your second paragraph but the political spectrum youre using is your own idiosyncratic one from wikipedia fascism is usually placed on the farright within the traditional left–right spectrum
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,heres an article about his fake version of a feminist site quite clearly the objective is to make an argument that men can be victims of domestic violence too its ludicrous to suggest that hes trying to trick people out of their money the site has vastly different content than the original heres him admitting to using donations for personal use hes saying he has not yet figured out a way to do this hours a day and also hold a full time job and this arrangement has yet to earn me minimum wage for my efforts unbelievable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because im wondering why you think men should have it easy when women didnt i dont think anyone said anything about having it easy the closest was the first person to respond to you who mentioned pushback from feminists which shouldnt be expected for things like movember
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol well i see you have done your homework i havent seen that video im sure it doesnt mean mgtow wants women to be extinct i will take an educated guess and say hes talking about how womens current behavior will drive them into extinction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this video explains how women will eventually go extinct as the artificial womb becomes prominent and men stop having sex with women and instead choose sex bots and other methods to get sexual release mgtow understand that feminism has lead to the extinction of women in nonprofits activism views since oct ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not trying to be against difference i think sadism is a pretty consistent force throughout history though break off and join a commune and youll find a cult leader a similar hierarchical structure will always form
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree my point is its convinient for feminists to discuss male motivation disconnected from female involvement in rewarding male behavior mras do the same thing you just seperate the two genders and then blame and offer prescriptions to the side you arent in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not convinced you really understand it yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes we get it mr awesome women are never responsible for anything ever if i told you about queen bitch i briefly knew in college who could never pass an exam because she was too busy gossiping and intriguing instead of studying you would probably tell me that she was oppressed and couldnt find the mental energy to focus on her studies because she was being oppressed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think the problem is that dominance is amoral women are attracted to male dominance regardless of the rights and wrongs of the display of dominance obviously both men and women cant help who or what theyre sexually attracted to so its wrong to negatively judge people for this however its perfectly reasonable to point out that the average woman desires traits in men which are counter to normal civilised society which is based upon cooperation and a quid pro quo philosophy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok well then that needs to be addressed in discussions of toxic masculinty i rarely see people mention that women select for these behaviors until women self reflect and change their preferences nothing will change its always a bunch of hand waving and passing the blame to other men as if men are not just reacting to womens preferences if women truly wanted sensitive expressive dudes a lot of men would act accordingly if women cannot renegotiate what they find attractive in men they should really stop giving them bogus advice which leads to frustration depression and eventually trp or something like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats it men are occasionally slightly less toxic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not having this discussion again i cant be bothered
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre more likely to be divorced if you marry someone who doesnt have enough experience and then gets frustrated when she turns ive seen that plenty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when a plea of just help us figure this casual sex thing out from men who lack basic social instincts automatically connects in too many minds to forcing women into sex rather than thought how is that not ableist punching down moreover how is that actually helping any women my guess is this is because feminism ie that part of the sjw camp that has a monopoly on interpreting anything genderrelated is pretty much exclusively occupied with how things affect women yeah even the issues around the feminism is for men tooclaim is mostly about women its mostly aimed at molding the affected men into a specific form thats more convenient for the women in these mens lives when it comes to the casual datingissue id argue that the feminist response is mostly motivated by several factors feminist dogma feminists are far to obsessed with their idea of female objectification to make the life easier for guys who intent to participate in the hookup culture and far too indifferent towards male suffering especially when its directly related to female choice which by definition is beyond reproach to give a shit about how these guys feel selective perception the cutsection between guys who suck at dating and guys who are assholes you mentioned they dont pay attention to the guys who struggle and suffer in silence why check aforementioned bullet point but to those who are vitriolic about it the complete and utter unwillingness to accept that theres something like female privilege think of it women by default have access to the casual dating scene they dont need advice on how to enter it but rather on how to navigate it or if it isnt their cup of tea on how to avoid it men on the other hand dont have automatic access to the casual dating scene and oftentimes them being left out and kept out only reinforces the feminists resolve this inherent contradiction by vilifying the guys who are unable to find sex andor romance because if a guy who is an asshole doesnt get affection its no reason to be worried about or wonder about the injustice of the world generally the fact that the the way women in general have handled the puaphenomenon is already pretty telling when it wasnt completely hostile men wanting to figure out how to get laid as often as possible whan an outrage it was about the direct payoff for women oh finally men want to learn how to become great flirts and be interesting but of course we expect you to be faithful and dont use women with your newfound powers boys ie again everything was about women first and most which is why trp is so adamant about removing male sexual strategies from a femaleprimary perspective
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are two aspects to this firstly there is no amount of protest that will make women have sex with men to whom theyre not attracted secondly we generally reside in a culture in which bullying is discouraged some progress has been made on this matter but in a competitive society the winners will still feel like winners and the losers will be made to feel like losers if there is any solution to this it is not more rights for men it is to organise society in a less competitive more collaborative fashion but there are massive extremely powerful forces opposed to this so it is never likely to happen the only other solution is to just keep plugging away work on yourself and try to be one of the winners
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,let me refer you back to this im not here to argue this point or do i want to because most proanti feminist arguments are fruitless just telling you the reasoning behind the stance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you say so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah because feminism is totally not intersectional these are strawman arguments come back with some solid basis and ill listen but for now this is exactly why i dont like arguing about feminism with people who have already made their minds up about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like what im not sure why youre showing me this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what do you consider masculine traits i genuinely couldnt think of anything that is an actual trait of masculinity and not just a social expectation thats talked about with toxic masculinity being stoic isnt seen as negative even within toxic masculinity as long as it isnt forced upon the individual what black and white thinking toxic masculinity is societal not just internalized that includes women and society toxic masculinity is a term that is used to describe a specific kind of misandry
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,toxic masculinity is societal i said that its internalized by all people just like misogyny and misandry cool thanks for pointing out the fact that individuals do in fact have individualized opinions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre arguing with something from the and on comments that i dont even agree with there are multiple sources like this but that was the only one available for free the movements have evolved but go and look at rmensrights and compare it to rmenslib only one is full of hate and spends a good chunk of its time on feminists the other actually has many articles and threads dedicated to the discussion of mens issues even if you personally dont like the sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,here is one i can link you to the other is called die bewegung der männerrechtler im wien der zwischenkriegszeit by elisabeth malleier which i cant find online but is referenced quite a lot in other papers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,polls like that have never been accurate you can see the truth for yourself through their actions even if they dont say it outright
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great argument buddy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about the menz is a phrase that is making fun of people who try to talk over womens issues with things men face it isnt saying that it isnt an issue but using it to silence women is not helping them you can try and change it to mean something else but that has always been the case people who talk shit about female victims by citing male victims dont give a shit about the victims at all they just want to silence others discussion and you wont find a third wave feminist that thinks men cant be raped who is accepted into the community
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,anyone who reads the second link can clearly tell that it isnt about women its about men and how thew regard women and how that perception effects them as they build themselves around those perceptions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,articles about mens issues are too often not actually about mens issues theyre either about issues with menmasculinity or issues with womenfeminism they are talking about articles the entirety of feminist discussion on men is not limited to articles nor snarky tone again i will direct you to raskfeminists to see more varied discussion on that i do agree with their point that feminist articles about mens issues arent that great unless theyre written by male feminists men know better about mens experiences than women these types of things should be left to men not female feminists we can support and encourage men to talk about their issues we can listen and learn from them but i am convinced it is men who need to take the reigns here and lead discussions on mens issues the same as rpers just dont understand the female experience there are ways women wont get the male experience either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why dont we all stop expecting anything from society now or future life sucks balls if you worry about that shit expecting things to change is a one sided contract no matter what side youre on editfixed my your
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the nature of a society of competition is that there will be winners and losers no this is wrong what a lot of men want is closure in the form of success meaningful success such as possessing the ability to perform a job or a task to adequate completion success is not someone who has a job but doesnt really know how to do it success is at least partially being able to do a job but may not have the job a person is trained for even if a person doesnt have the job they are trained for they do have some sense of closure because the yare capable and ready
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for yourself sometimes social problems wont wait around for you to enjoy your life but need to be addressed immediately and if you do become famous and avoid getting killed youll probably get laid too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a d the titles literally say things like why women shouldnt vote try a little harder than that one says that and its obvious satire by that logic feminsts legitimately want to kill all men b c judgybitch and others literally say women who work and dont chose a traditional life are bad mothers are literally incapable of being good mothers i posted examples above so you may want to read it again in case you missed those so if you arent taking part in raising your kid then you really arent a great parent e you asked me to prove that traditionalist ideas are prevalent in the mra which i did no you didnt how about this since you are the one arguing that mens rights activists are fighting for issues that are antitraditionalist like fathers getting custody and helping men who are victims of abuse how about you show some evidence of what tangible actions mras are and have taken towards those goals what tangible evidence is there that mras are forcing women back in to the kitchen seems you have a double standard here if you want people to believe the mra is working for mens rights prove it with specific examples instead of constantly straw manning feminists see this is really annoying ill cite feminsts actually doing something and youll call it a straw man then come back with something you found on the red pill to condemn mras
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,usually not always sometimes its on the left but generally more in the mid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,quite clearly the object is to make an argument that men can be victims of domestic violence too its ludicrous to suggest that hes trying to trick people out of their money i could buy that if his version wasnt claiming the other was the fake why also asking for donations hes saying he has not yet figured out a way to do this hours a day and also hold a full time job and arrangement has yet to earn me minimum wage for my efforts so youre not disputing his using donations for personal use youre just okay with it because of his justification cool i guess its not my money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it should be expected for things like marital rape either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when people want others to go extinct they always make an excuse about the other peoples behavior to justify genocide plus he seems to be celebrating this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know this will probably sound ridiculously optimistic to you but i think that we can evolve beyond sadism as a controlling principle as a human race i really do think of all of the famous leaders in the world who are pacifists its not all built on this framework of dominance and control there is absolutely that element present but its toxic and needs to be called out as such which is why i think we need feminism especially radical gendercritical feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right on been saying this for a while if women didnt select for certain behaviors a lot of men would stop doing them and adjust its really convenient how women are always excluded from the topic of what governs male behavior fuck id even go as far as to say women are the primary force in dictating how males behave i think a lot of men would love to be a differnet way but they learn that women respond unfavorably ftr almost none of my male friends have ever disowned me or told me to man up the pressures i feel to do so are largely from women ive wanted to fuck learned pretty quick that being expressive and sensitive were huge turnoffs among other things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you knew a bitchy woman le gasp better assume all women are bitches just to be safe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can just do things for your own good without the sexual reward of women you know what are you just like a sexual robot who cant function without a clear path to fucking jesus christ man grow a spine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think that the nature of toxic masculinity is a learned one and that innately men are not toxic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no amount of protest that will make women have sex with men to whom theyre not attracted we dont need them to the winners will still feel like winners and the losers will be made to feel like losers will be made to as in you believe that it is absolutely impossible for society to stop ridiculing and bashing sexually unsuccessful men and equally impossible for society to stop penalizing them materially for reasons that amount to because fuck you thats why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but there are massive extremely powerful forces opposed to this so it is never likely to happen just for reference care to explain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont say so feminists say so theres plenty of evidence to support feminism wanting women to be more equal than men despite feminists saying so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre playing pigeon chess right now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is an example of standard rhetoric from menslib everything is mens fault always
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i genuinely couldnt think of anything that is an actual trait of masculinity and not just a social expectation thats talked about with toxic masculinity so you admit that toxic masculinity is nothing more than saying masculinity itself is toxic then being stoic isnt seen as negative even within toxic masculinity as long as it isnt forced upon the individual and yet it is as even when its not forced its seen as bad because one isnt showing their emotions and that being feminine which feminists want men to be i yet to see a single feminist article or that academic paper for that matter saying they want to keep masculinity around or that its a good thing even i know you wont believe me but i have read quite a few articles and papers from feminists saying masculinity bad femininity good in short heres an example from bashing the hell out of masculinity and that white men as us whites are evil yo and probably the only real noted male feminist academia person michael kimmel has gone on a crusade to attack masculinity and burn it to the ground least to say theres a reason why the manosphere has gotten more and more popular and the push back against feminism has only increased of late part of it is feminists relentless attack on masculinity and it wanting to remove it because you know its evil when femininity is good what black and white thinking i am talking about the sheer lack of approach of intersectionality in your uh thinking here youre basically blaming masculinity as the fault for mens issues not women and society as well and no toxic masculinity is not societal its been confirmed to male behavior that other males not women or society reinforce i have never seen another feminist say otherwise excluding you toxic masculinity is a term that is used to describe a specific kind of misandry thats a new one for me i thought you feminists deny the existence of misandry as not real as sexism against men can never happen despite the untold amount of evidence otherwise
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,toxic masculinity is societal i said that its internalized by all people just like misogyny and misandry when i see women being made to answer for their role in perpetuation gender roles for men so when will this happen cool thanks for pointing out the fact that individuals do in fact have individualized opinions so when will women be made to answer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great refute there tho we both know you cant refute the second part especially theres not a single mra ideaviewpoint that mens libfeminism would actually accept
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about the menz is a phrase that is making fun of people who try to talk over womens issues with things men face but its okay when womens issues are talked over issues men face apparently more so one can not talk about mens issues without talking about women but somehow one can talk about women and not include men gotta love the double standard here more so the phrase went from being such to now being used to shut down any mentioning of men but in feminist land any attempt to bring up men is seen as a threat as to you feminists you think it takes away from women as when women are not the focus its somehow bad dont you think its pretty rich and hypocritical for you feminists to claim you are all for gender equality but when the discussion is not focused on women your up in arms over it and you wont find a third wave feminist that thinks men cant be raped who is accepted into the community which community are we talking about here radical wave moderate pop media i mean feminism isnt a monolith now is it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,let me guess you only skimmed it and not actually read it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the entirety of feminist discussion on men is not limited to articles nor snarky tone and yet it seems to be actually limited to such theres next to no activism by feminists for men when this is pointed out feminists say its not about men so why claim gender equality theres next to no feminist academia focus on men when this is pointed out feminists say its not about men so why claim gender equality when feminists get around to talking about mens issues without fail it ends up being about women instead yet trying to bring up men in relation to some womens issues lets say rape and all of sudden its derailing and what about the menz hopefully you see what i am getting at here i am very aware they are talking about an article but to say the discussion on men isnt limited is outright dishonest i mean trying to discuss any mens issue or doing anything for men when its not about women is met with resistance and obstruction by feminists which is pretty ironic thing for feminists to do for example obama created a program for poor minority boys called my brother keeper because it wasnt about women feminists where up in arms over it whining about how it wasnt about them totally disregarding how bad bad minority boys have it today as heaven forbid something isnt about women and their issues its easy to say feminists have to learn its not all about them but they are the ones preaching the very thing they are doing to men the irony is beyond much here men know better about mens experiences than women these types of things should be left to men not female feminists i agree the problem is unless men talk about their issues in allowed feminist ways they are attacked for being sexist and what have you men are also bashed to hell and back for speaking out about their issues even by feminists themselves ya i know feminists are perfect and its a great excuse to make but when you feminists make zero effort or even have a discussion on how feminists are viewing men in such negative ways ucuittler heres a really good on how feminists are viewing men badly and how its not helping the other side of the problem here is because feminists claim they here all about the male experience which is false they think they know what its like to be a man more than us men do nearly every article on mens issues is by some woman who nearly half the time talking out of her ass and using feminist talking points i am convinced it is men who need to take the reigns here and lead discussions on mens issues again i agree but as stated how can we when we are bashed for doing so even by feminists surely you are aware of male tears something no longer used ironically anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whats the point of society if not to make peoples lives better the only real question is how peoples lives should be made better and which people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why worry about changing society for yourself its a lost battle why not change yourself to enjoy the little time you have
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mmkay dude youre still straw manning i answered your questions you dont want to answer mine i backed up my claim you wont or or cant back up yours whatever have a nice day
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i could buy that if his version wasnt claiming the other was the fake why also asking for donations link so youre not disputing his using donations for personal use youre just okay with it because of his justification countless advocacy organizations use donations to pay staff the aclu uses donations to pay staff youre just holding a group you dont like to an unrealistically high standard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you meant that marital rape should not have been accepted then i agree but thats a bit of a nonsequitur
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i havent seen that video maybe ill check it out later the point is mgtow is a not a group its a decentralized movement of men from a broad range of the socioeconomic spectrum you cant label the entire mgtow community based on the words of a single person
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im aroused by bdsm though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how about you try to actually read and reply to the comment instead of just using your reptile brain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol are you serious yea i forgot sex and intimacy aret important things to most people and our biological imperative is nonexistent i guess youre advocating mgtow or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and ignoring the obvious importance of sex and intimacy to most people you have to realize that even if i act differently around women it doesnt mean im not being myself around say family or my guy friends i just know that if im courting a woman i need to adjust what is and is not acceptable and that often includes censoring my emotional state to some extent i dont like doing that but ive learned through trial and error
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but all masculinity is innately toxic tell me how often do you discuss toxic femininity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is some dodgey research
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not at all i would advocate a completely different societal and economic structure but the fact is that is not going to happen in our lifetimes all of the existing social economic and environmental trends are going to get worse you seem to think that im one of the winners which is not necessarily the case at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know you just contradicted yourself right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know you just called yourself completely ignorant right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,menslib is one of the worst subs on reddit they once banned a male rape victim because he was critical of the way his feminist friends treated him after he was raped
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol jesus way to completely change what someone says to suit your agenda toxic masculinity isnt traits its social expectations of men suppressing emotions is not a trait its a social expectation men cant be raped is not a trait its a social assumption men should be strong is not a trait its a social expectation men dont want to be parents is not a trait its a social expectation i can keep going if you dont understand yet and yet it is as even when its not forced its seen as bad because one isnt showing their emotions and that being feminine which feminists want men to be because it frequently is forced men are socially engineered to suppress their emotions this leads to violent outbursts which are not good for anyone men who are taught how to handle their emotions from a young age are the ones who are the ones less prone to violence this would not affect a true stoic that article was a terrible example if you actually read it it was talking about mass killers and why so many are white and male nope blaming toxic masculinity not masculinity we use a different term toxic masculinity because its has a better definition that actually fits what the core issue is better than misandry does and yeah you will find many feminists dont really believe misandry is an issue in the us largely due to a complete misunderstanding of critical race theory which is wrongly condensed to powerprejudiceracism applied to sexism but also because many of the misandrious issues we face here root back to antifemininity eg all those things i listed before now you can argue if its antifemininity or not but at that point its semantics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you didnt even try to make a point that can be argued mens lib was still alive and well in the you can claim something doesnt exist but facts show otherwise also you didnt really compute what i said on the second point because thats not what i was saying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is it a double standard feminists arent a hive mind some feminists are shitty big surprise theyre people most wont talk over mens issues if its within their own spaces or the dialogue isnt intended to talk over women and no feminism is first and foremost about women how is it rich that the conversation is about women when the group is about women they dont act against a group who genuinely wants to help i mean shit even tumblr feminists have been helping raise awareness about male victims of abuse third wave feminism no matter the kind is intersectional radical feminists especially terf are mostly second wave
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,let me just pull out some quotes from the linked tweetstorm sexual rejection is existential rejection women hold the keys to our masculinity toxic masculinity robs men of selfdetermination by pinning selfworth identity status respect and success on acquisition of women this is not about the deficiencies of women it is about the insecurities of men toxic masculinity has men sexstarved seated squarely on the demand side of the sex economy telling women what they must do to satisfy us a rejection of toxic masculinity allows for a selfguided development of selfworth such that a boys idenity isnt a zero sum game a rejection of toxicmasculinity allows for an infinite number of ways to be male many different paths to manhood born of various values pretty clearly about men here maybe you have a wordfilter up that swaps genders and then you read this and say its all about women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres next to no feminist academia on mens issues thats where youre wrong michael kimmel has been studying and lecturing about mens issues for years hes pretty famous for it mens studies are also becoming more common as a part of sociology and gender studies too i even took an honors class on men and masculinity in college and this was almost a decade ago what youre saying is just not true
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,looking to society to make you happy is the same as denying all personal responsibility for your own happiness why are you worrying about other peoples problems if youre good with yourself people need to understand that it is not their responsibility to fix other peoples problems let them deal with their problems if you have a problem dont look to society to fix it look to fix it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as i said sometimes societal problems make life miserable so youd have to either address them or be miserable it seems like a good enough reason to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,link its on that fake site if its still up and paying staff is different from pocketing donations that people thought were going elsewhere theres a reason people were asking for an accounting of where the money was going something even kickstarters are suppose to do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its meant to be an example it was horrible thing that happened and when feminists tried to advocate against it there was pushback men fought them but they didnt give up and eventually legislation was passed against it mens rights activists should fight for the changes they want not just sit around complaining that people care about womens issues because people didnt use to care
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i guess youre advocating mgtow or something no i am advocating for male feminization if sex comes to you whatever take what you can get
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or you can just no do that and be who you are always that way when you find someone it wont be fake
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tell me how often do you discuss toxic femininity quite regularly actually in progressive circles its called female socialization and it functions the same as toxic masculinity and is despised just as much
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you havent answered my question though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know i didnt right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,see pigeon chess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is a lie
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,way to completely change what someone says to suit your agenda nope its hard to change something when literally going by what feminists say you cant even give me one example of masculinity not deemed toxic by feminists because you know very well this is true i would not be saying this if i were able to find feminists actually saying something good about masculinity i yet to find a single article or that paper from a feminist doing so i been looking for one for like years now yet to find one i doubt such a thing exists toxic masculinity isnt traits its social expectations of men then tell other feminists that then as they are saying something different as when i first learned about toxic masculinity it seemed more to me it was talking about hyper masculinity something i agree is toxic by and large but it wasnt until i started looking into and reading up on it that is when i saw feminists where going about how well nothing masculine was good but well toxic even being aggressive like approaching and asking out a woman is deemed toxic by feminists theres not a single masculine behaviortrait i yet to see not deemed toxic by feminists now if i didnt see feminists doing this i would still be at thinking toxic masculinity being more about hyper masculinity that article was a terrible example if you actually read it no it wasnt its per the course really its how feminists often bash masculinity and that white men as both are evil i probably should bother asking but i highly doubt you can show me a feminist article and not some random blog actually praising masculinity and that men as being good i doubt you can do it as well i been looking and well found next to nothing only thing i have found is feminists barely showing any empathy towards men and just understanding how sexist and man hating feminism is it be decades before this is a thing really the rate we are going we use a different term toxic masculinity because its has a better definition that actually fits what the core issue is better than misandry does no you use it because you like it when mens rights used it and hijacked it and misandry doesnt fit at all a much better fit would been hyper masculinity but feminists wont use that as well it doesnt have the same man bashing ring to it now you can argue if its antifemininity or not but at that point its semantics no its you feminists living in the past and not present and more so only having a female pov on gender issues notice how male pov arent even part of the feminist viewpoint yes i know such creatures exists but look at academia and feminist talking points its all made from female pov more so trying to pin point it on one single thing is laughable i thought you feminists where all about intersectionality these days but thats proven to be a total failure at this point mind you i agree with the thinking behind intersectionality its something i long belive to be the case but feminists rather think the world as black and white i mean for petes sake you feminists still think women have no power despite the fact they have more power than men economically in the us but you feminists are all wrapped up in traditional forms of power ie seats of power not more modern forms of power ie things like economical power
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you didnt even try to make a point that can be argued because there was no point to be made the ideas of mrm would not be welcomed into mens lib how hard is that to get things like financial abortion false rape etc would never be accepted you didnt really compute what i said on the second point i did
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is it a double standard its okay when i do it not when you do it i can link you numerous examples of feminists talking about mens issues and end up talking about womens instead seen this happening with the feminist sites i read most wont talk over mens issues if its within their own spaces or the dialogue isnt intended to talk over women thats fine and well but i dont hang out in feminist spaces and i only primary have access to feminist websites like everyday feminism or ms magazine once awhile i can get something from academia how is it rich that the conversation is about women when the group is about women its more least so coming from wave feminists claiming feminism is all about gender equality for all and not just about women thats akin to trump saying hes all about uniting the country and works to divide it more than anything see why i say its rich i know feminism is about women dont claim otherwise is my point like so many feminists want to claim third wave feminism no matter the kind is intersectional even tho its not if it was it wouldnt still think in black and white terms more so only view things from the female pov i yet to see any actual intersectionalism from wave feminism all i have seen is continuation of black and white thinking you know women have no power men have it all despite the fact otherwise something you yourself is doing i know feminism isnt a hive mind but might as well be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mens studies are also becoming more common as a part of sociology and gender studies too i even took an honors class on men and masculinity in college and this was almost a decade ago what youre saying is just not true you do realize you just proved me right right mens studies as an actual academic focus has only at most been a thing for like the past years if that i am quite aware of kimmel and is uh work i am also quiet aware feminists been barely studying mens issues in the and even but it was never a field of academics until more recently and even then its shallow and filled with holes much like academia feminism is as its from the female pov not the male pov as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but you only have to address them to yourself you have no requirement to change society the need to change society is futile if you are good with youself if youre good with yourself why worry about other peoples problems shouldnt they worry about them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its on that fake site if its still up ok link to it support your assertion and paying staff is different from pocketing donations that people thought were going elsewhere you know where it went because he told people even if this argument was once valid it obviously isnt any longer theres a reason people were asking for an accounting of where the money was going pretty much everyone wants to know where there money is going asking is not an indication that people thought the money was going elsewhere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am advocating for male feminization what the hell is male feminization
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dunno after getting fucked over a few times you kind of just get sick of that if i ever meet someone truly special ill be happy but im not gonna count on it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know whether its impossible very little is impossible i only know whats likely to happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you still havent answered my question though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is the question you want answering
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it seems exceptionally unlikely that they could go from being a to a
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,impossible scenario
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if she is a legitimate now and still maintains some of the mindset that comes from the adversity of being a and not letting her new attractiveness get to her head too much of course she could be a keeper
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id have a fun fucking a
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would finally understand why this thinks she cant do any better but seriously this could never happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,impressed who the hell wouldnt be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id probably feel a lot like the women quoted in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,both impressed because objectively that there is an achievement turned off because im fucking a former rejectfreak who likely has a lot of issues and baggage due to their smv ploletarian roots as well as some inevitable degree of genetic inferiority
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,impressed like holy shit howd you pull that off impressed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i guess morbid obesity with zero fashion sense and terrible hygiene to ripped with great style and impeccable grooming could do it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well do exist apparently though i am sure they are extremely rare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i actually know a guy whos done this hes tall and the most ripped as shit person ive met people around campus called him thor because thats what he looks like i was pretty shocked to find out on facebook that before college he was a pudgy awkward looking kid people were shocked and impressed totally different looking person these sorts of dramatic shifts do happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,despite the fact its not some people grow up being well ugly then they hit their and blossom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thank you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but what if the adversity of her being a made her angry and hate the world and it did go to her head because shes finally proving herself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,slightly impressed but i could probably care less if i were dating a girl there are probably a lot of other reasons why i am dating her that dont have to do with her appearance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,add deformity fixed by plastic surgery to that list and that is about the only way someone could gain points
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a is like deformed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a is like deformed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep that could happen too and if that were the case then i wouldnt stay with her for very long either are possible scenarios
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and when he was a baby he like cried and pooped his pants splitsville
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all men lie about their history of baby activity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she wouldnt use a guide a woman will never go from a to a just by improving her personality the only way for a woman to improve her number that much is to improve her physical appearance by leaps and bounds its all hypothetical really
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i think its completely plausible that one could be rated a without a serious physical deformity besides obesity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or morbidly obese
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which do you think is more common and what do you think would give rise to either scenario
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree but you severely underestimate girl game
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is pretty rare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,depends on where you are where i am yes being morbidly obese alone would get you a rating of in parts of the us where people tend to skew heavier and thin is rare instead of being standard doubtful is like outlandishly unattractive surely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i really cant say for sure my first reaction was what i originally wrote above so that i guess i think someone who was originally a is more likely to be the angry at the world type a is someone who had to learn her place very quickly when she was young i could be completely wrong and it would probably depend on each persons particular circumstances but this is my gut feeling
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i said it was plausible not common
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not about tearing marilyn down its about trying to drag themselves up to her level saying marilyn is hot and plussized means saying plussized can be hot a lot of it is plain ignorance monroe was a size in her time and a lot of people dont realize that dress sizes have changed a lot since then because technically monroe wore a size that now would be called plussized she became a rallying cry for people its like canon now even though its untrue she also is a bit of a bigger actress when you compare her to her contemporaries specifically audrey hepburn hepburn is probably closest to monroe in terms of fame and iconography and shes a tiny little thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trying to convince you that fat people can be pretty distracts you from the fact that fat people get winded climbing a flight of stairs which is about twenty times more unattractive than the cellulite itself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my only comment is that the idea that marilyn monroe was chunky is not at all recent i remember hearing it when i was in high school way back in the late maybe it has more traction today because of the intertubes and tumblr et al but this one has been around for a good long while
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,marilyn monroe had a higher bmi than typical runway models and would be more equivalent in body type to beyonce today there is a lot of blackandwhite thinking in todays society which is driven by the hour news cycle this is an example of black and white thinking imo its not hamstering or feminism its an eitheror mentality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no set definition but plus sized models tend to start at in modeling plus size starts well below an american size which is different to where it starts in the clothes ranges themselves and most plus size models arent actually useful for modeling plus size clothes until they are a size or yeah complicated i know a model is plus size if shes too large to just walk into a runway show and fit the size of most clothes provided as standard to runway shows if a model is a size eight or ten and gets sent to a runway show without warning the people running the show are going to be on the line to the agency asking why they got sent a plus size model however just because shes a plus size model doesnt mean shes large enough to model for plus size ranges who mostly use either a model who is the lowest size in their range or a model who is sort of about a third the way up the range of sizes they carry in terms of modern modelling terminology marilyn monroe would not have been plus size at her smallest but would have been plus size at her largest
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she may have had a inch waist but i wouldnt be surprised if she was judged by the internet today without knowing who she is there would be several people that will call her fat because a she does not have a thigh gap b she is not tall enough to look lean on camera even if she is thin most people who think thin in our technology filled era that consistently fill our heads up with images of skinny women think of this fat women are consistently being told they are fat on the internet unless they look like the above picture marilyn is a example of someone is who is realistic marilyn would not make it as a model today
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,recent if you check rrateme or something like that all the fat girls will hear that they look like monroe who was so fat maybe she was fatter later and they use those measurements but think about her thin pictures maybe its just some feel good bullshit people dont want to tell women that they should be thin if they want to be hot if they actually buy it they will defend this believe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikivanitysizing its vanity i have a hard time finding it now because nistgov national institute of standards and technology has terrible ui and recently changed but they had a history article about this matter some companies worked with the govt to get standards pushedchanged over time it played to womens vanity they liked seeing smaller numbers on their clothes some women with time on their hands found bad pics of marilyn munroe and paraded them as though she was obese marilyn munroe was far from fat this has been going on for decades its hardly recent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,totally agree this is what modern feminism tries to do tear down the surroundings instead of having agency and working hard to rise above want marilyns body dont work for it instead blame some strawmen patriarchy culture for why youre fat then try to get everyone else to validate you as a fat person by either tearing down a sex symbol like marilyn she was a fat skank or bring her down to your level as a comparison see she was fat and loved im entitled to this too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this has been going on for years i remember hearing it back in the when heroin chic models like kate moss were all the rage it will always be about making fat chicks feel like they are all good
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this meme started in the back when heroin chic was all the rage not in the modern day when the kardashian ass is in which is why it seems weird to the kids of today the pictures of her on the beach do seem jarring compared to fashion models and the look of the which is what this originally came out of also equating marilyn monroe with the haes movement and embrace natural curves is funny and not because she was actually smaller than a lot of people make her out to be its because she was a drug addict who quite possibly had an eating disorder she sure as shit wasnt healthy at any size and whatever her size it was likely influenced by the fact that she was a this body is property of hollywood type strung out on barbiturates of the time for all the body positivity movement and criticisms of it both frame themselves in health concerns once you start talking about marilyn fucking monroe youve definitely fallen out of the health issue part of the debate and into the pure aesthetic side because she made both the super calorie restricted model and the overweight body positivity campaigner look like paragons of health which is fitting considering that the amount of what is crouched as epidemiological concerns about obesity levels in the population is actually between the lines ew fatties acting like theyre people too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is behind the recent push to rebrand marilyn monroe as plus sized evil feminist agenda
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a misguided attempt at revisionist history for the purpose of identifying plus size role models for young women what we should be doing is taking the focus off of image and placing it on health and fitness instead we are telling young women its okay to be fat because men will still desire them wtf
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most people have covered the dress size issue but there is also that photo of her from when she pregnant taken at a terrible angle that emphasized her thicker waistpregnancy bloat ive seen a lot of fatty fats parade that photo around as proof that she was a real plus size womyn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wtf does this have to do with rpbp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well whats happening is that the big booty is more in fashion now girls are jealous of women who look who would be considered curvy or thick but people want women like to be considered curvy and thick
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminism is also a movement of ugly women designed to make normal pretty women feel shitty about themselves and men they prefer the reason why this promotion of ugliness has started is that feminist leadership is now no longer purely ugly man hating lesbians a bunch of ugly straight women have joined them they cant attract men so they want to shame the men into being with them marilyn monroe is like me whee like me drool over my bulging cellulite already you very good looking oppressor and you there good looking woman looking good is objectification oppression oppression feminism is a mental disease
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they are trying to alter history to fit their narrative men used to worship fat women but the evul mediuh has made it so only anorexic twigs can get male attention they believe if they keep saying it someone will start believing that marilyn monroe had a giant fupa just like them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mm was pretty but overplayed these days i like bmi girls but back in the day i had a good romp with a chuncky girl who took it six ways to sunday
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,reality is behind it you should try doing some research
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is ridiculous she was not a stick but she certainly wasnt obese
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,compared to actress and model standards she is stand her beside kate moss or jodie kidd compared to ms average she isnt but shes much more achievable and relatable than kate moss or jodie kidd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a is something like a or a now its ridiculous and marilyn monroe was just curvy very slim but she had ta she was a borderline trashy for her time vavavoom sex symbol whereas audrey hepburn and jackie o were sophisticatedly beautiful its like comparing kim kardashian to emma watson theyre totally different and theres plenty of both types to go around marilyn wasnt the only curvy girl of her day just the one who died pretty and managed to stay a household name
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not about tearing marilyn down its about trying to drag themselves up to her level saying marilyn is hot and plussized means saying plussized can be hot yep its misdirection like the clown make up and eye liner the obese seem so fond of
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont worry health at every size has this area covered
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to be fair
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i heard the same in the and back then i thought everyone was nuts truth be told shes just about my ideal for the female form but i think shed have looked better with a few more well placed pounds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the was a strange time the androgynous stick boy look was pushed relentlessly as the ideal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,now that is news all the instances i have heard is this have been maybe some in the
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,beyonce isnt even close to her she has big thighs average tits and a normal waist isnt someone like sofia vergara or sabrina ferilli more accurate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in terms of modern modelling terminology marilyn monroe would not have been plus size at her smallest but would have been plus size at her largest i dont think so at her largest her waist could still measure down to which is around a medium or size eta ooo nvm in terms of modern modelling thats what i get for not reading carefully
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she may have had a inch waist but i wouldnt be surprised if she was judged by the internet today without knowing who she is there would be several people that will call her fat because post a picture of a holocaust survivor and someone in the internet will call her fat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,recent if you check rrateme or something like that all the fat girls will hear that they look like monroe who was so fat maybe she was fatter later and they use those measurements but think about her thin pictures recent is a relative term i dont mean this year lets say in the last decade or so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep its just more of the i dont have to worry about how i look and if you dont like how i look well then youre a bigot thing thankfully there are actual measurements or clothes would never fit the actual measurements for people like her are still basically what people idealize today but beauty standards have been kinda different in the past its always some version of t and a though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,vanity sizing is even a problem for mens wear size waist pants fit fucking humongous i am a size and never can trust tag size since if i go for size it may be true to size and it fits too tight if i size up to and its vanity sizing it fits like a almost
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think definitely an increase in the proportion of overweight and obese people has contributed to the shift in clothes sizes youve got to remember that people are simply bigger now than they were in the past due to positive changes in nutrition as well the average height and respective measurements like shoulder width etc of people in western areas particularly urban areas has shifted up dramatically in the last years mainly because of our increased knowledge about nutrition and the increased availability of foods like lean meats and vegetables however much food poverty in some demographics is very much an issue still in general the way that normal people eat in urban settings has got dramatically better add to that different ideas about how women should be when previously the notion about girls was that they should eat like birds and just sit nicely or their uterus would fall out ok so im generally talking more than years but general cultural ideas about this kept going now girls are expected to play sports and eat and run around resulting in girls in particular growing taller and stronger than previously with more muscle mass i know i for one struggled with vintage clothes even in times when ive been very slim simply because they never seem to be made with the idea anyone would have been over or with wide ribcage and hips dont even get me started on the tiny shoes and then i look at the last or generations of my own family and that makes sense my generation are giants compared to them simply because we had better food and medical care growing up anyway tldr people were smaller back then not just in terms of body fat proportions which skews it all a bit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just a nitpick she doesnt look lbs and lots of speculation puts her at her heaviest also see httpthemarilynmonroecollectioncommarilynmonroetruesize
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who cares she had a dumpy body and a mediocre face
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,reality is behind it you should try doing some research im going to guess you didnt read a single one of my links and didnt get past the title prove me wrong quote the exact parts you disagree with and provide citations refuting them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is anyone calling her obese though shes curvy shes plus sized shes not skinny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,compared to actress and model standards she is objectively she isnt ill assume you ignored everything i wrote past the title and zero chance you clicked any links
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep jayne mansfield and elizabeth taylor were pretty curvy themselves especially mansfield
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hepburn is overrated mousy looking woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres a reason fat people are unattractive on various levels if theres a fire in your house and your fatass wife is too out of shape to make it up the stairs pick up both kids carry them both downstairs and get out of the house safely within an amount of time where neither she nor any of the kids pass out from smoke inhalation then shes an unfit parent if a woman cant control impulsive eating then as an employer im going to assume she also cant control impulsive internet use or impulsive behavior in front of clients and customers medical care for heart attacks and diabetes and other health issues that affect fatasses in greater proportions is expensive plus if youre fat its harder to clean yourself properly a fancy pair of shoes is not the answer less food and more exercise is the answer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,omg at the light on during the day and low tide
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if true i feel compelled to unironically say that i was born in the wrong generation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah this is a pretty old idea
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope this one goes way back probably to around the time that the clothing size shift took place and were you even alive in the late
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there was a funny article about it by nist its been going on for many decades and even has corporate support sellers want women to feel good about themselves after all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i would add sofia vergara etc to that list as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fatter people get the thinner the elite image gets because the definition of eliteness is antithetical to that which is common due to prole drift large brand name logos are considered ghetto so the brands that rich people recognize either have tiny logos or are unknown to the masses whom they consider asses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she was an hourglass though clothes that fit a size might be right for her waist but if her ta doesnt fit theyre going to have to go up a size a lot of women have this problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly thats the point the word fat get thrown at perfectly fine thin women on the internet all the time with real fat women watching that it lost its meaning women are now lashing back and can you blame them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,let me guess right about the time health at every size and fat acceptance started
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she was taller than the average woman today
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im agreeing with you kid im just explaining why people arrived at that conclusion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about that italian star sophia lauren damn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha yeah of course mansfield was practically a porn star god love her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre a healthist ableist shitlord and i love you for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a fancy pair of shoes is not the answer less food and more exercise is the answer there was a post that floated around the meta sphere not too long ago by an infamous curvy black lady who dont need no man where she disproved calories incalories out and thermodynamics by pointing out that if calories were converted to chemical energy as claimed people would shit ash since they dont qed calories have nothing to do with fat accumulation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh yes i recall the quite well i am eternal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wonder if in twenty years sophia will be remembered by some as a proud fat actress proving obesity was seen as sexy in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she is but her weight gain didnt look to be entirely uniform her usual measurements are known to be she gained some inches on her waist id say she gained only on her chest maybe on her hips since she looks more pearish at her heavier weight bylets go with jcrew since its the first one i found that puts her around a size i often find that clothes actually fit more loosely than the measurements they list though so that puts her back at an if she gained more around her chesthips than i thought she could be a that said otr clothes probably wont fit miss monroe either way everything would look wonky since theyre not designed for larger bust to waist ratios or larger waist to hip ratios either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so this whole movement which started in the nineties was to stick it to some internet troll
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a hell of a coincidence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no she wasnt she was around the average for today maybe a bit shorter depending on where you are average for us short for uk i wasnt talking about her as an individual anyway i made another post on that i meant in general
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which trailer parks are you visiting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what really says it all is that tonnes of women idolise her but ive never in my life met a man who is like omg marilyn monroe so pretty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i assume youve seen in the reddit ads right the natural look looks excellent on her imo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i could go to the supermarket and see ten girls on the way better looking than her i dont care at all that shes famous but before you think im being crass and think that women are only good for fucking i do value women being interesting and engaging and she clearly fails in that department too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you arent objectively
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it was on the tip of my tongue i kept thinking of raquel welch instead but shes the wrong era
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ha ha ha ha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive seen it argued on ppd that sophia is a fatass
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,recently a plus size model lost much weight and got death threats why because it exposes their fallacy they take a good looking fat woman compare it to an ugly thin woman and say fat people can be beautiful while the only fair comparison would be a woman fat vs the same woman thin
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no she wasnt she was around the average for today maybe a bit shorter see this is why i included sources she was average today is is greater than isnt equal to or lesser than is in fact exactly inches greater than which isnt miraculous but it is measurable and would be noticeable is this clear
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,average for us short for uk the average height for a woman in the uk is an inch less than the us do you research any of this before posting i know you have internet access
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,cool
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah sophia lauren was magnific tall beautiful classic beauty with an amazing rack and ass she still has the same figure in her lol one of my favorite models is a french girl called latitia casta she has thibk legs a big ass and big boobs shes amazing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im guessing some would call keira knightley chunky
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am fat but i dont live in a fantasy so i upvoted you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i can subtract from my sources most referred to version i could find from various google sources say she was which is some said i didnt see any that said from this year puts the average height in the uk for a woman at us sources seem to vary but be around henceforth my statement that she was average or just below for the modern day obviously it is reliant on multiple differing sources since marilyn monroe isnt here to measure and the way that the data on height is collected and average calculated will influence the result but about average is still true though again my post was a general point about size difference in terms of skeletal size and muscle mass between now and years ago and how it impacts vintage clothing not about monroe personally
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah no im really curious what you look like now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when it comes to hot old school stars my favourite was but boy did she not age well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was going to say that but then i thought she lacked tits boy was i wrong d
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think lying should be equivalent to rape however the guy who tagged in another dude without his girlfriends consent should be charged with some criminal offense she consented to sex with her boyfriend he basically let her get raped without her knowledge filming someone without their consent should also be illegal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for the most part this law applies to cases where a person has impersonated your current sex partner like your bil sneaking into your house at night pretending to be your husband in the dark in those cases i do believe that should be considered rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no it should not count as rape the logical extension of making such deceptions illegalcounting as rape is that makeup pushup bras plastic surgery etc would all be deception and thus rape as well obviously absurd and impossible to enforce that case with the strap on was not a man it was a woman posing as a man kind of fucked up but i still wouldnt be comfortable classing it as rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,deception isnt rape but if were stupid enough as a society to create laws like this pushup bras corsets spanxs hair extensions breast implants tummy tucks facelifts botox nose jobs all deceptions im sure the only deception they care about is men deceiving women though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some of these laws are a reaction to the transgendered movement iirc the case in the link of the man posing as a doctor to sexually assault a woman should be sexual assault the picture i have in my mind is a man pretending to be an ob and giving an exam that seems like a pretty clear cut case of assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre not giving very good examples op try using some from the article youre linking to instead of some guy in israel legislators cited a case in western massachusetts in which a woman consented to intercourse with her boyfriends brother because he claimed to be the womans boyfriend yeah thats rape in another case of fraud rape a lab technician posed as a medical doctor and sexually assaulted a woman again this is clearly rape what this bill makes clear is that you cannot deceive or defraud a victim into saying yes not quite sure why this is considered a bad thing it closes a loophole that exists within the current law
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is also another case in israel of a man claiming to be a neurosurgeon to be deemed more attractive to a woman so she will want to have sex with him there was also a case in israel of a palestenian boy pretending to be jewish to fuck jewish girls i read of a guy whod pretend to be douglas adams of hitchkihers guide fame to fuck chicks and of course there was the old guy in france who preteded to be a hot stud so girls let him fuck them blindfolded people just need to do their due diligence and not jump on the first dick in sight
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,think of it this way youre a hetrosexual guy you see a nice looking woman at a bar the two of you decide to go back to your place for some fun you start to take off her dress to discover she is actually a man did you consent to sex with a man when you invited that person to your bed wouldnt you be a little upset to find someone used trickery to get sex from you what if that person used a dark room sweet talk and a few drinks to get you turned on you have sex later you turn the lights on and look to see that woman has a penis did he violate your consent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only in very limited cases where say the person impersonated the victims partner for example it would be absolutely hilarious seeing rightwing bigots drag transgendered people to court for rape or men suing their wives after finding about her sordid past she denied when they got together it would fuck feminists so badly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes and no lying about your job isnt rape by deception however id consider pretending to be someones boyfriend as julio morales did to be rape by fraud
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,having sex with a woman isnt consenting to have a child can we deal with that as well fraudulent consent would also need to encompass divorce rape lying about your feelings and intentions to marry a guy soley for his wealth would need to become punishable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,depends on the situation in the two examples you gave no not rape the example of the woman who pretended to be a man in order to have sex with women using a strapon after blindfolding them yeah something that extreme i would count as at least sexual assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is just dumb it could work in reverse too women wears a padded bra would be rape by these definitions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes please and then make sure to charge women who lie about their sexual past too deception is rape then lying about past is rape or perjury too so many stories about lying about ncount or what acts they did with their exes etc please create a precedent to make those things illegal ahaha its gonna be so good
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i wrote the laws it would definitely be seen as rape if you are stealingborrowing someone elses own unique identity in order to gain consent i would also give the person whose identity was misused without consent some sort of law to give them justice they havent been raped but they have been the victim of a crime that involves them in the sex life of others without their consent it is one thing to pretend to be a neurosurgeon and quite another to pretend to be a specific neurosurgeon and generate a string of exlovers and possibly cheated on partners of those exlovers or even kids who have paternity issues out there who may land on that specific neurosurgeons doorstep
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think it should and then at the same time we should increase the spectrum of penalty for raping someone from thats harmless youre free to go to you need to die
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are fake tits botox makeup and collagen rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,first of all we need to break the word rape up into many different terms to fit the plethora of acts that it currently entails the word rape should used when force or threats are used questions of consent where no force or threats are used should be classified like a speeding violation and handled alongside traffic court this would be efficient because most of these cases probably involve a dui so they could just prosecute both at once s deception cannot be considered rape first of all there is no way to prove or enforce it in most situations it is even worse than affirmative consent if a girl lies about being on the pill and gets pregnant she can be charged as a rapist butwhat if she didnt lie and the guy just wants to get out of being a dad oh the courtroom drama the judges will have to deal with the reality is that people lie a lot in relationships courts cant mediate that lying is often subjective a woman may tell a wealthy unattractive guy that he looks good and how are courts to prove shes lying to get his money lying is shitty but it isnt illegal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only if women who wear makeup and spanx or pretend to have less crazy personalities early in the relationship are also charged with rape those women are intentionally deceptive and trying to lie to give the impression they have a higher smv via deception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you believe deception or trickery should violate consent and be treated by the law as such why or why not i dont see how we could possibly enforce that itd lead to more he saidshe said scenarios i think we do ourselves and victims a disservice when we allow the concept of rape to undergo definition creep rape is the removal or denial of a persons sexual agency there are a lot of terribly shtty things a person can do in their sex life but not all of them are rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,these laws make it sound like women the section of the population in mind when making these laws are stupid technically youre saying it is rape when a woman decided to sleep with a guy because she believed he was a secret agent who in his spare time stops cyber terrorists while using all sorts of gadgets
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure filming someone without their consent is illegal in most states but publishing it or even sharing it with others without consent is starting to be illegal in many places and i definitely agree with that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes this is really the only examples ive ever read about when the law is enforced irl to which i agree that should count as assault of some kind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some of the debate is about deceiving straight people if youre transgendered im not sure ive heard of these laws being enforced in that way in the us but apparently
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that case with the strap on was not a man it was a woman posing as a man kind of fucked up but i still wouldnt be comfortable classing it as rape would you consider it sexual assault or just a moral but not legal offense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that case with the strap on was not a man it was a woman posing as a man i dont think concealing a physical defect should count as rape say if you have a prosthetic leg instead of a prosthetic penis but arent particularly eager to highlight that fact to your partner its iffy for sure but obviously not rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all deceptions how about men who wear lifts to look taller hair plugs toupee men get tons of plastic surgery including all the ones you mentioned and more driving an expensive car and ordering bottle service at the club when they actually have no money to impress women but yes according to you only women are capable of deceptions you guys are so transparent with your sexism it really is hilarious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its different those things make women feel good about themselves and guys like to look at all of that but a lowmedium smv telling a girl hes a neurosurgeon is lame because she was trying to get some lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we havent actually made any laws like this at least not in the usa op is misrepresenting the actual wording of the law its about impersonating a specific person not lying about certain aspects of yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the case in the link of the man posing as a doctor to sexually assault a woman should be sexual assault i agree that should be a crime making up that youre a doctor to get a girl into bed is in bad taste but perfectly legal actively claiming to be a gynecologist to get your fingers in her pussy should be assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whats your opinion on the israeli man pretending to be a neurosurgeon to get sex is that rape in your opinion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why are you calling sexual assault as rape rape is non consensual sex there is no trickery involved if you consented to the activity you are getting look at the california yes means yes law it states consent only is for the act of sexual activity you are having it doesnt include anything about other terms the man pretending to be a womans boyfriend was tried on the basis of having sex with a person while asleep rape by fraud is the same thing as me sleeping with a women with fake boobs but her saying they are real i still want to have sex with her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people just need to do their due diligence and not jump on the first dick in sight what like demanding an introduction to someones rabbi before having sex with them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,none of these are rape even under rape by deception laws edit to clarify i am only referring to american laws
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so to you that scene in revenge of the nerds was totally rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id consider pretending to be someones boyfriend as julio morales did to be rape by fraud makes no logical sense how can you rape someone by fraud you cant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its the left and ultra feminist goal to redefine rape in as many ways as possible to allow women to become judge jury and execution in both their own sexuality but mens these laws are being peddled to people as protections for women when they are clearly offensive weapons for solipsistic women and unscrupulous lawyers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,read the article please what this bill makes clear is that you cannot deceive or defraud a victim into saying yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not how the law is enforced or interpreted in the usa at least its more often used in cases where someone is impersonating your romantic partner like pretending to be your boyfriend in a dark room
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is illegal if it goes beyond reasonable means to attain the footage as in if the bay windows are wide open and they are standing in there thats not really peepingtom worthy but if someone is hiding in a closet animal housing it with a ladder or other shady means than it not only is illegal to film them but also to even spy on them peeping tomism is a crime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes but beyond that this law is very dangerous it gives people the power to accuse anyone of rape if they arent getting what they want besides for sex for example a husband could be accused of rape if he doesnt wash the dishes because the wife only consented to sex because he said he would wash the dishes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont agree with affirmative consent either it just kicks the can down the road instead of fixing anything instead of he said she said whether there was consent its he said she said whether there was affirmative consent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im leaning towards just a moral offense but its really kind of tough primarily i would say moral because otherwise were starting well down the slippery slope of criminalizing any kind of deception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this wasnt concealing a physical defect it was a woman who concocted an elaborate fantasy of a caring boyfriend in order to trick her close friend into having sex with her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how about men who wear lifts to look taller hair plugs toupee men get tons of plastic surgery including all the ones you mentioned and more driving an expensive car and ordering bottle service at the club when they actually have no money to impress women but you know keep hiding your bullshit behind empty words like tons you guys are so transparent with your sexism it really is hilarious your guys are so transparent with your equalism it really is ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you mean the guys worldwide who wear lifts to look taller lol dude women spend a shit ton more on cosmetics and fashion ornaments and whatelse to become more attractive to alphas men dont really have much going for them in that regard i dont know why you always side with women you say these red pillers are sexists but you always jump at the opportunity to bring down men and push women up i know you get laid so why the white knight act
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,clear cut rape if you ask me its also rape if you pretend to be poor because you dont want her to pursue a relationship with you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my thing with this logic iswhere does it stop is it deception if you wore braces as a teen and dont divulge that fact to your partner what about using mouthwash you dont naturally have mintyfresh breath so its deceptive clipping your nails is deceptive wearing flattering clothes is deceptive blowdrying your hair gives it a different texture than if it had dried naturally so thats deceptive hell haircuts themselves are deceptive and dont even get me started on cologne we should all just be grimy unkempt and naked to avoid deceiving each other
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to be fair the original body talked about men doing the deception was offering the counterargument from the woman doing the deceiving
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,while im not in favor of expanding rape laws it should be noted that people have gotten away with this particular form of rape by just being boyfriends instead of spouses as in the law only protected you if you were married this was changed in a state
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i agree with you on that too lying about what you do in the hopes of having more sex definitely shouldnt be a crime lying about who you are on the other hand as in pretending to be an ob giving exams or pretending to be a persons partner thats rape by deception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if the woman came to the gynecologist on her own accord and requested a pelvic exam this wouldnt be assault because its not unwanted or violent this would be some sort of medical fraud think about it this way when a woman normally goes to the gynecologist she is giving medical consent for a pelvic exam she isnt giving sexual consent to any doctor regardless of hes really a doctor or not unless some extra stuff happens she is getting what she signed off for
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wheres the link
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape by fraud is the same thing as me sleeping with a women with fake boobs but her saying they are real no its not and its both hilarious and pathetic that you believe this to be the case
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the man pretending to be a womans boyfriend was tried on the basis of having sex with a person while asleep which is also rape and also was only tried that way because there wasnt a law on the books for what he actually did which there is now because of what he did rape by fraud is the same thing as me sleeping with a women with fake boobs but her saying they are real i still want to have sex with her no it would be the same thing as you telling a woman that you would only be willing to sleep with her if her boobs were real and she lied about it and if for whatever reason you really did feel that strongly about it and honestly would not have slept with her had you known the boobs were fake and she knew that and deceived you that would be comparable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,meh if the religion of casual sex partners is important to you maybe an introduction to his family and friends visit his home see an id card
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes why not if them being jewish is so important to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a fair private solution to the matter rather than feckless womanchildren demanding the government solves all their problems for them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the israeli one is i believe since it occurred in israel
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes under these laws we are discussing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,absolutely and it makes it uncomfortable to watch what used to be one of my favorite movies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the consent was fraudulently obtained thats what rape by fraud means
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because she didnt consent to sex with him he admitted that he knew she thought he was her boyfriend if dave says hes a ceo but is really a bus driver id still have consented to sex with dave if dave comes into my bedroom at night and initiates sex with me while im sleeping knowing i think hes my bf bob then its rape because i havent consented to sex with dave
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,padded bras are deception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure why not since women commit domestic violence at the same rate as men charge them too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no deception there nothing is being hidden people feel and act different ways at different times
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wasnt thinking of that i was thinking of having a camera in your private residence or car or something not purposely spying on others
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no youre misunderstanding the law at least the way its worded in the usa people call it rape by deception but its more like rape by impersonation in california its worded like this rape is where a person submits under the belief that the person committing the act is the victims spouse and this belief is induced by any artifice pretense or concealment practiced by the accused with intent to induce the belief not doing to dishes or lying about your job has nothing to do with it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also not getting what you want or someone not meeting your expectations isnt fraud in any legal sense here in the us
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no way that would be considered rape by deception in the us the laws are pretty narrowly worded iirc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but youre not denying that men get lots of plastic surgeries nor are you denying that men lie about their height dick size and bank accounts in order to try and get women according to you these are all deceptions correct and yet you only bring up deceptions that women are supposedly guilty of odd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know you get laid so why the white knight act you really cannot conceive of a situation in life where a guy would simply support women without wanting something in return can you i have been successful with women and as a result i hang around them a lot all my closest friends are women and only some of them i have sex with i see the shit they go through on a daily basis and its been very educational i also have a mother and a daughter and the thought of them getting disrespected really pisses me off
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so a man lies to you about being a doctor so that he can get you into a compromising position and rape your ass and thats not rape to you seriously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,clipping your nails isnt deceptive you now have shorter nails
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what this bill makes clear is that you cannot deceive or defraud a victim into saying yes are you defrauding a person into having sex with you by not mentioning your braces think about it before you answer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,apples and oranges his poor counterargument stems from a misuse of the word deception if he actually read the article he would see that it is much more deviant and criminal than fake tits
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep recently changed in california after the julio morales case im not sure if tennessee specifies spouse or not but they also have this law edit i should clarify i didnt mean we dont have rape by deception laws in the us just that they in no way have the scope or definition that op is giving them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,surely it would depend on the motivation if it were for sexual gratification it would be a sex crime if it were purely for monetary gain it would be fraud
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if the woman came to the gynecologist on her own accord and requested a pelvic exam this wouldnt be assault because its not unwanted or violent this would be some sort of medical fraud its quackery
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,unless some extra stuff happens she is getting what she signed off for nooooo shes not shes allowing someone to poke around inside her to make sure shes healthy and give her medical advice based on what they seefind someone who isnt a doctor can poke around sure but isnt actually trained and any observations they make are going to be dubious at best what if shes showing early signs of cervical cancer and it goes untreated because some asshole just wanted to put his fingers in her vagina what the hell do you think women go to the gynecologist for fun
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was unable to find what op was talking about but say philip disguises himself as a neurosurgeon he gets sex because megan finds him attractive was megan raped
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one of the articles linked in my op stated a women accusing a man of rape because he used a prosthetic penis to penetrate her even though he led her to believe it was real breast implants are a prosthesis to enlarge the appearance of the breasts your confirmation bias is visible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uh where did i say anyone should be jailed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know exactly nothing about israeli rape laws and cant speak to that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was more interested in people personal opinion rather than legal technicalities
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fact that she enjoys it and becomes his girlfriend doesnt make it less uncomfortable for you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which is illogical how can it be fraudulently obtain when in actuality consent was not obtain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as you even said its rape because there was no consent not because of fraud
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think this is a gray area because its hard to say that he knew you thought it was his brother i can easily see it happening but i cant see how you would really know that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what this bill makes clear is that you cannot deceive or defraud a victim into saying yes are you defrauding people by wearing a padded bra i mean in a criminal way think about it before you answer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if its in the videotapers residence it is not illegal if it is in a place that has a reasonable expectation of privacy a bathroom for example it is illegal this is why home surveillance is not illegal adding audio complicates things and i think this varies from state to state
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but youre not denying that men get lots of plastic surgeries nor are you denying that men lie about their height dick size and bank accounts in order to try and get women according to you these are all deceptions correct and yet you only bring up deceptions that women are supposedly guilty of odd im saying that the word lots in this context is bullshit it has no meaning and this fact is exactly why you used it women get the overwhelming majority of plastic surgery your usage of lots here is the real deception because by any objective measure they dont youre using it explicitly to mean any quantity larger than zero to draw attention away from the truth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only women get nose jobs i think youre jumping at shadows
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are talking about the hollywood movie stars not men as a whole worldwide i dont see shaving my face everyday and applying cologne to be tricking women lol but good luck getting out of the house and seeing a woman who is years old without layers of war paint a pushup bra lingeriethongs under her pants that somehow always find a way to show itself etc etc their white teethi s a result of teeth whitening their straight teeth is a result of braces their beauty is mostly fake
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not just a situation you take the womans side of the time there is never anything wrong with women with you there is never a situation when a woman fucks up its always the mans fault its always the mans fault for wanting sex its always the mans fault for seeing how easy women have it etc yes and i also hang out a lot with women most of my friends are women and i also see the amount of shit they are up to and what they make men go through but that must just be my group of women women in general cannot be possibly like that well maybe you should start doning a blue and red suit and start saving all them fair maidens
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i should have said manicuring or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was being facetious im in agreement with you about the ridiculousness of the makeup and boob jobs are deceptive argument
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is much more to it sure but there is still the one aspect of deception which is claiming to be of a higher status than you are and that was talked about in the article and in ops opening paragraph it seems like was addressing those specifically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so if an actual licensed gynecologist derives sexual gratification from his medical exams performed without impropriety would you consider that a sex crime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes allowing someone to poke around inside her to make sure shes healthy and give her medical advice based on what they seefind someone who isnt a doctor can poke around sure but isnt actually trained and any observations they make are going to be dubious at best exactly thats called practicing medicine without a license what if shes showing early signs of cervical cancer and it goes untreated because some asshole just wanted to put his fingers in her vagina what the hell do you think women go to the gynecologist for fun bingo thats the point woman are going to a gynecologist for medical checkups its accepted that the poking around or pelvic exams is a nonsexual activity so its ridiculous to call this sexualassault given that its not a sexual situation its simply practicing medicine without a licensedegree which is a different crime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no and that is not what the law is saying either what this bill makes clear is that you cannot deceive or defraud a victim into saying yes those were some pretty precise examples given to describe the precedent that needs to be met legislators cited a case in western massachusetts in which a woman consented to intercourse with her boyfriends brother because he claimed to be the womans boyfriend much more heinous than the example you propose with lying about your profession in order to try and impress people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have never been fucked by tits and weirdly some people object to having things jammed into their bodily orifices without their consent let me ask you this a woman consents to sex with a man he suddenly reveals that he wants to fuck her with a dildo woman says no she doesnt want that he forces the dildo into her against her will is that rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you talking about the article where gayle newland a woman was pretending to be a man in order to have sex with her unsuspecting friend thats not the same as a man using a prosthetic penis
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where did i i genuinely think that consulting a religious leader professor or gypsy fortune teller is a fair solution for those of us who care enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all i know is what is on wikipedia
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my personal opinion is that that scene would be rape by deception because iirc the guy impersonated her bf are you asking whether i personally believe this should or shouldnt be illegal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it helps a little but the scene itself is still pretty squicky the panty raid i can at least put into historical context but the funhouse rape scene is still just that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if a man sneaks into a womans house and has sex with her when shes sleeping where she thinks its the husband she gives consent to a man who is a fraud pretending to be the husband consent is technically obtained but for the wrong person
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats the whole point its not truly consent of it was fraudulently obtained the fraud vitiates the consent in a legal sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes saying theres no consent to sex with that specific person not no consent to the act itself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in that particular case he admitted it but there was an issue in the beginning because she wasnt married to her boyfriend and the law referred to husband
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course not in a criminal way but using a prosthetic penis or lying about your occupation is not defrauding someone in a criminal way either which is my point this law is utterly moronic and will lead to a helluva lot more trouble than any good to come out of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right thats what i was talking about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do men get the overwhelming number of hair restoration surgeries i would assume they do is that not a cosmetic surgery how far down this rabbit hole do you want to go before you admit that men are just as guilty of the deceptions you accuse only women of
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you take the womans side of the time there is never anything wrong with women with you there is never a situation when a woman fucks up lets be clear here on ppd red pill guys post outrage porn about how terrible women are its the extreme stuff zomg feminists think men should die feminists think all men are rapists so i naturally counter that bullshit in real life i watch women fuck up all the time when i sit with women i know and we complain about the bitches we know i call them bitches and i call the guys assholes you dont know me in real life so you never see this side of me i think if you ask around youll find quite a few rp guys that i have found common ground with it just so happens that my common ground does not include sexist rhetoric
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shit i just realized i misread your response i thought you were being snarky i apologize
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill believe that when i see it as far as i know you might be the first man in history to make that argument
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is still the one aspect of deception which is claiming to be of a higher status than you are what explain this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,today on people who have no concept of nuance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant tell if youre trolling or not if someone lies about being a gynecologist so that he can penetrate a womans vagina under false pretenses that is obviously sexual assault
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know whether you have heard but there was a very similar case to your dildo example in manchester england there was also a deception where the victim gave consent to have sex with a real penis but the perpetrator was a woman google gayle newland
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that situation has absolutely nothing to do with rape by deception thats forced penetration if an objection occurs its non consensual this law has to do with consent is given see this law is so fucked up you cant wrap your mind around it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no im asking more if you think it would be justice if he was charged for rape if she consented after the mask was off and became his girlfriend i know its fiction movie but it does represent one of the fine lines this law toes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i do get that but also i think the movie was trying to show that if the hot girl gave the nerd a chance she would be more satisfied it was definitely a crude scene that couldnt be made today blazing saddles couldnt be either but for some reason it doesnt creep me out like that because she did like it and become his gf
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,was the scene in revenge of the nerds rape can a girl consent after the fact as she did in the movie thus nullifying the deception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape by fraud she doesnt seem to be saying that but was rape by deception which doesnt count as rape the lack or no consent does count as rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,without the new legislation police and prosecutors are virtually helpless when someone reports a rape that occurred because the victim was deceived or tricked into consenting legislators cited a case in western massachusetts in which a woman consented to intercourse with her boyfriends brother because he claimed to be the womans boyfriend i dont think you understand the limits of the law you need to go and actually read the article
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do men get the overwhelming number of hair restoration surgeries i would assume they do is that not a cosmetic surgery yes and it is a included in the previously posted statistic how far down this rabbit hole do you want to go before you admit that men are just as guilty of the deceptions you accuse only women of sure keep attempting to wave your hands and convince me that theres an equitable distribution between the sexes and ill keep pointing back to the hard numbers that say otherwise i never once said that only women deceive i said that the only deceptions that anyone pushing for laws about deception care about criminalizing are those perpetrated by men on women now what i did say is that women do the lions share of decieving and then and this is the real kicker i actually linked to tangible proof that this is the case whereas you have continued on with this nuh uh this one time this one guy did it therefore its the same and youre sexist because potato
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where do you live that men get huge amounts of overwhelming number of hair restoration surgeries lol i see so many bald guys and even guys in their balding already for me to bother believing theres a huge amount of guys getting hair restoration surgery do they also have youthrejuventation therapies going now when i look at at a year old guy am i really looking at a year old man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in actual legal terms i think the courts should work on a basis of greater good if you impersonate a medical professional to conduct some sort of intimate examination for sexual gratification or pretend to be someones partner in the dark of night to procure consent it should be classed as rape if a woman denies that she had a threesome when in actual fact there was this one time in college it should not be a criminal matter
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,faking your job title your personal wealth your possessions in order to seem more desirable the ops intro mentioned a case like this when heshe wrote there is also another case in israel of a man claiming to be a neurosurgeon to be deemed more attractive to a woman so she will want to have sex with him even though its not mentioned in the article seemed to focus primarily on this aspect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know what my opinion is on this but what is yours
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if she consented to his penis but not the dildo then fucking her with the dildo is rape how does that not make sense to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you never read the article did you the answer to your question is in the second paragraph under current law rape in massachusetts can only be prosecuted if the act involves force and nonconsent the law does not protect victims who have been intentionally duped into having sex without force or violence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,technically i would still consider it rape but the fact she consented after the fact means there wouldnt be a complaining witness and the case would likely never see the light of day the movie is a movie and a comedy no less so its not realistic i find it hard to believe many women would laugh off a man impersonating their partner to have sex with them and then start dating him irl i dont see this as a realistic situation likely to arise frequently irl i dont see this as a fine line
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i get what they were trying to convey and in the context of the era it was made i can see why no one thought it was that big of a deal if the movie was made today there would be ways it could be done that would be more acceptable and basically do the same thing its just extra uncomfortable for me because i am personally particularly focused on consent issues of course it couldnt be made today because nerds as portrayed no longer really exist geek has become chic and nerds get more respect than they used to and bullying of nerds is less tolerated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes it was absolutely rape she consented to sex with her boyfriend not sex with just anyone therefore its rape except rape as defined by law requires the victim to consider it rape consent cant be retracted after the fact contrary to what many trps and mras claim but it can be granted retroactively at the sole discretion of the victim at which point theyre not i wouldnt rely on it though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes it was i suppose consent can be given after or in a broader sense she can essentially say shes now fine with it but it doesnt mean it wasnt rape or deception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape by fraud and rape by deception are interchangeable different states and countries use different terms for the same thing its also sometimes called sex by trickery
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i already read the article my point is if the law is applied to examples in the op like lying about your job then the law is bullshit imo obviously the case of the assistant assaulting the women in dental office is rape but the prosthetic penis and lying about career should absolutely not be rape
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never once said that only women deceive all the things you listed were done by women know lots of men that wear corsets or get fake tits now what i did say is that women do the lions share of decieving and then and this is the real kicker i actually linked to tangible proof that this is the case you are misunderstanding the term deception as used in the legal sense when crafting this law what this bill makes clear is that you cannot deceive or defraud a victim into saying yes that is not at all the same as fake tits get your facts straight and come back
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,totes agree very well said if a woman denies that she had a threesome when in actual fact there was this one time in college it should not be a criminal matter im confused was this ever considered a real crime by anyone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,such a brave troll
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,link to the case is there any reality to this i think this would fall more under the case of a guy faking wealth to bang some hot mail order russian brides and then hope they like him after his deception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gayle or this post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because the woman in that example from the article agreed to have sex while blindfolded and never said anything about it also there is no legal literature specifying consent with specific terms consent to vaginal penetration is consent to the act itself if you can find anything that contradicts this let me know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,let me ask you this a woman consents to sex with a man he suddenly reveals that he wants to fuck her with a dildo woman says no she doesnt want that he forces the dildo into her against her will did you not just use the term forced here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,consent cant be retracted after the fact contrary to what many trps and mras claim nobody claims that consent can be retracted after the fact what they do claim is that consent can be given at the time and then lied about after which obviously can happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,would you consider it justice if he ended up being charged for rape even if she consented once she found out the truth and became his girlfriend as happens in the movie
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape by fraud and rape by deception are interchangeable which doesnt criminally fall under it being raped from your own link morales was found guilty on march of rape of an unconscious person meaning they couldnt give consent to sex the mans lawyer found an obtuse legal loophole
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my point is if the law is applied to examples in the op like lying about your job then the law is bullshit imo it doesnt and its not bullshit lying about career should absolutely not be rape agreed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all the things you listed were done by women so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some redpillers if you see this thread
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all im pointing out is the situation that op posted possibly prompting response thats it im not here to argue one side or the other im pointing out a possible explanation aside from rampant sexism for why responded the way he did but to answer your question if there is reality to this that kind of thing happens just about every day on both sides of the coin
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gayle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,consent to a specific act is not consent to all acts if you consented to sex with a woman and she shoved a baseball bat in your ass thats rape right so if she consented to sex with you and your penis and you shove a rubber dong in her thats rape she didnt consent to being penetrated by that dildo just by you the blindfold is completely irrelevant consent is still consent even if you cant see
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you agree that is rape even tho they have already had consensual sex good heres the issue police and prosecutors are virtually helpless when someone reports a rape that occurred because the victim was deceived or tricked into consenting so then what happens when someone intentionally tricks someone into consenting when they would not have consented willingly had they known the truth is that not rape as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lots of people in this very sub claim that the new affirmative consent laws or other new laws allow consent to be retroactively retracted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how could he be charged for rape if she doesnt report it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rape is where a person submits under the belief that the person committing the act is the victims spouse and this belief is induced by any artifice pretense or concealment practiced by the accused with intent to induce the belief colloquially referred to as rape by deception tennessee has a similar law this legislation is being considered in massachusetts but has yet to pass
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well i wouldnt have thought a law could allow some ambulance chaser to sue mcdonalds over coffee either but the happened
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so so men dont deceive or you just conveniently forgot to mention that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i believed gayle until last month i was positive the victim made up this whole story because she was ashamed of her sexuality especially since she wasnt a virgin so i cant understand to this day how did she not notice the difference im not a woman so i cant tell whether you can feel the shafts play in the skin but a strapon has the same rigidity the whole time the penis does not have constant rigidity it gets harder goes softer twitches pulses not to mention ive never heard of a dildo which can be heated constantly to get the feeling of a real one other reason was i did not believe her because no sane person agrees to have sex with someone she never met while wearing a blindfold not to mention for five times so until last month i was sure that an innocent woman was sent to prison because of a lunatics feelings and insecurities then i have read that gayle sent her many apology emails which interestingly did not hit the news back in it was a media hype imo the media is not interested in informing it is interested in hysteria if it serves them they throw people under the bus if it serves them they might save other people your opinion on gayle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i consented to being anally penetrated with a woman that would not be rape your not reading this law right this law is talking about situations where consent is already deemed present and knowing this is not talking about non consensual situations as i said before you cant even wrap your mind around how screwed this law is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you cant be tricked into consenting see you said yourself that consent is for a specific sexual act its stated by many feminists and laws that consent for one act doesnt imply anything else or any other acts if two people give consent for some sexual act and they proceed in doing that sexual act they are getting what they consented for do you think transgender people should be charged with rape of they have sex with someone without stating or revealing they are not the gender they appear to be sexually
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have not once seen anyone claiming that consent can literally legally be given and then retracted after the fact it has always been in the context of giving consent and then later lying about it if you can find otherwise please link
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the movie hypothetically someone else like the boyfriend could have reported it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men do deceive but not nearly in the proportion your lots was intending to convince me of in this context it is overwhelmingly women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well in the context of the law that is being debated it is overwhelmingly men who are the offenders if you open up the meaning of deception to the absurd so as to include things like makeup you are well outside the meaning or intention of this law
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well in the context of the law that is being debated it is overwhelmingly men who are the offenders if you open up the meaning of deception to the absurd so as to include things like makeup you are well outside the meaning or intention of this law absolutely right because as ive already said the only deception anyone cares about is the type men perpetrate on women the intent is very clear women can deceive men and thats just the way of the world but zomg shitlord rapejail if the opposite occurs tldr the law has nothing to do with actual deception and everything to do with men deceiving women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the things that you listed as deception are not in line with the definition of deception as used in that law what this bill makes clear is that you cannot deceive or defraud a victim into saying yes fake tits and make up do not defraud men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the things that you listed as deception are not in line with the definition of deception as used in that law exactly the law is explicitly written to make illegal the particular ways in which men deceive women is this still not sinking in ive said it a few times now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have not demonstrated that women are defrauding men into consenting to sex when they otherwise would have said no how many times do i need to explain it what this bill makes clear is that you cannot deceive or defraud a victim into saying yes i never would have fucked her if i knew she was wearing makeup said no guy ever do you understand how ridiculous you sound
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never would have fucked her if i knew she was wearing makeup said no guy ever you have zero male friends if i had a nickel for the number of times ive heard when i got her back to my place and took her bra off her tits were gone or she looked terrible the next morning without makeup i regret hooking up with her id have a shitload of nickels do you understand how ridiculous you sound do you youre at the point where youre just running around screaming and waiving your arms in the hopes that you can distract people from realizing women are deceptive the levels of white knightery are absurd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre at the point where youre just running around screaming and waiving your arms in the hopes that you can distract people from realizing women are deceptive the levels of white knightery are absurd falling back on meaningless red pill rhetoric when are you going to really really win this thing and call me a cuck cmon you know you want to if i had a nickel for the number of times ive heard when i got her back to my place and took her bra off her tits were gone or she looked terrible the next morning without makeup i regret hooking up with her regret sooooo not what the article is talking about go back and read it and try again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tells me im falling back on meaningless red pill rhetoric then delivers this when are you going to really really win this thing and call me a cuck cmon you know you want to classic projection
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,at its core i think they want a sense of power or agency over their dating life they want to have their pick of women not have to settle and be able to have standards they want to choose whether they have casual sex or a relationship and not have to commit because they have no other option to get sex they want a real justified abundance mentality where they dont have to feel desperate or intimidated by attractive women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,everyone has their own plans and motives for trp some guys are in their just trying to move on from shitty divorces and experiences with women some are college kids who want to get laid others want to get advice on being confident and charismatic while others want to learn ideas on how to kill their anxiety around women or just in general
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in theory provide men with a place where they can speak openly and honestly if hyperbolically about women and their experience in dating a place where they can receive frank actionable advice to take ownership of their lives re op some people get lucky they have good models for sociosexual relationships and find relationships without too much angst others of us are not that lucky
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp gives you the tools to do what you want you want to hookup theres info on that you want an ltr theres info on that and yes marriage is looked down upon due to the nature of how much women are favored and eliminates the man ability to easily walk away but theres still a whole sub on how to be a man in your marriage and make it as favorable for you as it possibly can be and again just because its working nicely for you doesnt mean that most other guys are not going to get screwed by most women if they dont keep their composure also known as frame it applies for you as well just because trp can produce some temporary angry guys doesnt mean trp is inherently wrong or bad it is simply the truth given to you and you decide how to act on it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is no set goal its just a bunch of observations about human sexuality anybody can use that information to achieve their personal goals or modify it for their desired lifestyle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what do they imagine their life like at years old after watching my grandparents go through bouts of cancer and dementia im cool with ramping up the extreme sports in my to make sure i dont see my im fully aware that skipping ltrs for plates injectable supplements sportbike wheelies on the highway and killing my knees and back with heavy squatsdls isnt a great long term plan not but i dont see a point to reducing how much i can enjoy myself now to make my adult diapers years a more comfortable prospect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont want to get married or have kids i am not adverse to an ltr though to me not getting married is simply due to statistics most marriages end in divorce and in a divorce it is usually the man who gets shafted as common law marriage doesnt exist where i live i can get the benefits of marriage without the legal shitstorm if it all goes tits up as it is likely to do as for kids i just dont like them that much i can put on an act for them in short doses but i like being able to hand them back to their parents when they start being a nuisance or just grating on me i am also acutely aware that as i get older im not wanting marriage and kids will exclude me from most ltrs where most people will have kids already or want them very quickly but in general my lifes goal is to just enjoy it do what i want when i want and not worry about it in the last years of my life i cant think of a happier time in my life than now i dont put my happiness in the hands of anyone but myself and i dont feel the need for a woman in my life to make me happy so to me trps end goal is simply waking enough men up to the fact that theyre responsible for their own life and happiness and that you dont need an ltr you dont need kids and you dont need marriage to be happy married people are statistically happy yes but i think that statistic is skewed by societies expectations that you need marriage and to pair off societal pressure on singletons of both genders is what makes them unhappy as opposed to being single and unattached imo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fuck bitches get money
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for me it was always ltr
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,writing blog posts and getting books published to monetise trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do they want to just do that the rest of their lives though what do they imagine their life like at years old if they dont want to get married then do they also not want a longterm relationship minus the marriage part do they not want kids its not a religion its not meant to dictate the direction of your entire life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,depends on the man most just want to fuck around right now some want an ltr or kidsmarriage when theyre older some dont some are already older and just want to fuck around again or find a good ltr for fun trp just helps men with women theres no prescribed goal men do what they want
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am not trp but i think it is about having as much sex as often as they want with as many women as they want if they are straight dudes while not experiencing any problems drama percieved shaming and for this to continue indefinitely if they do not want an ltr or marriage and then when they change their minds about that they want to lock down a high quality low n count woman who submits to them sees them as a leader and gives them sex as often as they of the exact sex quality they want indefinitely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,get laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whats the end goal of a mechanic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to not get married i still enjoy having a decent gf around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,think about how shitty packed to the brim the old folks homes are going to be when all of these childless losers actually lose their minds and have no support or legacy to give them a dignified end life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i found trp about years ago believe it or not and basically what happens is you outgrow it i studied it like the bible i pushed myself to do stupid shit like cold approaching and being alfalpha i pulled some hot girls and got to feel like the man like that time i pulled a girl from the club in this big group and all the guys where like wow man howd you do it or the time friends would walk into the study room at uni like dont sit there i fucked a girl there last night no dont sit there either then there was some extremely cringey moments like when i was doing cold approach drills and asked a girl do you know where the chemist is yea you asked me this yesterday or the time i spent an entire day and rented out a camera to get the perfect tinder selfie i graduated got a really good job and having a dedicated and loving girlfriend trp has nothing to say about making money or doing anything really beyond fuk some sluts so the end game is you graduate from trp you go out into the world with a new perspective on life and yourself you shed those insecurities you had and are able to be free and choose where to go with your life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,get laid get paid the base things in life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp itself doesnt have an end goal its just a sexual strategy individual rpers have a wide variety of life goals for me personally the absolute ideal situation would be a ltr but not marriage with a really cool chick with a good attitude who doesnt care if i fuck around with hot girls in their and fucking around with hot year olds is easy finding a cool chick with a good attitude is the hard part
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fuck women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this terpers want what women have in the smvrmv without all the downsides of being a woman they want what everyone would choose to have if they had the choice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,correct most men just want the options most women have by default
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yup and this is the shittt part about the irrational hate towards it guys who come from single parent homes are literally set up to fail in almost every area of society and the most likely to be disregarded and humiliated thats where i think a lot of the anti pc stuff comes from its like who are these entitled feminists on the internet to judge someone who has been dealt a shit hand in life without a roadmap full of suffering for trying to improve themselves they assume every guy is some sexist pig in reality many are just tired of getting walked over and left empty handed a lot of people dont realize without things like redpill a lot of guys would just suffer in silence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im with this my grandfather came down with parkinsons and the toll it took on him and my grandmother made me realize id rather fly off the road into a tree trying to do my best colin mcrae impression
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,meh being a gramps might actully be dope mine has a harem plays guitar while collecting ss and smokes joints everyday living in a shack on the river but if you have no legacy then youre correct
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fuq niggas they funny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre actually describing feminism to the point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think most of trp knows they will never have the options of women but want the options of attractive men whos options arent as good as womens but still better than mens
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is it just me or does it seem like a lot of it is from poor or economically disadvantaged guys its a large factor if your parents are well off financially that typically is a predictor of healthy behaviors in other ways say it a different way there are no wealthy single moms or single dads single parents cant accrue enough capital to be stable in the same way that two parent households can i would say that above of the guys who come to trp comes from low ses households lots of products of singlemoms and unwanted harried beta dads who get divorced anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp believes in the rule where of women only datesleep with the top most attractive men this leads to the remaining of men to compete with each other for the remaining of women the odds are heavily stacked against the average man in finding love sex etc while the average woman has the opposite problem too many options so they go for the hottest guy as udakru said the men of trp want to change this they want the same power and choices in datingsex life that women have trp teaches men how to enter the exclusive club that is the top
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is this different than what i said i think were agreeing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just providing a deeper insight
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like the clothing more i dislike feeling unsafe the beauty standards the pressure and the list goes on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,knowitalls are irritating as hell especially when they dont know what the fuck theyre talking about but its not an especial gendered thing the same men mensplain other men all the time we just tell them to shut the fuck up instead of whining about structural sexism on the internet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the whole concept on mansplaining is stupid to me way to make an issue out of nothing no one likes to be interrupted or to have someone be condescending but lets not make a whole gender issue out of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,funny i was thinking about this the other day after one of my friends posted something about mansplaining one thought i had was that women like men who are competent so men have learned to act knowledgeable and confident because its adaptive ie it leads to rewards in life there are plenty of things that are termed mansplaining that might be very attractive if a girl didnt know the subject at hand ohh he knows what hes talking about another thought was that throughout history women have taken up the majority of childrearing and as a result men tended to rise to the top of most every profession afterall women are dividing their time between handing children and maybe having a career whereas men can focus more directly on career as a result men tended to be more competent than women so it became common for men to view themselves as more competent than women i do think its weird though that the same people who complain about gendered slurs slut bitch pussy etc seem to have no problem using gendered slurs against men im sure that in their view gendered slurs are justified if the insult is justified plus it feels good emotionally to slam someone for behavior you dont like of course the its the truth justification is exactly the justification a racist would use to legitimize racial slurs i wouldnt call them if they didnt act like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,isnt the original definition referring to when a man interrupts a woman did they change it to explaining something in a demeaning way the problem with the word is that it applies a gender aspect when a very good of mansplaining is coming from a guy who would have done it to males also its just an attempt to silence people many people just love to argue assume they are smarter than you and love to hear themselves talk jumping to the conclusion that its because they are sexist is just silly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never understood the issue with mansplaining until i was repeatedly trpsplained now i get it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mansplaining happens because women are given affirmative action jobs that they do not deserve did not earn and do not know how to do add in to that that weve completely refigured the education system to play to womens strengths such as sitting still doing what they are told and regurgitating the things that they were told then they get upset because for some reason everyone assumes that they are less competent than they believe they are so going by feminism insanity the solution is clearly to just shut the men down with more shaming language since we all know that women arent going to actually earn what they have
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im almost positive that what youve described is why some guys feel the need to slowly and condescendingly explain stuff to women who dont need an explanation but that doesnt make it okay or not annoying that being said the term mansplaining gets overused to the point where people now dismiss it out of hand because its been misused so many times it means a pretty specific thing and younger feminists dont seem to have a grasp on what it originally meant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is it like vagsplaining
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think the concept of mansplaining has anything to do with some evolutionary biotruth i think it is purely a cause of annoyance for women to have their experiences reframed whether or not you think the experience itself requires reframing is a different argument but i think the concept has only gained ground because women control the social narrative if you attempting to coin womansplaining youd be hard pressed its essentially a social bullying tactic to dismiss criticism of unreasonable opinions or blatantly agenda based contentions of modern cultural norms
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive seen the word used in the context of men explaining to women how the male libido works so apparently its not just about men explaining things they dont experience directly like periods or childbirth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,imo its just pure projection when feminists use the term assuming complete ignorance on the part of anyone that disagrees with them is their favorite thing to do so accusing others of doing the same first is their diversion tactic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i mean i think it just refers to when a man tries to give information that he could not possibly have ie what it feels like to go through a pregnancy thats why women get angry when groups of men decide on womens reproductive health issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres also another term called transplaining which is when trannies attempt to educate you on the make belief notion of transgenderism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i hate the term mansplaining too easily misused expertise is a mans tool that he uses to fulfill his gender role and deliver value for the woman nah everyone gets annoyed when someone explains something to them that doesnt need explaining like a pompous boss to an employee like a white person explaining to a black person how racism feels to black people like a woman explaining to a man how it feels to kicked in the nuts likewise a man is not delivering either expertise nor value when he explains something to a woman that she doesnt need the explanation for she just thinks hes a dumbshit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can anyone explain why mansplaining is a politically correct statement but jewsplaining or blacksplaining probably are not isnt it possible for a black person or a jew to begin a conversation with an inaccurately low assessment of the interlocutors previous knowledge about swahili or the torah for example hey dont blacksplain me about swahili i know the language better than you think i dont approve of people saying mansplaining jewsplaining or blacksplaining the words are equal although two of them i just invented
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great post bromance nice breath of fresh air around here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mansplaining is just an ignorant bigoted term that intends to associate a universal negative with a particular class it is just like jewing down or blackbuying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the concept of mansplaining only exists because mras act like whiny bitches they want to gain the same protection as feminists and women are quite understandably turned off by that disgusting behaviour its like that big red feminist video she only starting acting out of hand because the mras tried to engage her on a rational level arguing from rationality is weakness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think mansplaining exists and i dont think a standard gendered form of explainingexists either anyone would be annoyed at someone overexplaining everything all the time and there are just as many women and men that are know it all overexplainers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wtf is the standard gendered form of explaining
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no mansplaining is a result of feminist ovaryacting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pretty much this men are generally a bit more confident in telling other people to fuck off women just sit and bitch about it later which is fine but dont complain about it happening to you when you could easily solve it by following the example of men yes this is a big generalisation and it probably comes down to your sizepostureconfidence moreso than gender but its a noticeable trend
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,know nothings who think they are know it alls are even more irritating
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i do think its weird though that the same people who complain about gendered slurs slut bitch pussy etc seem to have no problem using gendered slurs against men they have a magic getoutofjail card such issues are only an issue if they are directed towards a marginalized underprivliged group women racial minorities sexual minorities etc anything can be said towards white heterosexual men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are plenty of things that are termed mansplaining that might be very attractive if a girl didnt know the subject at hand ohh he knows what hes talking about the whole point of the term mansplaining when used correctly is that the woman does know about the subject at hand and the man either automatically assumes she doesnt because she is a woman or refuses to believe it even when she has shown she does if a man or woman has lets say a phd in meteorology and i dont then explaining something about how we predict the weather to me is just an interesting conversation with someone who knows more than me no one will be annoyed by that unless they have made it clear they dont want to talk about it but if i have a phd in meteorology and the person im talking to is a sports writer and they start explaining the weather to me even though they know about my phd im going to be a bit confused about why theyre doing it and annoyed there is an important difference there that i think anyone can understand its funny because i told my boyfriend about what mansplaining is and the context in which it happens men thinking women are less knowledgable and what they have to say is less important the other day we were at the pub with some guys we know on the way home he was like you know that thing we were talking about the other day i never picked up on it before but that one guy was totally doing it he also kept talking over you and saying things that youd already said as if no one had said them yet or you werent part of the conversation i was like yeah that happens thats why its good to have a term for it it has to be gendered because it refers specifically to something men do to women not being a patronising ass in general which is also a thing it means that people who might otherwise not pick up on it happening so men who dont do it but dont really think about it either can understand what we mean
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,man isnt a slur if it was called cocksplaining thatd be a gendered slur
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes it is just another excuse to bash men we have all encountered someone who cuts us off speaks dismissively assumed you dont know anything acting like it is a male thing is just one more thing to ignore when it comes to the whole modern narrative weve got going on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no you dont let me explain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,elaborate please
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,boom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,add in to that that weve completely refigured the education system to play to womens strengths such as sitting still doing what they are told and regurgitating the things that they were told ah you mean the education system that men created in the first place that is what it used to be women have been trying to change it and add more interesting things to the curriculum unfortunately most people in charge of education at the upper levels are men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they want you to be impressed but are too self centred to realise that lecturing someone about something they already know is not impressive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that being said the term mansplaining gets overused to the point where people now dismiss it out of hand because its been misused so many times ding ding ding we have a winner
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i remember clicking past msnbc or cnn or some such thing and seeing three women discussing the topic the end of masculinity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except it has devolved to such an extent that by now it basically just means man telling woman she has no clue regardless of context
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its use isnt limited to such things also feminism is largely based on women telling men how great it certainly is to be a man based on their experience of never having been one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is that why my anger is justified when women complain to me about manspreading after all they dont know what it is like to have dangling man berries or a male hip structure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its use isnt limited to such things also feminism is largely based on women telling men how great it certainly is to be a man based on their experience of never having been one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats how i understand it too guys barging into conversations about periods and such
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually the science is still pretty out on transgender people theres some evidence for the difference between female and male brains though which provides a pretty good basis to believe in the notion of transgender being a thing that exists get your head out of your overly conservative arse its not a hat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,arguing from rationality is weakness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the double standard is out of this world we cant say men and women are different but here we have something only a man can do and he does it because he is a man and ppl entertain this like is a real thing but you say women behave a certain way and you get call a misogynist right away
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the whole point of the term mansplaining when used correctly is that the woman does know about the subject at hand and the man either automatically assumes she doesnt because she is a woman or refuses to believe it even when she has shown she does you see thats funny recently there were two articles about mansplaining within a few day in one of our national newspapers currently declining in quality both pretty shitty and the goto example from one of the articles a woman in her late who got her position due to some stupid quotas got corrected by her deputy who was years her senior and would have gotten her job had there not been any quotas complained that she was a victim of mansplaining and of course we only got her side of the story the possibility that the guy simply was more competent than her and on top of that the fact that he had ample reason to look down on her and harbor resentment eluded the tool who wrote that article this is by the way how the term mansplaining is pretty commonly used
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but if i have a phd in meteorology and the person im talking to is a sports writer and they start explaining the weather to me even though they know about my phd im going to be a bit confused about why theyre doing it and annoyed youre telling me theyre a trend in society with men uneducated in a subject trying to condescending explain said subject to a woman who has a phd in said subject yeah not buying it it has to be gendered because it refers specifically to something men do to women how do you know this have you ever experienced life as a man how else would you know how patronizing we are to each other then i hope your proof isnt your boyfriend agreeing with you i think feminist way overestimate how nice men are to each other
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he also kept talking over you and saying things that youd already said as if no one had said them yet or you werent part of the conversation i was like yeah that happens im a guy and ive head people talk over me as well thats why its good to have a term for it it has to be gendered because it refers specifically to something men do to women not being a patronising ass in general which is also a thing when i was in college i had a male classmate who corrected something a female professor said in class what a great example of manplaining right actually i lied my professor was a man sometimes knowitall students try to correct their professors maybe men are more likely to act all cocky and confident that way but they dont just mansplain to women still i think the term mansplain is meant to be deliberately offensive i dont walk around talkingdown to women but the term pisses me off since im pissed off im less likely to support women when they complain about this instead im going to roll my eyes and get annoyed by feminists using gendered slurs against men it turns me into an enemy if women want to complain about this they need to use nongendered language if they want to say that guy talked down to me thats fine by me if they want to say he mansplained then im not going to be on their side tldr if you want to make enemies keep using the term mansplain on the plus side it will validate feminists view that the world is against them while being oblivious to the fact that they went out of their way to piss people off
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its condescending hostile and intended to choke off any discussion its not surprising its usually used by feminists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mansplaining isnt a gendered slur theres a big difference between observing a behaviour you dislike eg sleeping around or assuming someone must be ignorant because theyre female and criticising the actual character of the person slut and criticising the behaviour mansplaining its not a slur on the person just a term for a particular action it is a slur i dont think youd argue that saying shes out slutting around or shes acting like a bitch isnt a gendered slur slutting around and acting like a bitch are actions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so any time a women explains something i can call it womansplaining ugh there goes another social justice warrior womansplaining the fictional wage gap i like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no its a gendered slur i dont know how anybody could argue otherwise
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,acting like it is a male thing is just one more thing to ignore when it comes to the whole modern narrative weve got going on specifically acting like it is an exclusively male thing exclusively directed at women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think someone else also said that mansplaining also refers to a man explaining something to a woman that theyve never experienced and never will for example childbirth or periods i dont use the term personally so anyone is free to correct me but gender very much comes into play then and before anyone asks yes its possible to womansplain but telling the difference between someone talking about the men they know or talking about something nongendered in a condescending way is important as i suppose it is with mansplaining too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mansplaining when a man is condescending to a woman condescending when a man is condescending to anyone but a woman when a woman is condescending now i have mansplained what mansplaining means
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have been involved in the manosphere for years and have had new trps repeatedly explain rp to me in a knowitall hectoring lecturing pedantic stylewhile knowing full well i understand rp ideas and was there during much of their formulation thats trpsplaining
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the idea of education being based around regurgitation is totally accurate though dont deny it yes the education system of the was flawed and yes it was built by men but dont act like women have been trying to make the curriculum more interesting it has nothing to do with gender as someone with recent experience of education there are a lot of girls who do very well without being particularly intelligent thats why they fall behind in maths and only maths because its the subject most based on understanding these girls cant problem solve they cant think critically theyre not terrible and its not like its a huge amount getting undeserved as im british but they certainly exist contrast this with the boys who can problem solve have a more rational view of the world and yet barely achieve the same grades
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah this is by far the biggest problem i have with it its not that it never happens its that you go on google and search mansplaining examples and all you get are essentially a man tried to start a conversation with me about something i have experience with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i learned something new today thanks what would you call it if the barista and physicist were both women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats different women are perfectly capable of explaining what its like to be a man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres multiple brain scan studies regarding transgenderism and most of them seem to contradict eachother despite what youd like to believe science hasnt proven that trannies are just women stuck in mens bodies so stop transplaining science to me and what makes you think im religious lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,alpha would rule through force
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do you know she only got her job due to quotas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you see this kind of gets down to the crux of the matter obviously ive seen men talk over men and ive seen students correct lecturers i live in the world and am aware being dismissive is not a purely man to woman thing as i said in my other comment plus id argue that students should be correcting their lecturers there is a big difference between automatically explaining all things as if you must have superior knowledge and experience because reasons and not immediately kowtowing to someone just because theyre more educated than you depends on whether student was being knowitall disruptive to the teaching to show off or trying to debate an unclear point anyway this again comes down to knowledge and how secure or insecure you are about your own informed opinions if there are a few points in which someone talks over you or is condescending to you and youre a woman you can either automatically assume its because youre a woman or because people can be condescending id be inclined to believe the latter because there is no real evidence for the former but then if i over a period of many years see again and again that this tends to happen a lot from men towards women then i again have two options accept what is appearing to me to me an overwhelmingly obvious trend or keep telling myself that this is all just a subjective opinion from a place of being butthurt because someone was mean to me the ironic thing is that if people often treat your opinion is less valid youre more likely to choose the latter peoples impressions of their own ability to understand are generally informed by how others treat them if people treat you as less knowledgabletrustworthy youre going to believe that this is because you are less knowledgabletrustworthy until you suddenly realise its not just you its all the other women present and as much as you rack your brains you cant find another explanation then you get to a point where you have to admit youre ignoring truths just because theyre uncomfortable and annoying to people in the face of overwhelming evidence and you have to make a decision if youre going to accept where youve been put or youre going to speak up this isnt ignoring the objective its rightfully pointing out that the others people dont have objectivity on their side anyway for this reason i quite like the term mansplaining to describe this id argue that it isnt a gendered slur since its a description of a pattern of behaviour by some men rather than an insult directed at all men or one man in particular it should be uncomfortable and shocking its describes something that really should shock and make you uncomfortable in a society which is on paper a meritocracy in which gender doesnt matter and thats what leads me to the you dont like it i dont give a shit point if youre talking about a situation where your word and your argument doesnt matter as much and people are telling you that your argument about that makes them feel annoyed the tendency is to roll your eyes theyre already coming from a place where they dont care for your arguments before youve even opened your mouth so their opinion on them isnt going to mean much this is why weve got a situation where feminists can be dismissive and all the male tears shit you get to a point and the end of your post was one such point where you just think well i tried to have a reasonable discussion about this but you guys werent up for it i tried to make a point but someone was talking over me it seems like there are a whole load of conditions and hoop jumping for getting you on side so ive decided not to care if youre on my side anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think youre making an interesting point about pc language mansplaining check your privilege rape apologist this language can unfortunately be used in an angry nonconstructive way to choke off any discussion i like your wording there its gotten to the point where terms like rape apologist even make me uncomfortable as a feminist which id argue is really unfortunate because that particular term speaks to a detrimental phenomenon that i need to remain personally aware of given my background having worked with lowrisk adolescent sex offenders if you like a kid its really tempting to explain away his or her bad behavior but its also essential we advocate for people whove committed sex offenses without minimizing the harmful impact of their offenses the term rape apologist serves as a painful reminder that good people can enable bad behavior and shame victims through their attitudes so i got a little offtopic there also my apologies for the femsplaining taking three paragraphs of text to basically echo what you said with an addendum about the usefulness of pc language in specific contexts if you wanted to make the word femsplaining word a thing too especially in discussions of feminist theory i could totally get behind that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,femsplaining sounds better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think femsplaining would roll off the tongue better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mansplaining is a specific thing so no it wouldnt be any time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a word used to describe men doing something sexist towards women if you dont wanna be called the thing dont do the thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if thats the case then femsplaining should be used far more for example every single article by a woman claiming she wants to have it all just like men and pretty much every feminist claim about how great men have it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,manspreading when a man is rude in public in a way that inconveniences a woman being rude literally every other similar scenario im seeing a trend its like jewscience science but done by a jew which makes it bad somehow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,heh why am i not surprised theyre very touchy teenagers with some very interesting bad erotica that said trp theory isnt actually that bad some of it is a bit extreme and too general but the community is what drives me away from it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,funny you mention this most ladies i know are bad with math yet i know some guys that are good and even didnt go to universities or colleges too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women have definitely tried to make it more interesting but men still dominate school boards how the fack can anyone claim that women teachers are feminising schools when it is men who run the school boards madness and so typical of men who try to blame women for everything even things that clearly men are doing i believe schools dont do enough to foster different types of intelligence its not acceptable for either boys or girls to fall behind you cannot say boys have a more rational view of the world they certainly do not english is also based on thinking critically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no men dominate what happens in our schools men men men it is not feminized it is meninized
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in my neighborhood all the people trying to help boys do better are women were trying to make recess longer little boys generally do need it more and control the amount of homework men say were coddling the kids even when we show the evidence that recess and less homework are good for the cognitive development of a child and things like art class mansplaining hurts little boys too because god forbid women might be right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,on the other side the usual misogynistic crap of yeahah womens strengths are sitting still and doing what theyre told is valuable to any discussion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not helpful either i dont disagree with you but come on show some respect this guy isnt a troll
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because it is a gendered problem men are condescending towards women because they assume that women dont know anything and need it to be explained like a child
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just being a knowitall ass women can be condescending and patronising as well and i think that is why people say why do we have stupid terms like mansplaining why cant we just say people are being a asshole in a gender neutral way but women say they find and as a woman i also say i find that most of the time this happens it is a man to a woman and it seems to be part of how some men tend to think that women are going to be less informed and intelligent than them on the basis that they are women and perhaps subconsciously are more dismissive of things women say i read an article once about the term and the woman who came up with the term apparently did so because she was finding a pattern of guys who when she told them what area she was in would try and educate her about it using papers shed actually written herself even when she told them that she was the one whod actually come up with what they are talking about which they didnt seem to do to male friends and colleagues thats why its mansplaining
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the science is still pretty out this is what i said also i never even said you were religious except when i was writing it which i then deleted hmmm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because it was mentioned in the article
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah it can get ridiculous i was accused of rape apology because i understood why jian ghomeshi wasnt convicted and agreed with the judges statements and decision
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i want it to sound stupid to make fun of how stupid they are
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ugh but that ruins the symmetry of the words
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and womanplaning is anytime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do you know its because theyre a woman also in real life ive seen far more blatant femsplaining like anything to do with child care
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we will have to agree to disagree i adopt a condescending tone to idiots be they male or female
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh yeh its definitely the reddit users populating trp that are the problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,at the risk of sounding like the misogynist asshole that im not to be fair its an easy habit to get into because there truly are lots of ignorant under informed and frankly dim women out there not all by any means perhaps not even a majority but i spend enough of my typical day explaining almost trivially easy stuff or explaining a bit of general knowledge that id really assumed everyone knew or similar to the women around me so it tends to become my default setting before i get accused of mansplaining to boost my ego id really prefer not to have to do this and avoid it where possible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how gendered does it have to be just a personal impression but id guess that condescending explanation goes something like this man explaining to woman woman explaining to man woman to woman or man to man each at least at an individual level id expect more change by telling someone theyve been inappropriately condescending rather than telling them theyve mansplained
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you have any idea how many womengirls have told me about what its like just to be male honestly id say the level of patronising conversation is pretty or based on other factors like how you present yourself to other people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its interesting trp has a big focus on the differences between women and men but this is not addressed directly from what i can remember maybe it should be investigated further if there is evidence for it at least its an evidence that points towards inequality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you know that transgenderism has not even been proven to exist yet you believe in it with a religious like type of blind faith yet you look down on actual religious people smh there should be a new religion for people like you called transtians
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which newspaper was this sounds like a bizarre article
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i got that term thrown in my general direction there were a lot of people on the comment thread for questioning whether illustrations and fictional stories about illegal sexual activity are actually unethical like are all the people who produce or repost that lolli shit on actually engaging in sexually abusive behavior id argue no theyre not but i could see where the term rape apologist came from in that context its a controversial issue i just wish the person who used that term had posted a little more to flesh out their perspective it sort of felt like when i get downvoted on ppd like alright fine i must have solidly earned that downvote from someone elses perspective but where the fucks the conversation about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah ive been repeatedly criticised in various communities for pointing out jian ghomeshi is not a rapist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh you i havent raped children so im not a child rapist but if you mansplain you are mansplaining you are in fact right now trying to mansplain mansplaining to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is this at work unless youre a teacher i cant imagine an environment where itd be cool for you to spend a significant amount of time helping people you arent being paid to help
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it it is proven not to exist then i will change my mind but i happen to know some trans people and i see no issue with believing them i realise its illogical but theres no reason for me to openly doubt them gender is either inherent or a social construct it seems more rational to me that it is inherent and from that a very easy path to transgender
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikidiezeit it was an online article though and as most other newspapers they a have the tendency to go for clickbait and b their online editoral staff members are prone to being whiny progressives with an sjwbent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is now i just made it a thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i havent raped children so im not a child rapist just a serial murderer then you are in fact right now trying to mansplain mansplaining to me considering i never used that term anywhere in any comment i dont see how you came to that conclusion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do feminists womansplain or are they the only ones who get to make up fake words like rape culture and mansplaining
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so much shit is labelled mansplaining though its actually unreal the level of totally normal situations that get labelled mansplaining its seriously just a term to shut down debate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,collegial assistance is encouraged in my workplace
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its rational to you that a man would willing go through castration and further disfigure himself through artificial hormones and plastic surgery turning himself into a much weaker and emasculated version of himself with no reproductive system who now has to take artificial hormones for the rest of his life to keep the semi feminine shape his body has developed from morphing back to being masculine and walks around with an open wound between his legs he has to keep penetrating so it wont close on him the notion that a boy could grow up to become a woman is silly a man is a man even if he disfigures himself beyond repair and the whole concept of gender is ridiculous man and woman are not simply labels anyone can pick and choose from and change at will a man is an adult male and a woman is an adult female sex cant be changed and gender is a farce
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it seems so odd to me that a leftist sjw would specifically note that the woman in question only got her job because of quotas and not competence what was the context they mentioned this in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,stop maninquiring
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some of them do but i think theyre just cuntfused
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like most feminist buzzwords dont say that youre triggering people dont say that thats rape apologism dont say that thats mansplaining etc sjw communication is roughly denying the other party the right to make any statement that diverges from their pov
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well sounds like you work somewhere that attracts dummies youre much less likely to notice your incompetent male colleagues because of your own bias as well as because theyre less likely to ask for help
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course it is irrational which is why when someone is willing to go through so much you have to question their sincerity personally i find the tumblr idea of gender totally ridiculous but when you look at trans people before and after they are so much happier after and it makes no sense i agree but its true
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she had a leadership position and it was mentioned how she got here clumsy translation inc knew as well that it was ultimately a question of power that her deputy would have liked to get her job but that the employer prefered a woman in that position ie despite him being years her senior she got the job due to having a vagina
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,manquiring
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theyre there too theres just fewer of them dummies i mean its an overwhelmingly male majority workforce stem field though so guys are just generally more competent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even after a full transition transgenders remain with a suicide rate much higher than the general population transgenders seem to never be truly happy even after a full transition you dont think it would be a better choice to give trannies medication which will actually work to help cure them of their gender dilusion and suicidal thoughts instead of encouaging trannies to wreck their bodies in an attempt to become the opposite sex which is impossible and theres also such a thing as transabled you know people who claim they are meant to be handicapped and will purposefully attempt to injure themselves to make it a reality do you see the transables in the same way you see transgenders they both go through great lengths to make their delusion a reality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mancorrecting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no transgender is as far as i go when i see some studies showing transgenderism is bullshit ill change my mind but until then i dont see any reason to be confrontational about it i dont meet a religious person and say youre delusional either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so a man who finds happiness in chopping off one of his limbs to live as a handicap sounds like bullshit to you but a man who removes his entire reproductive system and goes around masquerading as a woman doesnt no hypocrisy there lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is your pill blue da ba dee da ba die do you have casual sex on a semifrequent basis like a rabbit have you ever had a one night stand yeah beautiful piece of furniture i also do hook ups have you ever been to a night club yes but sometimes the club cant even handle me have you ever been drunk before my blood type is captain morgan have you ever smoked weed or a different illegal drug id get an f on a drug test what is the shortest amount of time between one you have met someone and when you first slept with them seconds do you lift weights at the gym i do push ups and sit ups every day

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i believe something hindering ppd as a sub is that bpers and rpers have very different personal perspectives and experiences with relationships and sex this makes it hard to debate as often time we are coming from different backgrounds not just different experiences but contrasting genetic incentives personality types iq levels rk selection scale liberal versus conservative beliefs etc honestly there will never be agreement here so i simply enjoy the intellectual sparring what is your pill purple pill but about red do you have casual sex on a semifrequent basis no three year dry spells are my norm have you ever had a one night stand yes hated it have you ever been to a night club no have you ever been drunk before yes but i hold my liquor very well the world was spinning but my mind remained balanced have you ever smoked weed or a different illegal drug yes going to leave it at that what is the shortest amount of time between one you have met someone and when you first slept with them three hours do you lift weights at the gym no i did in the past but didnt care for it today just basic cardio and many different calisthenics of different kinds edit presentation

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i believe something hindering ppd as a sub is that bpers and rpers have very different personal perspectives and experiences with relationships and sex this makes it hard to debate as often time we are coming from different backgrounds i thought to make this survey as a way to gauge that answer the following questions what is your pill mostly red do you have casual sex on a semifrequent basis yes have you ever had a one night stand yes have you ever been to a night club yes not big on them though have you ever been drunk before yes but not since age have you ever smoked weed or a different illegal drug no what is the shortest amount of time between one you have met someone and when you first slept with them mins do you lift weights at the gym yes

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of red pill shit is disconnected with men and women being different i kind of literally just think there is a difference and then leave it at that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my roommate is an antired mtf feminine and masculine are real but they arent the same as male and female even if they arent evenly distributed between the two and theres a lot of negativepessimistic stereotyping edit plus the redpill minimizes the amount of people who are a varying blend of masculine and feminine traits
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i did ballet as a kid so i suppose i decided that its time to inflict more damage on my body for a beautiful art form i love silks though theyre so beautiful artistic and require so much strength i find them to be incredibly fascinating grace and strength rolled into one beautiful form of exercise
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,seriously you can just order that shit on amazon here they ask you what you want it for just say youre a caterer and they give you the thumbs up same process for the otc codeine and morphine come to think of it haha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the us nitrous isnt illegal you can get it as whipped cream chargers recreational use is illegal in some states but its not scheduled at a federal level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure you can its an offlabel use thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,meh still counts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,read anything academic about selfreported survey results then get back to me on how its only red pillers who dont report their experiences with accuracy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,assholes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it isnt i havent done it in decades i must have just thought it was illegal lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rp doesnt say masculine and feminine are the same thing as male and female dont know why you think it does too many redpill lectures like masculine women who can use trp game and feminine men who can use the advice of redpill wives must only be trying to fool ourselves but succeeding on trp terms only depressed the hell out of me and buying into their theories on women got me played by every single woman who was willing to tell me that only meeting face to face for random hookups was totally a relationship that was going places so myths busted being realistic often seems negative but that doesnt make it false it does when you cherry pick the reasons to be pessimistic its just as bad as unchecked optimism nearly everyone is a blend id need to dig the posts up which is nearly impossible with reddits limited search functions but youre the exception in being reasonable about this ive been assured that the most extreme masculine and feminine outliers represent an obtainable goal for everyone and its only societal hangups that get in the way anyways im upvoting you for all the welcome common sense and genuine good faith curiosity in these two posts thank you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whether you wanted to or not you still went to a club no one cares about your reasons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not seeing how this follows from your link he literally says that our basest instincts are only a cover story for poor smv depressed because its true and you dont want it to be no depressed because sex without emotions actually hurts me in a very literal sense thats difficult to describe to other personality types i suppose it feels like the worst kind of heartbreak like rejection and in a sense a punishment its something that took me completely by surprise because i think sex itself is very beautiful and id never judge those who only seek it on its own terms by the way the redpill was also wrong when it told me that there was no way she was going to actually sleep with me theres no way i would have let her talk me into anyways i learned a lot of things that broke the models why did you think meeting for random hook up was a relationship in itself she said i love you friends with benefits are much more honest are they not goals depends who you are i think most people strive to be the best of both worlds as you describe yourself doing you and your niceness since when im playing an asshole on the internet same as nearly everyone else but theres nothing gained by always being negative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are more agressive i will give you that women are far more manipulative and hateful than men given their smaller stature manipulation is a womans primary tool in terms of hateful i would have to dig into my archives but women hold a grudge more than men men do some crazy shit if you try to kill me as a man i might forgive you and get on with things you wont get such a pass from a woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes women are more acceptingbut also more back stabbing and hold grudges forever if i am sick i know a female friend will come and take care of meso they are more nurturingbut if i have an argument with a woman even if i apologise in most cases she wont forgive and forget
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i havent found that to be the case on average but in general it seems like the most extreme of any quality are men including the worst people in history
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my own life experience has been that both men and women are manipulative as hell both of them are self serving and hypocritical i disagree that the good men are held back by toxic masculinity for one thing i dont know what toxic masculinity even is now i am a woman so a majority of my friends are women that does not mean i think women are betteri think my friends are that is why they are my friends ironically one of the reasons i often disagree with trp is when they paint men as more loyal more likely to offer unconditional love more steadfast ect ect because that has not been my experience either people arent nice they have their own shit going on and they are generally benignly self absorbed or unreliable but i dont see it breaking down by sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really in my experience women are just as manipulative as men heck i can say that in general people are manipulative they want to be nice to you in order to gain something whether its favor money connection etc i have been hurt by both genders my close friend is a backstabber she dumped me when i make the slightest mistake never mind the fact that i forgave her for the fact that she once backstabbed me later on she looked for me without apologizing because apparently she needed me to teach her math because exam was approaching go figure then there was one time i had a crush with a guy but i was too obvious and everybody knew and they made fun of me including the said guy apparently they found it cute that a socially retarded girl had a crush on the cool guy since then i just fangirl actors less of a hassle that way i also fear getting intimate with other people and rather keep a distance with them regarding trpers of course they will say the opposite they have been hurt by women in the past after all so its understandable i read some of their stories and yeah those women are so terrible to the point you just want them to die if you really want to see the worst of women you should go read those posts by trpers who were hurt by women i think the fact that they go to trp really says something about the women that they had relationship with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol us men dont really have the desire to manipulate as much as even the most average women you just sound like a bp white knight with this post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,meh i think ive known more cruel women than men but id guess theres an equal amount of crappy people on both sides i dont think toxic masculinity automatically makes someone a bad person so im excluding that part but ime being an asshole aggressive manipulative hateful not gendered things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gotta provide evidence besides your personal experience this is a debate subreddit you need more here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a learned trait though men have to be these things and when youve lost the hard way youll understand what i mean id rather be an aggressive angry determined alpha for my own sanity and survival than some passive aggressive bitch with a developed complex most women get to coast through life picking and choosing where to go men have to prove themselves a lot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think both genders express their displeasure and hatred for others in different ways i find it harder to tolerate male expressions because it can be violent and in some cases fatal but women have a bad habit of not expressing their anger soon enough which often leads that seething grudgeholding passive aggression that comes from a buildup of too much unexpressed emotion i also think men tend to be more uncaring whereas women tend to be more spiteful with that said im surprised there are so many people here who seem to think men dont hold grudges or dont do underhanded womanlike crap to get back at people in my experience hell hath no fury like a mans bruised ego ive seen fathers and husbands withhold financial support from their own kids just to get back at the woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i find that women in general make better friends are more honest and more accepting than men they are more communicative in their relationships dont mind being vulnerable and form closer emotional connections your last part is true but your first part holy shit no women will very rarely help you with constructive criticism and honesty for example but theyre sure supportive and emotional i dont need friends that just make me feel good men make much better friends overall their advice is more serious and trustworthy theyre more interesting and have more knowledge they take things less personally the worst manipulators ive met in my life were men men that train to be machiavellian or naturally became so are capable of far more evil than most women so sure and many of the good men i have in my life seem held back by toxic masculinity extreme and stupid forms of masculinity are bad wow what a surprise i dont pin this down to biological essentialism but rather socialization with instills harmful attitudes its just bad development anyway my experiences seem to directly contradict those of many rpers this is interesting because it seems they fail to connect with the good women that they meet you sound like you hate men really typical misandry
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the worst manipulators ive met in my life were men and many of the good men i have in my life seem held back by toxic masculinity i literally laughed out loud when i read this thank you for making me feel smart your sexist statement about men is really no better than kkk members calling black people derogatory names
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never read anything that directly contradicts my life experiences and impressions of society more than your post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think women and men both have flaws that are based both in biological difference and the culture they were raised in men tend to be more physically destructive and generally less respectful of women than women are of men i think in general women empathize more with men than men do with women however women are not so great to each other and ive had to deal with many instances in my life where girls were absolutely cruel to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no on the hateful yes if you mean openly hostile instead racism is pretty much entirely a female domain at this point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i see hateful more as wishing people harm than holding a grudge if someone tries to kill me its basic self preservation not to trust them theres no hate there just practicality if i wish people individuals or groups harm because of it or for some abstract reason that is what i would call hateful women are certainly capable of bigotry and malice but i see these attitudes much more often with men i agree with you that women tend to be more manipulative though for the reasons you stated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep i absolutely agree women in general hold grudge more than man men in general tend not to sweat it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hmmm does that also mean the best people in history are men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men dont know what toxic masculinity is it doesnt help that its original explanation has been mostly lost and toxic masculinity can be anything a random woman finds to gripe about at that moment regarding men if we hold the door for a woman she might complain about toxic masculine concepts like chivalry if we dont hold the door another will say its mens selfish and egotistical nature and therefore toxic masculinity most of the women in my life just tell the guys to ignore the concept
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im gay and have no sexual interest in women so not exactly a white knight
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats perfectly fair i find that the range of human expression between gender to be two closely interlapping bell curves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a false dichotomy youre representing you dont have have to adopt negative traits to garner some persona and you dont have to drop positive traits you can be sane determined sensitive and strong all at once
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some cases fatal in so few that media can televise every single one thats not a black guy in chicago
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont hate men and the fact that you jump to that conclusion so quickly is odd on the whole i like women better than men but there are many men i like
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,did you just compare me saying that some men are held back by attitudes instilled in them by socialization to the kkk let me make a comparison that actually works much like how many people in the black community are held back from reaching their full potential through poverty or racism many men fail to reach their full potential due to being taught harmful societal attitudes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fair enough we both have different life experiences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,male hatred for groups is more common women tend to have more hatred towards specific people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people dont tend to agree who the best people are but most philosophers and inventors in history were men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre still a white knight just with different intent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,under or over i often enjoy seeing gay opinions before and after they hit their epiphany and start rasising families their gay friends are thrown out like lunch and they become surprisingly homophobic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are no negative masculine traits again youre a self hating misandrist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this should be easy terms like mansplain and toxic masculinity are inherently sexist terms you clearing being a feminist dont quite understand that because the religion has convinced you to think a certain way both terms paint a specific gender men in a negative light when you call masculinity toxic youre shaming men for being men since masculinity is a male trait youre essentially shaming someone for being born with a penis you might as well shame a black person for being born black let me flip the script so maybe you can understand i mean how would you feel if you were giving parenting advice to a man and he decided to say you were womanxplaning then proceeded to write off all of your advice by calling you out on your womanxplaning pretty sexist right its no different than saying mansplain or that your toxic femininity holds you back because you use your sexuality to get what you want manipulative behavior instead of getting what you want through hard work and dedication and thus growing to be a better person incredibly sexist if you ask me but maybe flipping the gender might help you understand how truly sexist people who use those terms are now i will explain to you why you dont think toxic masculinity or mansplain are sexist terms do you have white grandparents or older you know the ones that always talk about black people in a negative light that is because they grew up in a society where it was ok to put black people down until the civil rights movement and even then it was still somewhat acceptable to demean black people the feminist movement does the similar thing all the like minded feminists get together and start making up all these demeaning words that shame men when they are used enough they convince themselves that using gender based shaming is ok thus feminists start using words like mainsplain and toxic masculinity and dont actually think about how they are sexist terms or just dont care also if you really do think that men are more manipulative than women then im wasting my time maybe you arent good at picking up on subtle manipulation but women use it all the damn time i work in an office full of women and i have lost count on the amount of manipulative things that happen from day to day manipulating male bosses to get easy tasks manipulating others to get them to do their work being nice to peoples face then talking shit about them behind their back and list goes on im a man and typically we dont have as much social intelligence as women do but i pick up on manipulation tactics women use all the time my secret is i dont think with my dick i think with my brain makes it a little more difficult to be manipulated edit you seem to be one of those feminist snowflakes that believe all women are wonderful incapable for doing wrong and all men are violent aggressive rapists for your own sake i suggest you unplug from the feminist movement and start with some self reflection because being sexist isnt an attractive trait
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hate even for specific people is more a male emotion imo its the opposite of love and fueled by anger women are more apt to just stop caring about someone and men respond to this with anger and then hate men are bad at disconnecting from an emotional bond once its been established
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or maybe im just someone with different experiences and opinions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this just reads as delusional
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are there negative feminine traits then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont seem to have much understanding of what toxic masculinity or mansplaining mean as words regardless i didnt use the word mansplain toxic masculinity just refers to learned behaviors associated with cultural ideas of masculinity that are harmful to oneself and others not all masculinity is toxic and toxic masculinity is not inherit to being a man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so i guess hell hath no fury like a woman scorned only gained popularity due to everyones misogyny not because there was a kernel of truth to that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women are more apt to just stop caring about someone i have not seen this anecdotally if men have a competitive outlet they easily diffuse their feelings towards each other imo women hold their hate much easier than men i also think that sometimes male hateon a personal level isnt actually hate its just business or jealousy ever notice when women fight they commonly do things like take off their heels and try to actually maim each other or try to rip out each others hair its not about dominance they want to ruin each others lives imo men can diffuse their feelings through respect but i havent witnessed women do that to each other
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its always good to be reminded that bloops are just as sexist as your average terp they just hide it a tiny bit better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you make better friends with the gender group youre not attracted to but hate on the one that you are attracted to yes ive seen that before
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,get older gay friends or are you scared of the bears
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope all feminine traits serve women andor her family
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not all masculinity is toxic and toxic masculinity is not inherit to being a man i love how you ignored everything in my post then double downed on your sexist statements thats not called a debate that is called plugging your ears with your fingers and saying la la la i cant hear you out loud you know one of the things i dont like about trp is the generalizations about women one of those generalizations is about women being children but unfortunately in this instance youre furthering trp theory seems there is no debate to be had here so i think im done thanks for the laughs though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh of course im not denying that women are capable of anger and hate just that men feel and express these emotions on average more often and more intensely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont hate men i just think that on the whole their held back by their socialization i have good male friends
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so then logically a man can have any mixture of feminine and masculine traits and be none the lesser for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this post is amazingly childish i ignored most of your post because it didnt seem to have much to do with the topic on hand neither did it seem to have much to do with what we were discussing rather than explaining how what i said is sexist you made a bizarre comparison between what i said and the rhetoric of a hate group then i made a by comparison of the concept i was explaining to another widely accepted concept like youre free to just declare victory and leave but this still doesnt look good for you or your argument
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont confuse aggressive outburst with hatred men are typically more aggressive sure but we dont generalizing tend to harbor the seething anger for long periods of time that women do to see this just look at the lengths women will go to in order to ruin the lives of the people they hate long unnecessarily protracted divorce battles conducted out of spite in an effort to destroy the man often with little to no real upside to the woman am a lawyer not a divorce lawyer and the running joke is that the only winners in a divorce litigation like this are the lawyers look at false rape allegations women who dont care about the lives they are ruining with no real upside for themselves all to pursue a vendetta or forget men look at how women behave to other women they despise sabotaging their relationships bullying efforts slut shaming true or not women especially young women tend to be downright vicious to one another despite the feminist dream of the contrary
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,personally from past friendships with gay men they definitely tend to fizzle out in similar ways to the female friendships in a strange way they often have a female perspective on things its hard to explain this but the way they often communicate is generally not something i identify with its like the conversation never grabs my attention enough to take off im certainly a lot less likely to open up my uninhibited self to a gay guy its like talking to a really ugly girl im not interested in her on average i wont identify much with her on a personality level on top of that theres always some weird onesided sexual tension
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what do you mean by none the lesser it depends on goals traits can all be developed or not more development is usually good
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this post is amazingly childish childish no abrasive yes but can you blame me i dont like sexist people i realize portions of my posts were me being a dick but sometimes people need to be told directly that the words they use are unacceptable even if they think they perfectly acceptable much like old white people using the n word i ignored most of your post because let me finish this thought for you i ignored most of your post because you made me realize that i use language that discriminates against a certain gender that can be perceived as me being sexist considering i do not believe that im sexist i am therefore not sexist no matter your argument i will create my own reality because your arguments conflict with my world view rather than explaining how what i said is sexist you made a bizarre comparison between what i said and the rhetoric of a hate group i realize now this is a of waste of time considering i had different paragraphs in my previous post explaining why those words are sexist i guess you must have either not read it or covered your eyes with your hands some people are beyond saving i try to help people come to the realization of their bigotry but not everyone wants to be greeted with reality like youre free to just declare victory and leave but this still doesnt look good for you or your argument i didnt declare victory in fact i failed getting through to you because your mind is completely made up and closed off i dont understand why people with your mindset come to debate reddits at all debating is about challenging people getting people to think and see other perspectives and possibly changing viewpoints when others present valid logical statistical and factual arguments instead what happened is you made sexist remarks i pointed out why they are sexist then you claim i didnt even explain why the words you used were sexist and ignored of the points i made in my large post feels reels i guess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre projecting male emotional patterns on women and proving my point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if theres always onesided sexual tension then i guarantee you that tension doesnt actually exist not every gay man you talk to is going to want to fuck you and id say that gay men often have a different perspective socially than straight men this doesnt make them better or worse however i am going to go out on a limb here if you find yourself consistently unable to empathize with an entire class of people then the problem isnt due to said class much like the if you meet constantly meet assholes everyday you are the asshole saying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men pretend unattractive women or women they dont like period dont exist women will at least still try to connect with unattractive men on some level and be cordial thats where the differences begin
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i mean to ask if an effeminate man is no better or worse than a masculine one in your view
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,edit just chill out dude theres no need to devolve into rambling and personal attacks on internet forums
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no youre being delusional gee cant seem to recall any false rape trials by men against women or any men that wanted to protract a divorce proceeding to ensure the woman ends up broke and desperate oh yeah maybe all the slut shaming men do to each other right the only thing youve proven is an inability to debate in good faith
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if theres always onesided sexual tension then i guarantee you that tension doesnt actually exist not every gay man you talk to is going to want to fuck you although a lot of gays have come onto me over the years way to completely miss the point the point is not that theyre interested in dating me the point is that when one persons sexual orientation is towards what you are and the others is not the relationship has an uneven dynamic its often awkward and an obstacle to friendship and yes often leads to them wanting something in my case if you find yourself consistently unable to empathize with an entire class of people then the problem isnt due to said class dude what seriously i have no idea how you related this to my empathy for gay men my post was that friendship with gays have held complications that dont exist in heterosexual male friendship making it more difficult im generally much less invested in the friendship as i get less out of it i still have plenty of gay friends those friendships are just generally more similar to female friendships than male ones as a straight male female friendships on average require a lot more maintenance than male friendships i already have way too many friends and dont have time to maintain anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well yeah they identify more with women sexuality affects everyone massively its funny when you dont even see your own feminist brainwashing making you hate yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh its one sided not my side fucking christopher of course he knows what a chelsea boot was
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i value growth and strength and despise weakness and stupidity masculine traits drive growth and strength largely theyre great for competition and achieving however feminine developed a man is he should be even more masculine developed and the higher his masculine development the higher his feminine development is allowed to be the main places effeminate men have advantages is in replacing womens roles for everything else theyre gonna be at a disadvantage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or any men that wanted to protract a divorce proceeding to ensure the woman ends up broke and desperate youve never seen this before youre lucky then and that explains your viewpoint
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no you have tunnel vision and projecting your male perception on women that this is rooted in hatred and rage is your male interpretation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im just guessing that your friendships wouldnt have these complications if you did understand women better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you do feel that feminine traits are intrinsically inferior to masculine traits as feminine traits hold men back in your mind you seem to be implying that feminine traits carry with them weakness andor stupidity the truth that ive found in my life is that both traditionally feminine and traditionally masculine traits have their good sides and bad sides both sexes need a combination of both and feminine traits are useful outside of traditionally female roles and masculine traits are useful outside of traditionally male roles having this strict traditionalist view of gender roles helps nobody
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive only seen cases where both of them declare war on each other both go on the offensive that shit cray
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women have more opportunities to cheat than men women avoid conflict more than men i posit that women cheat more than men a lot more it seems blatantly obvious that women have more opportunities to cheat than men do women are a lot more likely than men are to be approached and pursued and given the opportunity for sex to the point that many women actively find it annoying and a burden in one way or another whether because they dont find the men appealing because it interrupts them going about their lives because they see mens sexual desire as offensive or demeaning because theyve experienced bad reactions when rejecting or anything like that but having more opportunities doesnt necessarily mean that they cheat more especially in light of research on mens and womens sex drives these bolded factors below could plausibly make women less interested in taking the casual sex options that theyre given across many different studies and measures men have been shown to have more frequent and more intense sexual desires than women as reflected in spontaneous thoughts about sex frequency and variety of sexual fantasies desired frequency of intercourse desired number of partners masturbation liking for various sexual practices willingness to forego sex initiating versus refusing sex making sacrifices for sex and other measures no contrary findings indicating stronger sexual motivation among women were found hence we conclude that the male sex drive is stronger than the female sex drive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i disagree with this women are also more prone to avoid conflict if a woman is not happy in the relationship she is more likely to cheat than to confront her unhappiness head on and break up i dont think this is always true i think some women will cheat then divorce divorce is too easy to get alimony and child support are too easy to get the free money gravy train coupled with freedom to hop back on the cougar carousel is too tantalizing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,other posters have already addressed why assuming that just because women have more opportunities to cheat doesnt mean they actually cheat more women have lower sex drives and more importantly the empirical evidence we have relating to this question points to the conclusion that men cheat more the few studies im aware of by googling this topic about minutes ago all claim that men usually cheat more than women while i agree that women are on average much more likely to avoid conflict i disagree that this means she would use cheating as an indirect solution to her unhappiness one could just as easily argue that because women are more prone to avoid conflict they would avoid cheating more because of the inevitable and large conflict infidelity usually leads to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the title of your cmv is true women do have more opportunities to cheat women do avoid more conflict than men but the conclusion in the body of your post that women actually do cheat more than men isnt true for one of the reasons stated in your title women hate conflict theyre riskadverse if their relationship is okay theyre less likely to fuck it up for an unknown just because they can being riskadverse theyre also not very likely to go home with strangers or have spontaneous sex with men they barely know it happens but most women find those types of situations unsettling theyre risky i do agree however that if a woman is unhappy in a relationship she is going to make sure she has her next branch secure before she ends it unless things are extremely untenable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont really put up much of an argument men admit to cheating more than women and im inclined to take that to mean they cheat more it seems like nothing but rage porn to assume the opposite at best you can argue that the studies arent accurate but without any reason to believe the opposite
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so my recently divorced friend is on tinder and just got this extremely charming message from a guy youre so hot i want to give your dad a blow job so i can taste where you came from edit i couldnt remember the exact verbiage so i asked her it was taste the recipe which we googled and apparently is a popular dirty pickup line which i find absolutely baffling anyway aside from the obvious grossness what made it extra awkward is that my friends dad died over ten years ago so she replied with sorry my dads dead and has yet to hear back from the guy lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fun happenings in the life of mr dcd my girlfriends roommate has taken a dislike to me and has begun an active campaign against me apparently im a fuckboy i hate dealing with this sort of shit nothing but drama
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was going to make an op about this but its really just a random thought thats probably better suited for the offtopic thread does anyone dance anymore i dont mean club dancing but actual ballroomdancehall type dancing where theres a leader and a follower the kind of dancing where the boy is in front of the girl as my boyfriend cutely put it one time the other day a coworker asked me what i like to do on the weekends and one of the things i mentioned was going dancing and she didnt understand what i meant by that which blew me away but i got to thinking that maybe this isnt something people really do outside of texasoklahoma my coworker is a recent transplant from the northeast here country and tejano music are always en vogue at least among a large segment of the population and people go out on the weekends to country or tejano bars and theres usually a live band sometimes a dj and you dance even my friends who hate country music enjoy the occasional night of twostepping its just part of the culture here but in areas where those types of music arent popular i imagine dancing is a pretty niche thing that not many people do no one listens to jazz or swing or blues anymore and edm or hip hop dancing or moshing at a rock show do people still mosh idk isnt really the same thing am i right and if i am do you think this has any effect of the smp and the way men and women interact i realize that may be a bit of a stretch last night i was cleaning up the kitchen and my boyfriend was getting ready to go hang out with his friends i had country music on as he was headed out the door he pulled me out into the living room danced with me through the end of the song then left i thought about it for the rest of the night and shit went down when he got home the thing is i feel like a lot of guys these days would think that dancing is gay or unmasculine but for me there is no quicker way to get me in the headspace of you are a man i am a woman and as such i will trust and submit to you than dancing they say dancing is the vertical expression of horizontal desire it literally requires the man to take initiative and lead and the woman to let go and follow and ive often seen dancing metaphors used in trp writing but i dont get the impression that these are guys who actually know their way around a dance floor thats not a dig at rp guys really like i said i get the impression that its not something many people do anymore anyway just some very disjointed thoughts i was thinking this morning

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,looks arent important compared to attraction which is different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,looks are a part of the attraction depending on the person the importance of it varies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes attraction can involve looks but is so much more than just looks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its because male sexuality is almost always portrayed as constantly in the on position and easy to satisfy whereas female sexuality is portrayed as being something typically off unless a complicated series of actions is performed seduction or it is forcefully taken from her rape this is untrue in both cases also the thing that people especially men dont understand is that a fantasy of banging a hot teacher is very different than being forced into sex when you dont want it life is different than imagination and some boys and girls do not want to have sex with an authority figure no matter how attractive they are i had a year old friend in high school who was raped by one of his female teachers after class he ended up not telling the cops or his parents about it because he didnt want to go through all the court proceedings and questions but he told me about it in confidence he was crying as he told me how humiliated he felt because of his automatic erection how scared he was of hurting her by fighting back at all and how angry he was that his first time was ripped away from his control he had some minor gynophobia after that and like me began to experience a fear of skinonskin contact he didnt date at all through high school and struggled greatly with his sexuality as he felt betrayed by his body for reacting as it did i absolutely hated that cunt for using my friend as she did putting him through that mental turmoil just so she could get herself off whether it was for sex or just validation doesnt mattershe was a rapist and of a minor to boot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,myself and my female friends were all appalled at mary kay letourneau thirteen year olds are only a step up from babies my nephew was at the time we had the same experience as you it was all men who thought it was cool and a yo was a man id say a large part of the sentencing discrepancy is the large number of males judges personally id throw the book at them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think the less angry and disgusted response towards female teachermale student relations is more related to toxic masculinity sex is always good and a sign of success for menmen cant get raped than it is benevolent sexism as for my own feelings on the one hand i dont think we should immediately jump towards characterizing sex between teachers and students as rape in the full sense of the word it shouldnt be illegal of course but the victim should get the priority in characterizing what happened to him or her this goes regardless of the gender of the victim on the other hand ive got a younger brother who just turned and is in his final year of high school if a teacher even one in her midtwenties slept with my younger brother id be pretty outraged and disgusted that shit just does not seem right to me at all and thats with him being of age i cannot imagine an adult with authority sleeping with what are functionally children aged and that not being thoroughly fucked up i think the reason youd be automatically appalled by a male teacher sleeping with a female student is because youve got paternalistic feelings towards young women and have a hard time granting them agency and their own sexuality at the same time the reason you have such a hard time thinking you or any other male could feel like a victim when taken advantage of by a female teacher is because your memories of your own childhood are clouded by your ideas about masculinity i think the best response in cases like this regardless of the gender of either the teacher or the student is to always assume some form of advantage was taken but to take care not to force trauma onto the victim that might not be there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is one of those topics that gets my blood pressure up but here i go anyway heres the thing you dont even have to look at this from the perspective of whether the kid feels like a victim or not a lot of female students who have affairs with teachers dont feel like victims either hell a girl my brother went to school with was fucking their english teacher all through high school and now shes married to him and by all accounts they seem to be happy im sure she didntdoesnt feel like a victim its still wrong for a teacher to fuck a student i dont care if they have written consent from the kid and their parents its still a huge violation of professional ethics and it undermines the legitimacy of the entire profession every time one of these dumbasses does it as a teacher you have a responsibility not only to that student but to his or her parents to his or her peers to the entire school community and to your fellow teachers when you shit where you eat even if everythings consensual and blah blah blah you are whittling away at the structure of the way a school is supposed to operate even if the kid is okay with it and even on the off chance the kids parents are okay with it how are other students going to feel other parents other teachers dont tell me it doesnt matter its between the two of them because thats not how teaching works you have a responsibility to do right by the entire community you serve parents have a right to send their kids to school without worrying about whether their teachers are more concerned with fucking them than teaching them the other teachers in your school have a right to the respect of their students and i dont care how mature you all think high schoolers supposedly are when they find out a teacher fucked a student that affects how they view every authority figure in that school its hard enough these days for teachers to maintain the respect of their students theres no reason to make it more difficult for yourself and every other teacher in your school if you find yourself attracted to teenagers to the point where you would seriously consider fucking one dont be a teacher do one of the millions of other jobs thats available to you if you find that you are really in twuuuu wuuuuv with one of your students then it shouldnt be a big deal to wait a couple years until theyre no longer your student and then start fucking them if you cant do that walk down to your principals office and tender your resignation then fuck that kid to your hearts content provided theyre over the age of consent in your area thats a separate issue there is no excuse at all ever for a teacher to have sex with a student period and heres where i get judgmental so sorry in advance when i was teaching high school my students were kids to me even the most mature worldly ones had moments of immaturity and childishness i think any grown adult who can work with teenagers all day and seriously think about fucking one has a mental illness no im not saying theyre pedophiles so please dont accuse me of such if you can work in a high school and see those kids as anything other than the babies they are theres something wrong with you i teach adults now some of my students are older than i am i would still never dream of sleeping with one of my students because it would be so so inappropriate and such a huge violation of my ethics and my responsibilities toward the community i serve as far as im concerned any teacher who does this no matter how consensual the relationship no matter the gender deserves to have their license permanently revoked and their life ruined they deserve every ounce of punishment they get and then some
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it could be because female sexuality is way more highly valued and protected than male a teenage males sexuality is not worth much so people care little when it is taken advantage of a teenage females is worth a heck of a lot so people get angry when they deem it to have been taken advantage of funny part is that it seems to be the straight men like me who see it as less of an issue because in my mind if i were and banging my hot female mentor id be elated and would not feel like a victim in any way shape or form you say that but you dont know exactly what it would be like there could be manipulation involved and it isnt really making a good model for authority in the future i remember one uk case in which the teacher was plying her students with drink and drugs and sleeping with them if you were the parent here youd be enraged about this and doubly so that they can get away with a slap on the wrist theyre being let down by people who are supposed to be looking out for their wellbeing how will that play in the future furthermore the girls are always made out to be victims when in reality maturity is a bit more fluid than age limits how often are we told that girls mature faster than boys and yet we have situations like this another good question is why males in prison are the most at risk group for rape in society and yet there has been little to no outcry over it males arent worth much it seems
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can think that you at would feel that way but youre dong that with an adults mind and point of view you cant put yourself back into a year old mind to figure out if you really would have been harmed by this or not the issue with children and adults when it comes to sexual relationships is that children generally dont have the context to make decisions as well as someone who is older this can vary from child to child but the point of age of consent is to play averages in where a good cut off point is to limit the chance that a young person will be taken advantage of by someone with more knowledge more wisdom and more resources you can always try and make the argument that x or y kid is more mature but ultimately that shouldnt factor in my opinion because thats a broad assumption and you can never tell how it can effect a young mind its not a game id prefer to play with someones future regrets are something id rather not see someone carry from such a young age i dont know what the feminist line is on this but id assume most are against preferential treatment but that does nothing to effect my view that those who violate age of consent should be dealt with accordingly the law is the law consideration for mitigating factors can be brought into it but generally gender isnt something i consider that when it comes to being more lenient when appropriate for lesser crimes and such
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not the student its the fact that the perp is a man people seem to think men and their penises are defilers and ruiners ask how many men would be elated if they learned their fourteen year old son was being being fucked by his gym teacher im sure theyre not thinking yay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think id like to see a proper statistical analysis peer reviewed and everything before id go drawing conclusions about whether women get significantly shorter sentences than men for this we see crime through the filters that the media elects to apply to it and the media elects to apply those filters in large part to make profit off entertaining people not to further the truth that said a girl is more likely to catch diseases if her male sexual partner has them than a boy is likely to catch diseases if his female sexual partner has them so there is that and the chances of the average creepy year old male teacher physically overpowering the average year old female student is greater than if their genders were reversed so theres an extra possible facet of potential intimidation and control to the course of their relationship but the girl can have an abortion if she gets pregnant and the boy is stuck with being a father if the teacher gets pregnant and doesnt want to abort so whatever they are both awful situations resulting from adult depravity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people are biased to think that men are necessarily raping and manipulating people into sex thats why the mechanical way sex works doesnt help some psychologist describe the penetrated individual as masochist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i used to be one of those guys that thought i wish i had that opportunity at then someone mentioned stds how would you feel if some chick who had herpes couldnt get with anyone her age because they all knew so went after you and got you infected at totally changed my outlook on the issue i dont think a year old guy will be traumatized by the sexual experience but hes still vulnerable to be put at risk of ruining his life by older people that would exploit that i have a huge problem with that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,older male teachers prey on weakness they target and seduce insecure young girls and play on their emotional vulnerabilities these male teachers arent fucking the popular cheerleader with rich parents or the class president they are preying on the poor girl or the girl with no friends they target and go after weakness female teachers allow themselves to be seduced by power they are not adding the captain of the chess club or the av club on facebook and sending him racy pics they are adding the captain of the football team or the popular party guy who already has a bevy of female admirers this is the power that these male students have that makes these female teachers attracted to them if you actually read some of the conversations that the female teachers have with the male students they often take on a younger tone going into baby talk and playing a submissive role to the male student the male teachers talk in a mature and manipulative way exploiting the weaknesses of their target female students and pressuring them into engaging in sexual acts with them thats why in my opinion a female teacher is not as evil as a male teacher who sleeps with a student im sure there are cases of female teachers preying on weakness and male teachers being seduced by popular and secure girls but thats generally not the case
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is fuuuucked uppppp are my thoughts and yes it does seem to be mostly straight men who see it as a nonissue and i feel like its because they have no imagination and can only understand the situation as a fantasy i have friends who were taken advantage of by older women in positions of power in their teens it fucked them up they were victims
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im okay with it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont care what sex they are its gross and reprehensible no matter what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,benevolent sexism is just a euphemism for favorable bias or to borrow feminist language female privilege never let them tell you its some sort of oppression its oppression in the same way royals have to live in castles and have obligations of some sort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,similar treatment while men are more likely to take advantage of an authority position in order to get sex from subordinates or wards and women are more likely to experience trauma from being on the receiving end of such a treatment there is one thing that makes me look less fondly at the woman even if her fuckery was consensual her mental state a man who wants to have sex with minors and acts on that desire is a sexual predator a woman who wants to have sex with a minor on the other hand is a nutjob and neither of these two should be a teacher
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is a massive violation of trust and conflict of interest regardless of the genders involved however i would like to confess that i dont see female teachers having affairs with male students to be more problematic than the moral issues above imply the reverse doesnt register the same way just as you said it is probably social conditioning
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think sex crimes of all kinds are inexcusable and our societys refusal to acknowledge this results in male rape victims being discredited the thing is i care about those victims does rp because they only bring it up to discredit feminism if rp cares they should do something about it instead of just using it as another weapon because speaking as someone who advocates for these men this behavior only serves to further isolate them you either care about them and so should actually advocate for male victims of rape or you dont and should stop using them as weapons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whether it was for sex or just validation doesnt mattershe was a rapist and of a minor to boot your post is something i wish more people would consider if we separate the position of power she is in and look at it another way it is not impossible to consider that young boys find a sexually mature woman attractive at or they are looking at older women on tv on their phones and in real life these older women can range from to so of course they desire sex with them they are sexually mature in this way you can understand why a teen would want to sleep with his teacher shes sexually appealing to his maturing brain and body however the power dynamic is important here she has to be responsible enough to make the right decision there is this myth that women would never fuck younger guys and yet female teachers are caught sleeping with their students clearly it has an effect on them being around those boys we are paranoid about having men around teen girls in case something happens but we need to treat women the same that is equality furthermore they are rapists and they need to spend as much time in jail it doesnt matter that he wanted it because we never hear about how much the female students wanted it instead it is assumed that the male teacher was a predator when the student may have wanted to have sex with her teacher therefore we need to apply the law equally here fire her send her to jail for the same time men serve make her register as a sex offender and petition the media to stop treating it as if it was an affair be fair and call them predators and monsters too otherwise we will be encouraging an actual rape culture one where women are free to do as they please sexually at the cost of men and boys and with societys blessing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if a female student wants to fuck the male teacher and gets a crush on him shell be elated at actually getting to fuck him years down the line shell feel like a victim after the crush wears off and shes not horny anymore that regret is not the case with male students a lot of the time for a few reasons romantic attraction and horniness dont wear off as easily victims narrative is reinforced frequently by society but not men victims natural propensity to change their mind and play victim easily despite societal norms is absent from most men are a lot less desperate than men so paradox of choice makes them view any given sexual interaction in a more negative light in retrospect people act like male teacher x female student is using force or blackmail of the time these relationships with either gender student happen the student is horny at the teachers authority power or fertility doesnt make it right for the teacher to consent to the students advances but i think people should be able to honestly examine peoples reasons for doing things without making the discussion taboo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is he gay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is pretty damn young its grey for me though id congratulate my son and feel a sense of pride for him is it a double standard sure but i think the worst year old boys will need after this experience is some facial reconstruction to wipe off the ear to ear shit eating grin my best friend got to do this in hs and i was always envious even to this day to be honest
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hate to say it but this really seems to be the case and a major reason you cant just blame women for these problems the way some people do men have giant congenital biases that favor women enable the fuck out of this behavior
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i found it interesting that she got the same sentence months for rape as that douchebag brock turner did for sexual assault not rape but the mediapublic reaction was completely different definitely a double standard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think we should immediately jump towards characterizing sex between teachers and students as rape in the full sense of the word thats why statutory rape exists as a concept ianal and not an american on top of that but whenever i read this word it generally simply describe sex between an adult and a minor and consent didnt factor into it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,another good question is why males in prison are the most at risk group for rape in society and yet there has been little to no outcry over it although it helps both male and female victims justdetentionorg is a program that combats prison and jailhouse rape i agree that its not spoken of enough though and that much more needs to be done to prevent sexual crimes in these cases
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it would be just like my brazzers porno
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ask how many men would be elated if they learned their fourteen year old son was being being fucked by his gym teacher male or female gym teacher
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah this is a really good point pretty much invalidates the student wants it argument
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,male gym teacher or female
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if my son did it and had a kid id just tell him to live with his mistakes and manup hopefully my raising him would make him already see it this way its just not a terrible thing to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this supports my view that only women get fucked
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres an interesting feminist article about that which is about how due to gender stereotypes women are either seen as innocent victims or brutal vamps if they are feminine and nurturing they are more likely than men to get no sentence at all because being a criminal doesnt fit their gender role but if they arent lesbians junkies etc then they get sentenced harsher than an average guy because they are assumed to be going against their nature and have to put in effort to be a bad person its culturally assumed that men have to hold back from being violent so a criminal man simply couldnt control himself but women need to go against their nurturing nature in order to be criminals so they are assumed to be manipulative and cunning psychopaths but in the last few years decades those trends have normalized a bit due to less strict gender roles and more normal women being shown as criminals in the media and yes thats a feminist article asking for more equal sentencing of women even though it means that less get away scots free
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think things change when you factor in stds sure but lets assume all things equal and no stds for either party
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sounds hot af tbqh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,see maybe if i knew someone like that but i dont just people who are the opposite if you search it in google its mostly guys saying it was the most pleasant experience in their lives thats pretty extra
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have friends who were taken advantage of by older women in positions of power in their teens it fucked them up they were victims yeah i do too actually one by a teacher and one by his boss both say it fucked them up a little the latter guy has had a really hard time with sexrelationships as an adult and while im sure that incident isnt the only reason it contributed largely to it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but if a guy isnt negatively effected some even report positive effects from getting laid by a teacher confidence boosts and such
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the reason is because men are seen as taking the proactive role in sex and women taking the submissivepassive role so if a year old shags his teacher hes like the son of a roman emperor whos just killed a bunch of gauls before he even came of age regardless of how willing he actually was in reality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah both are predators and are fucked in the head
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think its biological conditioning
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont know about rp but i care about male victims of rape im a prison abolitionist and have demonstrated outside of local prisons for mostly that reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree with your post the most of all good points all around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no he was a normal hetero boy until that point but afterwards essentially became asexual unfortunately we lost touch after high school so i dont know if he ever began dating
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,though id congratulate my son and feel a sense of pride for him youd be devaluing his education for starters wouldnt you be wondering what kind of institution he was going to everyday if he then were to start flunking the class losing interest in his education etc you would change your tune and i know who you would blame then its a pretty blatant crime and a huge abuse of authority if youre serious about your childs education then it wouldnt be tolerable what if she had been giving him alcohol or drugs if the teacher cant respect boundaries then you might have to assume that anything could go
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my husband teaches middle school and high school and if it ever turned out that one of thing teachers seduced him mr arthur would have the school administration and school board wishing that they had never been born the district would probably end up funding exeter tuition for all our kids because he would want them out of that shitty educational environment immediately and forever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i havent looked into it but i have heard that the boys are at greater risk of becoming molesters themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the kid was a high t samoan man with a mustache they are still together and had more kids as far as i know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i know but i wasnt just talking about the legal aspect the way statutory rape between teachers and students sometimes gets treated in the media or online presumes all kinds of emotions and traumas for the victim that might not be there what i meant was that instead of immediately presuming how traumatized the victim probably feels as a kind of reaction to the people saying things like nice or i wish teachers were like that when i was young we should instead just listen open minded to whatever the victim has to say thats what i mean with not forcing more trauma then might actually be there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre probably on a list now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,male gym teacher my point is men arent all that excited about their kids being fucked son or daughter also men tend to view other men as predatory by default
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,male
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but its a biased view
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how do women only get fucked that makes it sound like female sexuality is entirely passive but it takes to tango when my bf is fucking me then yeah im absolutely fucking him back if a chick is literally only laying there as starfish and thinking about her grocery list then id agree that shes just being fucked though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well thats those people for me my opinion stays the same here wether the woman involved is gross and manly or objectively hot i would still see it as my son fucking the teacher and not the other way around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,assuming no stds and no pregnancy too and focusing on just the emotional aspect i think there is still a case to be made that its unfair to the boy i dont want to say its not traumatizing because it could be but i have to admit that mens emotional threshold for sex is lower yes there are plenty of guys that would have liked it that said what if the kid had a perfect slammin hot girlfriend that broke up with him because a teacher or other adult forced herself on the kid and he couldnt say no what if he couldnt get another girlfriend because he got a reputation for having sex with teachers we always think of girls virtue being ruined by sex but i think theres a casr that all younflg peoples virtue matters until they can properly maintain it themselves regardless of gender
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you search it in google its mostly guys saying it was the most pleasant experience in their lives yeah and how many of those stories are true and not just people putting their masturbatory fantasies on the internet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,please explain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah youre not rp i just find it hard to respect rp when they dont practice what they preach like if you care about the way men are negatively impacted by the patriarchy in society maybe you shouldnt try to strengthen that patriarchy maybe you should make a society where men feel like they can report rapes my criticism isnt about individual contributions its about the leaders of the movements and what theyre doing or arent doing i should say to support their supposed causes its great that youre doing that keep at it but youre like one person out of the ten or twenty dissenters on here who actually cares enough to try is a shitty percentage mate plenty of feminists care about those issues and actively campaign to challenge them even if they feel they arent qualified to address them because their movement is specifically meant to address womens issues so why cant rp and the larger mra movement actually attempt to address them when theyre more qualified to do so i dont mind men having a movement to address their own issues in fact i think thats admirable but i think its really shitty that those same men creating a movement for men feel the need to make women feel like their issues dont deserve to be addressed maybe this will get better as these movements get their feet under them but right now it seems like a frothing mess of unaddressed rage thats liable to blow up in any direction see elliot fucking rodger people many of whom are men are dying for no reason and i fail to see how any of these onesided conversations are helping anyone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wouldnt you be wondering what kind of institution he was going to everyday exactly parents should be more concerned with the quality of their teenage kids education than the quality of the pussy theyre slaying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to be honest i already believe school is a rotten institution for so many other reasons pretty much the only reason it makes sense is to socialize your kid and feed them to the wolves so to speak
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think anyone hates the idiots who do this more than other teachers do well except maybe parents i always thought it was gross but after working in schools i feel a visceral rage every time this topic comes up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if he perceived this as being molested sure the question is whether he did the hot teacher seducing her teenaged student isnt a pretty popular of young guys for nothing on the other hand hot women are less likely to be into teenaged boys so this is bound to not happen very often
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,still statutory rape still wrong dont fuck kids even if they have a teenage dirtstache k
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he was not a man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was unnerved by his mustache his family seems pretty normal now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i find your wording intriguing because ive always felt that the person doing the penetration is fucking and the person being penetrated is getting fucked regardless of who it is moving their hips i cringe so hard if a girl says she fucked someone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well then its fucked up slightly less fucked up if my son were gay like the milo situation where its mutual anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,language changes perception if most people use it like he fucked her and she got fucked then the general perception is that women dont really wantneed sex and let men do it to them thats why it should be they fucked or theyve had sex so that women being sexual entities becomes normal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no it has nothing to do with sexuality its all about who gets a dick inside if you use a strapon on your bf youre absolutely fucking him back yes otherwise no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if my son cheated on his gf with teach then id be mad about that its not virtuous but not mad because he had sex with teach which for a boy can be empowering

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the number in a state law does not determine what an adult is sexual maturity does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same here can a wall outlet plug a plug or does the plug plug into the wall outlet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree and thats why i use the latter terminology myself also why i say i shared my virginity instead of gave my virginity the second type of phrasing makes it sound like i had sex as a gift to my bf whereas the first lets the listener know i was an active participant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah fuck is just another way to say have sex with albeit a vulgar one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh my god i would have absolutely lost my shit when i was teaching i knew teachers who friended their students on facebook and instagram went to concerts and other events with them on the weekends texted them etc i couldnt believe it i thought it was wildly inappropriate but admin was apparently aware this kind of thing went on and didnt care ill never forget one time as a young teacher i think i was i went to a party at the house of a friend who was still in college his roommates younger brother was there andit was a kid from my school though i didnt have him in class and he was shitfaced i gfto of there so fast heads were spinning and i never went over there again the thought of interacting socially with a kid from my school literally made me feel sick

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was never a sentimental pussy when it came to women i assure you i would not have fallen for her it would have been me highfiving my bros thinking i was the white notorious big
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i didnt say they were fine there are sound policy reasons for protecting younger people even after puberty and i have no objection to that but i am not going to say post pubertal human adults with developed secondary sexual characteristics are children because thats bizarro land opposite universe of word games
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i didnt even know we had beef or maybe i just forgot im one of those people that has a natural troll personality where the lines between what i believe and what i say are so blurred because of a crippling agnosticism towards everything so dont take me not liking you as a fact even if i say it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where did you get that definition from i just use dictionarycom fuck verb used with object to have sexual intercourse with slangto treat unfairly or harshly verb used without object to have sexual intercourse slangto meddle usually followed by around or with interjection slangused to express anger disgust peremptory rejection etc often followed by a pronoun as you or it noun an act of sexual intercourse a partner in sexual intercourse slanga person especially one who is annoying or contemptible yeah in common usage ive heard men use it most but ive also heard it used by lesbians whore just doing oral stuff and a few hetero women like me who use it towards our men fuck just means sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thank you part time angel of reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im the same i utterly let rip on ugroovyefs when we first spoke but hes a top brass lad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im sorry but your dictionary doesnt cut it especially considering that they would change definitions left and right you know exactly where im getting my definition from and how this word is used if you will you can use your definition in the context that the passive voice applies to women and active to men ps mind you that there are more languages than english translating the word fuck to those languages will show you the same im sure i can only speak for one of course that is my native language but really dont mistake how things are and how you think things should be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah in many ways ugroovyefs reminds me of my younger self complete nihilist acidresearch chem burnout artist type

PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can a wall outlet plug into a plug
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no but those are inanimate objects lol unless youre suggesting we anthropomorphize them as cartoon characters or something in which case surea wall outlet can definitely detach itself from the wall and insert the prongs of its plugfriend into itself with the consent of the plugfriend of course just because he has a hard erect prong doesnt necessarily mean he wants to be plugged at the moment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,legal and social enforcement of monogamy benefits the to of men at the lower end of the value scale otherwise known as betas they offer up resources for sex and reproduction the flip side is that the bottom to of women get access to those resources to raise their children realistically speaking a top guy has no interest in being exclusive with or supporting a lesser female in the bigger picture when there are large swaths of young men not getting laid they tend to create problems with crime and violence in the modern world we dont have as many wars to kill them off so in many cases they are killing each other off in our streets monogamy lines them up with some pussy and a purpose to get a job and provide for her and their offspring it is a much more stable system than polygamy or the free for all that has developed in the western world
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agree with many of your observations less so the ones that draw from current day marginal hunter gatherer societies to make inferences about ancient ones dont agree with your conclusions monogamy is a prerequisite for participation in patriarchal societies patriarchal societies have destroyed assimilated or driven into the margins all their competitors combine this with the fact that evolution has accelerated over the last few centuries and that most humans alive today other than a few isolated mongoloidnegroid tribes are descendants of monogamous cultures and one must conclude that monogamy has had some selective influence people prone to infidelity were simply slaughtered in many abrahamic cultures for instance that had to have something of a genetic pruning effect a little disingenuous to talk about women not benefiting from monogamy when it has such pronounced impact on her progeny western women and in fact most women hailing from cultures that achieved greater than huntergatherer levels of sophistication have enjoyed unparalleled reproductive success under the auspices of monogamous patriarchal culture the protection and provisioning of a monogamous male may be greater than the protectionprovisioning provided by several males polygyny may dilute his resources while serial monogamy or ugh polyandry may inspire less investment by a male men seem more inclined to amass and pass down a large inheritance to children whose paternity he can be relatively certain of if monogamy means your children get to inherit an entire parcel of land and cattle rather than it being split between multiple matrilineal lines who will then feud and slaughter one another then monogamy seems a beneficial deal for the woman perhaps the very reason so many currentday huntergatherer tribes are observed to be egalitarian and relatively sexually unrestricted is selection bias those tribes which had greater propensity for monogamy took the best land pushing their relatively undeveloped sexually unrestricted kin to the margins i question the validity of comparisons between current day hunter gatherer societies who may have been selected for by any number of sociocultural characteristics and our ancestral past if women benefit less from monogamy why do they insist on it you might argue whether its valid but the common perception and cultural narrative is that men are the gatekeepers of commitment while women are the gatekeepers of sex women tend to push for increasing levels of commitment all the way up to and including the lifelong marriage vow and become dissatisfied and insecure when this is not conferred if women were less biologically invested in monogamy than men i would expect the opposite behavior women would be the commitmentphobes while men would fantasize over huge marriage celebrations i pose to you that the material and emotional investment of a man into a monogamous relationship and any children produced thereby is much higher than it would be for an unrestricted relationship that women know this and that they act accordingly just a general point but any calculus of the extent to which women benefit from monogamy should take account of the fact that it virtually guarantees the sexual success of all her male children i also dont really buy that unrestricted sexuality produces the healthiest offspring as one might expect from alphas monopolizing the women is it a coincidence that races which developed highly monogamous culture ex ashkenazi jews whites chinese have higher mean iqs than their savage non civilization developing sexually unrestricted counterparts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tldr dont get fucking married
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what you describe isnt classical rp theory only puas believe that dominating a woman will keep her faithful to you your ability to dominate your social circle is and always has been her acid test no red pill person believes that women are naturally monogamous hypergamy alone makes that impossible as to alpha that is a laugh alphas are dark triad males who are a dead loss when it comes to socially constructive activities including raising their own kids
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if hunter gatherer studies in tropical environments are any indication most women will reproduce with multiple men during their reproductive lives in the eea the evidence we have to this effect is mixed to say the least other current primitive stone age cultures australian s american tended to treat their women like any other goods to be traded with and discarded when no longer useful ie old the available archaeological evidence also seem to point more in this direction and common sense really again archaeological evidence tells us a very large percentage up to of males were killed – the danish national museum is filled to the brim with stone age people who had their skulls smashed in with stone tools or were pierced with arrows etc so we have a society which is very hierarchical and extremely violent and militant – to think that gender relations were based on equality and mutual respect is just silly i know some some feminists like to imagine some past matriarchal golden age where women were free and could have sex with whomever they wanted whenever the wanted and everybody sang happy kumbaya songs about mother earth while sitting around the campfire at night in reality life was probably just never like that at all in any case its unclear whether you mean that polygamy benefit women more evolutionary speaking – or in some other way evolutionary speaking polygamy is not favourable to women and the more extremely polygamous the less favourable few of the hundreds or thousands of wives of kings and emperors ever go to reproduce at all and if they did their offspring were likely to die a soon and violent death at the hands of other jealous wives – especially if she gave birth to a son how many of alexander the greats harem girls do you think got to bear children at all how about zero and even in the cases of less extreme polygamous societies the fathers interest in his offspring is diluted and the energy he can spend on each divided for each additional wife again leading to less favourable outcomes for the womens offspring monogamous societies pre birthcontrol tended to have a higher birthrate in general and fewer children dying before reaching adulthood polygamy is only a favourable institution for the topmen its unfavourable for the remaining men and for all women on the other hand there are a large number of men who are pretty much useless and men have a higher death rate anyway – so it seems to me that the ideal human marriage pattern would be low count form of polygamy most get one wife a sizeable minority get two wives we have some form of this arrangement called serial monogamy – usually successful men marry increasingly younger women but its not a good system for a number of reasons including because it leaves older divorced women in the cold
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just wanted to say that i am saving this ive been trying to say what youve been saying for years but havent been able to with such elegance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lets say women and men are equal in all respects even though i dont agree and women do not need a man for resources company or anything else in this case bottom percent men are indeed better off in enforced monogamy as they get access to sex they would otherwise not have access to however the fallacy you are committing is that you think sex is the only thing that matters when in fact its not sure in the modern slutfest freeforall of contraceptives makeup and fake tits women truly do not need men for they will always have a supply of chads however once a woman starts thinking about the real purpose behind sex courtship relationships and marriage that is having children this is where the bottom percent males come essentially the question is is a woman better off sharing chad with many other women and raising his children almost alone with little to no help from chad or is she better off with a beta bob by her side of course ideally a woman would want to be impregnated by chad and then cuck the bob into raising not his own children but how willing would bob be there probably is a reason most men deeply resent raising some other guys children and feel like its an insult to their masculinity so unless you force percent of men into paying taxes for single mothers it is females that benefit more from monogamy because raising that chad child alone aint easy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is a great post and you are correct that for the bottom of men monogamy is the best hope they have for reproductive potential but this is if we are only looking at reproductive potential in the present day i disagree that this is necessarily beneficial to males firstly people tend to live longer and spend more of their lives in their infertile years than was previously possible offspring are not as necessary to survive in old age as they once were and more males are natural introverts and can enjoy being alone in old age i would argue that being attached to someone of the opposite sex is more beneficial to females than it is for males obviously there are certainly women who are happy going the wgtow route as there are also men who could never be happy with the mgtow route but there is no question in my mind that more men can be happy alone than can women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,serial monogamy has definitely been a part of the manosphere ever since no maam wrote about the year itch it does explain why monogamy has always needed to be enforced maybe heinlein was right maybe we need marriage contracts that expire after years like cell phone contracts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not going to disagree with most of what you said because i think women are more serial monogamist ive seen plenty of this where i live single mothers with kids to different men etc im not sure theyre benefitting from serial monogamy though since most of them end up on benefits or with a low status man as thats all they can attract once they have another mans children while the ones who get married and stay married often achieve a better standard of living ill also point out that society in general benefits from monogamy nonmonogamy leads to more single mothers and im sure were all aware of what a drain they are on society
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ehh but women hate providing for themselves anecdotal evidence but all the girls i know hate having to work their jobs im sure it comes from evolution and the male needed purpose and wanting to provide the lazy fuck males who didnt do it died off however women always got to reproduce unless they were very loyal and their village got taken over but for the most part they always did
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,monogamy at least how some people define it is unnatural expecting someone male or female to be blindly in love with their partner and never lust for other people is total nonsense this doesnt mean monogamous relationships cant work or make people happy even though i dont understand why myself it just means that nobody is naturally monogamous but you can theoretically condition yourself to be and rationalize it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great post but i dont think this in any way disproves the red pill rather its a good point forgotten or misunderstood by anger phasers ive read uatlasbshruggin write about womens natural serial monogamy for literally years now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you talk about these things as though we are supposed to take it for granted that they are facts really you are just making things up edit i like how women are both whores and serial monogamists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive been creeping these subs recently and i very much liked reading your opinion and thought it was very well thought out i agree with you for the most part
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,another day another claim that men and women can all be described by only two sets of instincts you guys never tire of selfreverential intellectual masturbation do you you realize that there are men and women who pair bond to an individual so hard that the thought of leaving even a failure by every objective societal measure simply isnt an option seriously youre going to keep being a joke until you grow up and deal with this like actual adults instead of kids playing dress up social scientist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it does benefit women because how many women can an alpha really support and are betas going to be willing to support the alphas women and children in exchange for sex in a totally patriarchal society where husbands were chosen for daughters by their fathers they werent enforcing monogamy as part of a conspiracy to get betas more pussy they were doing it to ensure the safety of their daughters by getting them a husband who would take care of them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men are polygamous are hypergamous pseudoscience rubbish the reality is that polygamy hypergamy and monogamy are all natural mating strategies of both male and female homo sapiens how successful each is depends entirely on culture era and other external factors
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one of the main things i see misinterpreted is the sexuality of men and women what i will address is the idea that women are monogamous while men are not and men have more to lose from monogamy than women do redpill is based on science but not written in scientific prose it vaguely says male optimal strategy is polygyny and female optimal strategy is hypergamy is your main gripe that redpill should specify that optimal female strategy translates to serial monogamy but not lifelong monogamy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the bigger picture when there are large swaths of young men not getting laid they tend to create problems with crime and violence but they are the ones getting laid and often male street gang members have a lot of sex with girls often street gang girls or girls who hang out in the streets doesnt help the violence just breeds more and more future gang members
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then how come crime rates are on the decline
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,basically blaming terrorism on women now lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,idk thats its true that the top of men arent getting married arguably not all of them are faithful but i find it hard to believe that of men are voluntarily choosing perpetual bachelorhood to marriage these again being the top who have lots of options of high value women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rightthis postreally like are you insinuating those arranged oppressive marriages are better than whats going in in the us
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if women benefit less from monogamy why do they insist on it the monogamy as dictated by modern family law they insist on is not true monogamy but monogamylite where they get to choose when it ends with very little negative consequence compare to century when it was both very difficult to get a divorce and very painful economically to the wife in most places there arent even any consequences to infidelity modern women do not want to commit they want men to commit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women insist on male monogamy they dont want to have sex with just this one man forever they dont insist that they themselves will remain monogamous women do however want perpetual access to his resources regardless of whether they have sex with him or not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only puas believe that dominating a woman will keep her faithful to you your ability to dominate your social circle is and always has been her acid test the point is her sexual attraction is on average limited in time due to her biological imperatives regardless of what you do if she stays it is due to a more familial love not visceral attraction dominating your social circle does little to cultivate familial love it may postpone boredom but it isnt what will compel her to stay long term
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i spent a few years in the bdsm community and they saying i developed was doms dont demand submission they command it which is to say that a guy who is in fact dominant does not need to make a big deal about it while wannabees try to micromanage people most alphas are neither dark triad nor even red pill they will get great jobs and a trophy wife and then perhaps get divorce raped some are red pill and understand this dynamic so they are either very careful or simply dont get hitched only a small percentage are actually dark triad and most of them can be very successful businesswise while leaving a trail of broken hearts in their wake
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is why red pill talks about afbb the af is to get the dominant male with good genes the bb is to get the reliable nice guy who will raise your kids
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is pretty much what i have been saying in this thread if looking at reproductive opportunity alone then op is very much correct but if looking at survival as well then monogamy makes a lot of sense for women i hope that op has not gone into believing feminist revisionist versions of history where men were basically inconsequential for survival if you were to ask those folks they would probably say that if it werent for the necessity of genetic diversity humans would probably do better as a bunch of hermaphroditic selfreproducing women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in old age i would argue that being attached to someone of the opposite sex is more beneficial to females than it is for males but there is no question in my mind that more men can be happy alone than can women really tons of older women are alone because their men died of heart attacks etc they seem to get over it and lead full lives on the other hand when men retire and are home every day many wives hate it because their husbands are the old traditional kind who expect their wives to cook them lunch and clean up after them thats what i see among the retiree generation in my familiesmy friends grandparents
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is to an extent but it is framed as a female betrayal while male polygamy is natural male monogamy is upheld as a sacrifice the traditional skewing terps will use this concept of male monogamous sacrifice as the main capital they bring to their relationship for which she owes deference etc they never address it as a female sacrifice the overarching theme here is that red pill is still a product of male solipsism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpwwwblackdragonblogcom has a theory and cites some peer reviewed research in suggesting that it is about years his solution is to pairbond with a life mate but have an open relationship so he can bang and she can get her chadly alpha cock fix when needed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,look at all the male solipsism in these responses trying to rationalize away their unimportance its hardly an anger phase thing the problem isnt just ignorance of serial monogamy it is the condemnation of female sexual strategy when it deviates from male strategy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,excellent post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is a really damning assessment of female nature i dont really get the criticism of the red pill here though women have to fight against their nature to be monogamous and cant really be trusted because in the end most people are slaves to their nature this is why the red pill teaches to never invest too much into any one woman it is just your turn is a common sentiment in the red pill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who in their right mind would want a harem of year old women in america today over younger women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is the year thing really true i really dont want to fall out of love with anyone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont you forget all these benefits
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the exercise here was to work within red pill parameters without twisting things to build up male status and selfesteem i dont even disagree with you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats part of the reason they turn to violence they see little chance of getting laid as a peaceful little beta so they go where they see a chance of belonging purpose and a chance to be a manly man who gets laid men like hugging better than they like killing but if you take away my access to hugging i will probably start killing just to feel something scott adams
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fewer young men generally more abortions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a mix of the legalization of abortion laws and a reduction of lead in gasoline seriously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one of the main reasons is that we stopped contaminating the environment with lead lead exposure in childhood causes diminished iq and increased proclivity to violence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when weve locked up ridiculous numbers of people for absurd lengths of time gave everyone enough entertainment options to make kings envious legalized abortion took mental health at least seriously enough to provide interventions and treatment and minimized our exposure to lead but weve neglected community and long term stability while regularly scaring the population and pissing on the folks at the bottom that seldom works out well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah the women didnt set up the structure where guys can have lives leaving other guys as incels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most people are blue pill including the top or the alphas and so they will stick the to script and marry the head cheerleader or whomever i have some close friends who would qualify as blue pill alphas tall handsome charismatic and such and they paired up with a quality woman rather than playing the field and are faithful afaik one is a few years into fatherhood and the other is a few decades into marriage i hope for the best and that they can beat the odds such that one of them does not have the world come crashing down around him perhaps only of the or one man in one hundred is quality but a player
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it would be if we view it from an economical and civilizatory perspective
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is better for most males particularly males like him the crux of this post was that rp uses evolutionary theory to support male solipsism and prescribes behaviors intended to benefit males
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,arranged marriages tend to be more stable and have lower divorce rates than what you get in the west even if the arranged married couples move to the west afterwards
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rightthis postreally like are you insinuating those arranged oppressive marriages are better than whats going in in the us theyre only oppressive to your view the men cant divorce without serious repercussions and see the arranged marriage as a union that they really want to make work for their children the women are treated well because they need to be treated well and they typically have a large family support structure on both sides that aides them greatly in life problem is most men are beta so if you do not repress womens sexuality they wont be able to be kept satisfied by most betas and the family is torn apart which does essentially mean for monogamy to work women need to have their sexuality kept in check and not promoted for pleasure if this is not done why even both with monogamy allow for polygamy so the top men can have lots of babies and be there for their several wives and serve as models for their sons and daughters society needs a constant production of children coming from two parent households
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if this was true youd see women cheating much more than men you dont
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,familial love will make a woman stay only if she is traditional to start with women value their children as family not their husbands given the state of laws governing divorce put another way if you are seeking to imply that just starting a family with someone you married will make you less likely to get divorce raped you are mistaken you will lose your family when her feelings inevitably wander as you indicate with the lull when the kids are and be stuck making child support payments for kids you see once in a while marriage is meaningless unless the woman has traditional values and doesnt come from a broken family herself women end up treating their husbands much like their mothers treated their fathers all that besides her n count which limits her intrinsic ability to bond beyond or
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the definition of alpha appears to lie in the eye of the beholder my definition which i insist upon is inconsistent with what you describe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i couldnt have said it better you seem to have understood the post better than most
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,very good points but i will attempt to counter them anyway they seem to get over it and lead full lives sure just like my grandma who doesnt work and lives off my dead grandpas retirement and va money and my gfs grandma who lives of her grandpas retirement and savings not sure how good shape some of these women would be in had it not been for what their husbands did for them before they died combined with what the govt gives them of course on the other hand when men retire and are home every day many wives hate it because their husbands are the old traditional kind who expect their wives to cook them lunch and clean up after them these husbands would do fine on their own if they had to they may not be able to keep a home or cook a meal the way their wives do but most men are perfectly happy with a less wellkept place and with far less presentable meals before i lived with my gf i was happy in a messy studio apartment eating meals that were designed for nutrition and sustenance with little regard for taste and visual presentation living with a woman that just doesnt pass anymore hell im getting way too much salt for my high blood pressure now that the meals have to actually taste good i actually really understand now the plight of the husband who doesnt know where the scissors is because my gf isnt satisfied with my arrangement of the cupboards and drawers and took it upon herself to arrange everything alphabetically or whatever the fuck system she uses its nice having a woman around who likes to cook clean and organize but in many ways i miss having my own place where everything was the way i liked it in many ways i was happier that way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great point this is probably because women are falsely seen as being naturally monogamous while mens preference for multiple partners is pretty wellknown i think the feelings of betrayal men feel comes from their misguided perception of women being naturally monogamous and to their credit this is a perception that women and society as a whole seem invested in upholding and defending
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,male monogamy is a sacrifice for an attractive popular rich guy not to mention down right stupid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wouldnt say that the red pill as a whole is the product of solipsism since much of trp or the manosphere doesnt always really agree on the relationship between the sexes as one of those traditional skewing terps i dont believe that male monogamy is necessarily a sacrifice and i dont believe monogamy puts the woman in any debt to him nor do i believe it debts the man either monogamy is a trade off that both parties make
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,umm because its not like a man can make her raise a child he made with another woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this has been discussed a lot before here usually the man ends up losing out because he cant get women his wife gets whoever she wants
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am not in the habit of telling people what will work best for them i have seen open relationships work and fail at the very least the other every other possible theoretical partner should always be recognized so it can be managed i will say a man who banks on being indefinitely available will probably be sorely disappointed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes trp does things like this its why my flair reads trp core ideas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is the condemnation of female sexual strategy when it deviates from male strategy if you are asserting that trpers fail to abide by the principle or choose to only apply it selectively that sexual strategy is amoral you wont hear any argument from me that represents a major issue i have with a lot of trpers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,female sexual strategy is amoral this is just as damning towards males by pointing out males desire for multiple partners simultaneously not very sweet is it the only difference is that some approximation of female sexual strategy is always realizable while for males it is rarely realizable and even when it is only for a certain window of time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,walter seventytwo virgins why not slutty broads who know what the hell theyre doing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this post must either be too long and boring for you to read above your level of reading comprehension
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,longterm monogamous couples remain together by finding ways to appreciate and love their partner without the dopamine that accompanies the first four years i doubt my aging parents are getting much dopamine by being together anymore but they still enjoy each others company and im sure they couldnt imagine a life without each other many other couples are not that way though and often find they would rather not be together anymore after the dopamine dissipates modern systems of dating and marriage offer an easy exit when that happens
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is pull a romeo and juliet if you dont want to die an embittered slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah that sounds horrible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a dark quote coming from a comic strip creator lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but theres a shortage of men in communities with street gangs because the men keep getting imprisoned even unattractive men shouldnt have difficulty getting someone on the other hand a fuckton of incels are from nice neighborhoods in the suburbs and essentially none of them join street gangs i suspect there is a different problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you saying men are becoming violent criminals to get laid as in they are making a conscious decision for that reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol this makes sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,incels are a problem i guess since we all have a basic need for acceptance and validation and sex and comfort i think theres a solution for the incel problem as technology moves forward but it will take some clever engineers with the time and money to do it because honestly making sure incels are fufilled on a sexual and emotional level seems to be a low priority issue in the world but yeah idk i feel like theres a possible future where this problem does get solved
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about humanitarian howd you feel if you were an oppressed woman do you even understand how bad it is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wow too bad males arent the only type of people in the world right selfish
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which very few people seem to understand lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre kidding right gee i wonder why an oppressive arranged marriages tend not to end in divorce really what a mystery
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,two things women know that if they cheat they very well could lose access to the resources hence laws passed to give divorced women an income stream in the form of child support sure shell get some of the resources but she wont have access to all of them she could kill the goose that lays the golden eggs women fear judgment and rejection if they cheat repeatedly even after selecting one man they risk judgment of other women as a mate poacher and as standing against the herd they fear getting kicked out of the female herd women fear and hate negative judgment and rejection more than they want to cheat with hot men after marrying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women cheat differently than men whereas men want to fuck multiple women from the very beginning and most attempt to repress this in order to stay monogamous women other than the sluttiest of them will desire shortterm monogamy with a man she is attracted to and will generally feel little need for multiple partners until years into the relationship when the dopamine runs out then she will be excited by alpha cock in order to stay monogamous she will have to fight these urges this is one reason men are often caught offguard by womens cheating the same woman who used to have eyes only for him is suddenly bored by him sexually and looks elsewhere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for trp the definition is right in the sidebar socially dominant somebody who displays high value or traits that are sexually attractive to women alpha can refer to a man who exhibits alpha behaviors more alpha tendencies than beta but usually used to describe individual behaviors themselves some lines of though on trp will advise to emulate dark triad traits because they are attractive to women criminality itself is not an alpha trait but risktaking bravado nonconformance are and it depends on the criminal in question
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok but if we were to look instead at times long ago when hard physical labor was necessary for the survival of most men and women of common means i would still argue that your post only applies specifically to reproductive opportunity a woman having a man provide for her through his physical labor was essential for the majority of women thus the trade of reproductive opportunity for provisioning to put it otherwise a man in those times could potentially survive alone in a hut in the woods through his huntergathereragricultural ability only the most exceptionally fit and strong women would be able to do so i am saying that ability to survive and ability to procreate are two separate matters and that your post addresses specifically the latter
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are drastically overestimating the degree of direct paternal investment necessary for a child to survive after it passes toddlerhood you are drastically underestimating the amount of collective raising of children in tribal societies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a man should only agree to it if he is a toptier man who knows he can easily get other women such a man probably already has women lined up before he opens up the marriage so yeah for the vast majority of men open marriage is not a good idea their wife will be having a lot more sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i will say a man who banks on being indefinitely available will probably be sorely disappointed probably but the ability for older guys to pull much younger women is underestimated by most guys will a lot of guys be able to pull it off maybe not but it isnt that much of a pipe dream i have a friend a recently single dad in his latethirties who is youthful goodlooking and cool he actually has a not insignificant number of twentysomethings who clearly find him attractive but he has a difficult time believing it and i think he may be feeling a little intimidated andor guilty so he doesnt avail himself but he totally could im a fairly average guy who stayed youthful cool and in good shape into my early forties i slept with more twentysomethings in my latethirties than i did when i myself was a twentysomething and i had many friends doing the same it isnt that hard to pull off though it does take a concerted effort its not as easy as just showing up as a typical paunchy middleaged suburbanite wearing a tshirt and cargo shorts younger women seemed to appreciate the opportunity to fuck around with an older mature ha sophisticatedworldly man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is that realizable in modern society
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only difference is that some approximation of female sexual strategy is always realizable while for males it is rarely realizable and even when it is only for a certain window of time define realizable female sexuality has been restricted for millenia now as for male it seems quite realizable to have a goodly sized harem for every male so long as there is constant warfare both internecine and between polities kill off a good portion of your own young men kill off an entire citystate full of hostile men and convert all their women to slaves still too many men left civil war will take care of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well yeah guys have to fight their nature too i dont recommend long term monogamy to anyone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one of my close friendscoworkers swears that this hes is the best hookup hes ever had he says he would never seriously date a girl more than a couple years older than him and that number goes up with his own age but he also says this older one knows what the fuck is up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is your best contribution to the thread when women fall in love that love is relatively unmitigated by lust compared to the average mans since she is not lusting after men on the street except for occasionally a highly attractive man if we keep telling women to seek a man they are passionate about thinking this will lead to a longer lasting and more passionate relationship it can cause her to choose categorical behaviors of men who are more exciting but that excitement will not last anyway to boot those men do not make viable long term partners generally to cultivate familial love the man must be of service to reinforce those positive feelings even red pill advice geared at women ignores this truth in favor of a lie that is convenient to the male ego if the man is alpha enough her passion will remain if she is highly attracted to him at the inception of the relationship she will remain so its having a full blown heavy petting session with a lie when we shield women from the truth about themselves they can at least choose to enter relationships with a reasonable idea of what will result and exit relationships with full knowledge of the actual reasons for their actions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because thats not extreme
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,have you seen his blog his ideas are considered pretty radical by the mainstream you should see some of his views on sexuality trump isis etc httpblogdilbertcom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would say that men pursue power to get women cue scarface and the iconic in this country first you get the money then you get the power then you get the woman line for many men at certain levels of society violent criminal is the most viable path to the requisite power
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no in most cases it probably isnt conscious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,roe v wade was decided in within a couple of years women had rather open access to abortions crime rates started falling in the early right when all those abortions would have become dysfunctional teenagers raised by single mothers crime rates have been falling ever since then in north america anyways
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fewer children born into families that didnt want them andor mistreated them those things being unwanted and mistreated as a kid are strong predictors of future criminal behavior
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the strengethened economy and technological advancement will help fight poverty hunger and reduce crime if it means separating women from their beloved alpha cock id say its worth it also the current soft harem structures oppresses lots of men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont really disagree with you in that im not all about bringing arranged marriages back but arranged marriages dont necessarily oppression of women the way that they take place in the contemporary east ive mostly read about india tbh but have seen references to the rest of the region including the middle east pretty much resembles blind dating set by ones parentsfamily basically from what i understand of it its become standard procedure to have families set people up and then they meet several times more if they like each other and mutually decide whether or not to get married many women try for love marriagesto find their own partner and when they get older and lonely are like okay parents its time to step in and save me from dying alone the pictures pretty complex im not sure arranged marriage under these sorts of conditions is really as evil or antithetical to womens lib as it may on the face of it initially seem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why should we care without oppressing women no society no society no computer for you to burble out words if you could be trusted with your own pussies things might be different but sadly you cant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you just had to stick oppressive in there didnt ya
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because theyre better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so basically youre admitting women do have reasons to remain monogamous and are more monogamous than men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not the point if women were ultimately the ones demanding monogamy without providing it wed have more women cheating period theres no way to reconcile these two beliefs if she leave him and eventually moves onto another man thats still not cheating
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,since we know what women actually are attracted to i dont see a contradiction
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in most environments prior to the neolithic revolution women obtained most of the calories consumed through gathering the model to which you are referring is armchair anthropology that didnt hold up once hunter gathers in tropical environments were actually studied people have measured the wear on their teeth picked up their poop and sent it to labs lived with them for years etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not about men losing their resources its about men thinking they reproduced when they actually didnt men who werent suspicious and didnt care about women fucking around mostly died out and left the gene pool
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she can marry one man divorce him and marry another or she can cohabitate with a man dump him and move in with another she could do this unceremoniously for most of human prehistory she might share this man but that doesnt seem to bother hunter gatherer women so much as to prevent them from choosing it if she preferred a monogamous man shed have a wider selection rather than her approximate class and attractiveness bracket even during much of western history poor people separated and recoupled at higher rates than some nostalgic types would lead you to believe even if this werent the case abrahamic western history is a small blip on the screen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not everyone is a slut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,setting aside porn stars women in their dont know how to give a good blow job
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is your best contribution to the thread no it isnt its just the most bp thing ive said in the thread
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thanks for the link
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not surprised at all dilbert is always about going against corporate america and the bureaucracy people just make the mistake of associating corporate and bureaucracy with right wing republicans but forgetting that the democrats are as much as corporate bureaucratic and part of the establishment as well the people in the dnc chating vote wall street lock her up and goldman sachs just warms my heart
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so do you think that crime rates will start rising in the us now thats theres been a large campaign to do away with abortion clinics particularly in the south
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,an arranged marriage doesnt have to be oppressive but most cultures which typically ha e arranged marriages are oppressive and treat the women as second class citizens
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wrong did you know the first ever programmer was a woman so if women were not gaining more rights over time then she wouldnt have been able to do that and computers would probably not developed the same way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes because not all arranged marriages are happier and healthier infact many of them suck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wrong because the cant afford not to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they dont want to have sex with just this one man forever they dont insist that they themselves will remain monogamous they have reasons to remain monogamous women who do remain monogamous do so because they are incentivized to do so more and more women an increasing number are cheating though women are not more monogamous than men by some research female cheating has pulled even with male cheating
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no womens cheating almost always happens after shes had her monogamous guy for a few years thats why it seems more rare and surprising in fact ill go ahead and give it to you that male cheating is more common since men are prone to do it through pretty much all stages of a relationship unlike women none of this conflicts with the idea that women demand monogamy in fact it supports it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,simply looking at who provided the bulk of calories is not a great indicator of the relative importance of male vs female labor food acquired through hunting is more nutritious protein rich generally more desirable hunting is linked to status in huntergatherer societies and meat is generally shared which means when you fall on tough times you can still count on other men youve hunted with to split some of their meat with you these calories can prevent starvation when tough times set in ie winter and foraging efforts fail if meat is available of the time and foraging only provides food of the time hunting is still much more important to survival despite relative caloric intake
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so are you saying women didnt need mens labor in order to survive thats laughable why did they even get married in the first place then when they could have just fucked a chad and then raised his kids on her own it is only modern welfare and child support that have made that a possibility even if you think an ablebodied woman was perfectly capable of taking care of herself throughout history that still ignores the provisioning she would require during the later stages of pregnancy or the additional provisioning a young child would need
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wait but i thought women were oppressed historically does it change depending on the narrative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she can marry one man divorce him and marry another hmm according to that divorce data that doesnt happen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no need their other holes are still prime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for one it aint gonna happen and for two that will be another years down the road at which point i will be sipping vodka martinis on a beach somewhere and generally not giving a fuck check out freakonomics for the full report on this idea
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its all a matter of perspective you havent been a woman in an arranged or traditional marriage either you cant assume to speak for them just because you are from a more enlightened culture a woman in an arranged marriage may very well claim to be happier that way the women in those cultures will defend their tradition to the grave and actively participate in it by being matchmakers also men in those cultures can sometimes be unhappy with their arranged matches as well the system isnt unilaterally shitty for women and great for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not going to go backwards so if i were you id start thinking forward trp is forwards its the acknowledgement that for better it worse women are free so we need to readjust our priorities accordingly this basically amounts to swapping out gathering as many resources as possible for becoming as attractive as possible and avoiding emotional investment in sexual relationships
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wrong did you know the first ever programmer was a woman so if women were not gaining more rights over time then she wouldnt have been able to do that and computers would probably not developed the same way please she contributed to the field of programming it by no means someone else wouldnt have done it pretty soon after its like saying if darwin didnt discover evolution no one else would silly argument women have contributed but if they hadnt men would have and if society better focused resources on men it would be more effective and more would be gain since men have higher potential
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as if most love marriages are happy theyre actually far less stable because it relies on the man knowing what hes doing even more and it relies on the woman self controlling her awalt mechanics without the help of religion and society very difficult
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i fail to see how you can reconcile your view that women insist on men being monogamous while not being monogamist themselves with the data even if youre looking at the one study that found cheating is on par with men it seems to me if women are so insistent on monogamy from men but not themselves the logical conclusion would be women cheat moreso than men which isnt the case and never has been according to the data
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it conflicts with the idea that its more in womans nature to cheat than mans
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and i was going to add that hunting doesnt only provide food prior to the invention of textiles and also before they were readily available animal hides and furs were essential for survival in colder environments as clothing and were often used to make shelter as well also even if hunting was done primarily by males and gathering was done primarily by females males greater strength and stamina made them better at both of them how are we to know that males didnt also help with gathering especially during seasons and in places where gathering was a more efficient means of getting food i can imagine that a female collective in a milder climate where gathering can provide sufficient food could survive without men but in many environments male cooperation would be essential and in all environments male cooperation would provide superior access to food and necessary provisions for survival and if were talking about a singular person trying to survive on their own without collective assistance from a tribe this would be practically impossible for a female but possible for a male thats why women pair bonded to secure the protection and provisioning of a male for herself and her offspring
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the provisioning required for child rearing has been addressed its just that there appears to be no advantage of being with the male for life only until the child has been weaned and requires less momenttomoment care this cycle was addressed in the post once this occurs the woman would pair bond with another male just as easily as the first and is in fact inclined to do so with a unique male as ubetterdeadthanbeta has said meat is perishable and shared females in the eea were getting some level of provisions from multiple men simultaneously in addition to providing most of the calories themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never said women were oppressed historically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you mean it never happens yeah i know you meant thats not what usually happens sure but even if a woman never gets remarried she will often have a boyfriend or a living situation with another man hell my old widowed grandmother has a male friend who is basically her male companionship and everybody knows it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for one it aint gonna happen and for two that will be another years down the road at which point i will be sipping vodka martinis on a beach somewhere and generally not giving a fuck wait are you saying that abortion clinics being shut down in the south aint gonna happen because uh it is happening
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure im not one of those women but ive read the first hand experiences of these women and have enough empathy and imagine to ache for them its definitely not just bad for women and id never suggest this but there seems to be a strong opinion that women need this or prefer this and its wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not a retard feminist actually sure i understand theres a spectrum that doesnt mean you can go and say that the other side is better off simply put they arent and your statistics are meaningless isis style marriages arent actually a new thing just a more extreme version of something thats still very very bad even if you cant wrap your head around it you want to compare modern western society to western society in the is very different than historical oppression from an old era that still manifests itself today in all over the freaking world those are different conversations entirely to have you cant deny the issues feminism fought so hard against in western society you cant say that those old cultures have it better you cant do it why because it actually makes very little sense womens happiness has been declining is totally irrelevant ask most women today if theyd prefer the old system over this one and youll get a resounding no even though like you said it is better from a socioeconomic perspective while all well and good for thought the truth of the matter is that women are treated as second class citizens for most of history and still today feminism is necessary to equalize that and make us first class citizens like men there are of course negatives along with the positives that arise from this change in my opinion feminism overshot the goal and has strayed far away from what it intended to do we need to adjust that for sure which is why i said look forward the past is the past there is no conceivable way it will go backwards at the moment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this isnt forwards at all because its entirely selfish and doesnt consider a life for a child and future generations instead of viewing the gender issues as a war and its one side verses another we should as a society be discussing these issues so that we can have harmony in relationships and offspring that are thriving trp doesnt do that it concerns itself with the present not the future
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well the gap has closed significantly but there still exists cultures that are backwards that are trying to break free from those constraints i personally have never felt like a second class citizen but i know some people are treated like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ehh not all men have a higher potential
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not impossible though i think we could bring back some stuff from the old way like classes to help women and men understand what it means to be in a relationship
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a man being monogamous to a woman while the woman is not monogamous to the man is the almost ideal condition for the woman the fact that its rarely present cuckoldry is pretty rare is another story women would like that fairytale to be true because their sexual strategy thrives while the male is non existent if we throw afbb into the above reasoning we can link both af and bb to the two relationship statuses above if the man is monogamous to the woman the bb part is secured the woman has the resources to live and raise her children if the woman is polygamous simultaneously she can choose freely the best genes she can find the af part checks out i think pems first comment intends to picture that there is a drive towards that sort of behavior although the example relationship is rarely possible due to the fact that sexual strategies need to stay in some type of equilibrium sure the past few decades this balance has shifted into womens favor but were very far away from the total female sexual strategy dominance so figuratively speaking this drive would push the balance in womens favor but that drive is working against the other male drive thats trying to get its piece of cake too this sounds really new age but all this means is that both genders need to have mutual benefits from a relationship for it to work lets get back to the first example the man monogamous to the polygamous woman gets nothing he expends resources yet gets nothing in return the benefits are really one sided for the woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that was never the claim being made the claim was that women demanded it without being able to follow through with it men on the other hand may not be able to follow through with it but are not usually the ones demanding it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then there is no need for feminism to exist additionally if your theory holds true then most of the men alive today are products of alpha males since of women reproduced and lived in polygamous harems with alpha males
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so her husband died and she still cant see anyone else without you judging her no i meant never happens amalt all marriages are like that after all a majority state defines the rest everyone knows that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is happening i know they are gunning for some of the worst examples but really to what extent is it happening
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant say definitely which one actually makes women or men happier its hard to compare since people will usually just say they prefer their own cultures way the original point made by uultramegasaurus was that it was better for the survival and functioning of society as a whole it wasnt really about which made people more happy if you look at it from a ruthlessly economical perspective without regard for happiness then there is a compelling case for traditional marriage and enforced monogamy this is something that is discussed on trp a lot though the chads on trp will usually say they personally prefer the current system as it allows them to enjoy having multiple sexual partners
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it just means im going to have to convert to some fundemental christian sect or mormonism to find a good wife
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we used to care only for others most men do it comes naturally as a protector role have enough of those guys who are shit on for their efforts eventually they decide to say fuck it what youre describing is the purearchy its not unrelated to trp more of an older brother it most certainly likes the future low reward living deferring reward eg lifting all kinds of future thinking the only difference is the vagina is no longer at the end of the tunnel they are the puddles you splash through while on your way dont blame us blame your mom and her shitty example of friends for the change plus your crappy friends that used to leave birth control pills on the coffee table when you come over because they were funny and they were slobs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,none of this is going to happen until the how do we get sex question is satisfactorily answered for the majority of men thats a tier maslow hierarchy need so its going to take precedent over the upper level needs like future planning for families the vast majority of the time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why should men concern themselves with the future when women are similarly concerned with the here and now getting that alpha cock and updating their social media pages
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ehh not all men have a higher potential so the sum of men have higher potential than the sum of women resources and a society geared towards maximizing men leads to more potential being reached
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not impossible though i think we could bring back some stuff from the old way like classes to help women and men understand what it means to be in a relationship understanding is not what women like to do or really do well women learn and change behavior by conditioning primarily we need shame to keep sexual desires in check and marriages together women like to take any given argument or data and find the outliers focus on them rather than understand in concrete logical ways how things are and build from there truth is fluid to women not concrete
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you think men dont demand monogamy there was a study done on cheating i linked here once which found of men and women both believe they should be sexually faithful in a relationship and expect their partners to be faithful what percentage of men do you think arent expecting this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this post was not about feminism it was about red pill rationalizations based on evolutionary theory vs the evolutionary theories in the absence of male solipsism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,judging is such a harsh word everyone in my family thinks its funny that she has a boyfriend but wont just admit it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the number of abortion clinics in texas the second most populous state in the country was between and there are two abortion clinics for the entire western half of the state and keep in mind texas is huge it also happens that that half of the state is the most povertystricken meaning women there are much less likely to be able to take time off work texas requires four doctors visits for an abortion and afford to travel now theres legislation in the works in texas that would require abortion clinics to give fetuses a proper burial or cremation instead of disposing of them as medical waste this legislation is ostensibly about the dignity of human life and in texas its likely to pass if it does this expense will make it difficult or impossible for the few clinics left to remain in operation i used texas as an example because its where i live and the state im most familiar with but its happening everywhere even liberal states like california
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think good wives are born they are created meaning that yes converting to some older ideology would increase your chance of finding a good wife since those older ideologies place a much greater focus on being a good wife than modern society does so its honestly not even a bad idea i bet its very hard as a man to see how bad it is with there being no values taught to women because men know they cant change it as their complaints fall upon the deaf ears of women who ultimately are the ones who need to be listening i can tell you my personal journey was that before trp i never considered what it takes to be a good girlfriend or a good wife once i realized that my looks vagina made me very valuable to a guy it was easy subconsciously to devalue him and disrespect him knowing that he would have a hard time finding other women where as i would not have a hard time finding other men this mentality took a year relationship and flushed it down the drain although ex always said to me that id leave him i was commited to him but he became less commited to me because my behaviour did not give him the incentive to work harder on the relationship i was heavily invested in the relationship and hurt when it ended because i simply couldnt understand what i had even done wrong at all i mean im not the only one at fault here but there was definitely a change in my mentality when i found trp i found trp months into a new relationship which from what i remember started at gloriously but my ugly qualities began to rear its head again and because of that he started to withdraw but i found trp and read it poured over material became angry not at men but at myself because i read it and knew it was true and i started to change and it wasnt easy but i made a great effort into changing i think that was not just because of trp but also because as you get older and more mature you start thinking differently trp definitely helped be a catalyst for that change issue is trp is too raw for most women and wont be a catalyst for change so in my opinion we could create a different catalyst for women in the past these were those ideologies but those ideologies are not required for a relationship simply put trust communication kindness compromise admitting your wrong introspection and seeing yourself as equal to not above your partner is really what makes a relationship last prioritizing their needs is what can make you a good wife and a good girlfriend in a society that greatly prioritizes the individual above all else it is no surprise there is a lack of relationships that are healthy and thriving for both people what is needed is a catalyst for change for women to realize what is required for a relationship to work much like the catalyst that was feminism that helped men realized that women want the same things as men do and have the right to pursue those goals and men do not have the right to control them or decide for them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think both men and women are to blame to think that one group is entirely responsible is foolish both men and women need to take responsibility
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this x
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,none of this is going to happen until the how do we get sex question is satisfactorily answered for the majority of men thats a tier maslow hierarchy need so its going to take precedent over the upper level needs like future planning for families the vast majority of the time prostitution would be more than sufficient without it legalized we treat our women like prostitutes and tell them to be so through the media alternatively we could have a powerful religion that oppressed our sexuality on both sides but this is less optimal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a women who isnt like that thats why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why should men concern themselves with the future when women are similarly concerned with the here and now getting that alpha cock and updating their social media pages because civilization is created by and created for men this is all mens fault and men suffer the worst of it most women do not have agency they know not what they do no woman devalues their sexuality knowing what its worth and why she feels the way she does she devalues it because of conditioning not active logical thought process
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah they are forsure rights
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,resources and a society geared towards maximizing men smart people leads to more potential being reached ftfy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,understanding is not what women like to do or really do well right so it totally makes sense to hold back all women because some of them fail to understand things while others work hard for understanding women learn and change behavior by conditioning primarily we need shame to keep sexual desires in check and marriages together and men need shame to keep their sexual desires in check and not rape women makes sense women like to take any given argument or data and find the outliers focus on them rather than understand in concrete logical ways how things are and build from there truth is fluid to women not concrete this is just a bunch of words exceptional people are still exceptional truth is fluid to women means what exactly are all men born knowing the truth of everything and it never changes that definitely explains the male stubbornness and unwillingness to accept opinions that counter their world view sucks to be put in a box right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think the point was that women demand monogamy first they push for commitment and marriage when already in a relationship then yes obviously men demand monogamy too duh that goes without saying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,blame is for children to suss out one could care less whose fault it is thems the situations deal with it accordingly asking a woman to take responsibility sound good but to the xx ears it sounds like a character assassination and does no good
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you first
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,idk im happy to take responsibility if it means a future of happiness with a man i love
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,already have mate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,again would make you a pleasant exception to the rule i already know you are constantly sloughing off at work on reddit so perhaps a man who brings home bacon will be a good thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,prove it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah thats not true maybe a few times a week i work hard so its not constant i make more money than he does atm edit mostly in the toilet which i have to visit frequently due to my stomach issues
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im committed to making sure my so gets as much out of the relationship as i do the relationship is not solely for my benefit i take responsibility to make sure that we both benefit and are happy i listen when hes unhappy ill adjust when im wrong no one is perfect and i recognize that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youre saying you lied to me two days ago when you got pissed you were wasting your time that you could have been spending working and then to blame your shitty diet for shame
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats good
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have crohns disease dude i didnt lie i was wasting my time writing out a response because in order to make up for the time id have to work longerharder later that afternoon which i did if im on reddit i like to have discussions if i write out a reply which doesnt get read its a waste of my time i dont use reddit as a diary i use it as a communication tool
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have crohns disease dude self diagnosed or real i hope real otherwise your shaming tactic wont work one thing rp is good for is explaining a concept called deer want a communication tool its a good one remember im a random asshole on the net youre the one now justifying your bowel movements to me on a thread about women complaining about cat calls and a country bumpkin who doesnt believe it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have crohns too high five i guess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oooooh chrohns is ruthless so sorry to hear about that gi disease rivals srs burns in suffering potential imo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont care what i have to justify i am not a liar i like having truthful discussions if you dont believe me or feel im being contradictory ill try to provide the context and explanation to help you understand my perspective you want to discredit me because you think im slacking off ill try to prove im not you want to claim i blame my shitty diet i can only do so much to prevent my disease from wreaking havoc on my body and right now the worst symptom i have is frequent and urgent bathroom use which is not so bad compared to my worst times you want to even go so far as to suggest im making up my disease ill make sure get a picture of how real it is i dont care how the conversation has diverged i googled for deer the red pill and didnt see anything so if you could elaborate it would be nice i like having conversations on these topics you dont believe stuff thats fine ill try to get you to believe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah were not alone hope youre doing well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,makes sense since i feel like my insides are burning a lot of the time thanks for your concern it does affect my life severely but thankfully i have an excellent support group between family boyfriend even my employer and coworkers get me its nice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,defend excuse explain rationalize also tmi
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have taken care of patients with gi issues they are a different sort of tough from all angles so hard to pinpoint and treat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,op please add text in your post sufficient to explain the linked material we do not allow linkdropping post thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why is a gay man giving heterosexual dating advice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,barely into the video but is he gay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i do not think im the target audience for his videos
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what about the whole thing about not asking a fish for fishing advice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,neck game is strong he looks like a rugby player if i were faust then id sell myself to the devil for a neck like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i adore him im a girl he says some really true and honest stuff that completely made me a better person as well as a better girlfriend i just wonder sometimes if hes gay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,afaik hussey is a former pua who makes good enough money teaching chicks hes a true outlier in the pua community
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i find him watchable and not disagreeable overall and i find the questions on his sexual orientation to be amusing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some of his stuff is good have friends who love his videosone thing i remember and resonated w me from his videos is that relationships are built moment by moment likelittle links in a chain you can string a series of pleasant interactions together to make a stronger relationship so basically hes saying stay in the moment and pay attention to the interaction in front of you because it is an ever unfolding opportunity to build the sort of relationship you want even if the past links were all rusted and rotted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he does a great job of describing the women trp wants to attract also calling those women out if only trp had the balls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,exactly hes been living on gay island all his life do you think hes ever even talked to straight people as trp constantly reminds us theres no value in an objective observer or at least theres none if theyre just going to say something trp doesnt want to hear anyways edit wait hes not actually a gay guy thatll teach me to assume the first comment in ppd has any relevance to the topic sighs guess now ill have to actually watch the video instead of just pointing out basic logical fallacies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he looks like someone with a lot of experience in getting men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha he does look gay tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,cant say ive ever felt that way in my marriage but it helps to marry someone you crave and venerate monogamy is a keystone value for me so i keep my head down eyes locked on my husband and treat other men as asexual humans hm at the year markour most pressing issue was economic both working shitty service industry jobs but i never felt a strain distance or loss of attraction by circumstance we relied on each other a lot and became fairly bonded in the process sex was still frequent and passionate so we readily adopted an us against the world mindset however prior to my husband my longest relationship was years after the year mark i felt like things were going down hill but at the time i attributed it to the fact that he was in afghanistan for a majority of the relationship not sure if i would conclude that the reason that relationship fizzled was because of the or year itch but more so that we were young and not at all ready for an army ldr
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my good friends and i were left by our spouses and one fiancé at it was surreal looking back on it two women left me and my friend for other men one left our friend for another woman in each situation it was this your partner was shit to begin with and you were blinded by dopamine and ignorant of what women were willing to waste for feels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,years and my hormones were raging for new pussy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wouldnt call it the four year itch but a few years after my partner and i started dating i would get little crushes on people i still do i dont see it as a harmful thing it makes me giddy and flirty and then i bring that energy home to him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,at about years i developed a crush on a friend my partner and i were in a ldr and the friend reminded me of him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive had one relationship that lasted longer than four years so far and i didnt experience anything like that but i was deep in depression so things were different then i am on my fourth year with my current gf right now and so far there is nothing like whats described in the op but i dont think it would apply to us anyway since were not monogamous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i caught the twoyear itch i broke out into a rash everytime i saw his dirty socks and underwear wet and squashed into a corner of the bathroom or the kitchen messy when it was his time to shine i jettisoned him it was a wonder i lasted two years with the slob some other woman can be his mother
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive experienced it in every relationship ive been in at around the year mark
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no every divorce ive known personally was more around years like your median and off the top of my head i cant think of many four year relationships most of mine and friends and family are either shorter like years or much longer than
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive been with my partner for and a half years now have never been in an ltr with anyone but him just a couple of strs with girls growing up really and didnt get the itch im very much the nesting type though so the increasing stability of our relationship has fed into my satisfaction with it rather than detracting from it i dont know whether my partner feels the same i know he was quite promiscuous when he was younger so it wouldnt surprise me particularly if hed occasionally considered other options if he has though he hasnt acted on any those doubts and were still going strong as far as im aware
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah around years in wife really started treating me like shit i dont know if she cheated wouldnt be surprised one bit if she did but looking back the whole four year itch thing makes sense and explains her behavior our kid was about years old she was miserable in pretty much every way she was taking care of an infant and breastfeeding i was working all the time and gone frequently she was getting no sleep and i was at my omega worst the more she complained the harder i worked to make her happy if she had told me it would make her happy for me to push a dime across the kitchen floor with my nose i would have done it if she had told me it would make her happy for me to sleep in the downstairs bedroom and never to have had sex with her again i would have done it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i get a little irritable if i dont get new pussy at least every couple months or so i try to be proactive in this regard because my game is way better when im not thirsty af girlfriend doesnt care so long as i find girls interested in her too im more concerned about what shell be like at year ill cross that bridge when i come to it i guess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,got within an inch of opening pandoras box but stopped literally or figuratively
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my wife is a saint and there wasnt a damn thing wrong with her nothing wrong with her but plenty wrong with the one partner for life prevalent social norm people think that you need to somehow fail in order for your partner to get an urge to cheat or vice versa this is not really necessary just a convenient excuse
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it makes me giddy and flirty and then i bring that energy home to him ewww id rather my girlfriend kicked me in the balls than she brought back home to me the giddy flirty energy that another man inspired in her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol nothing guarantees infidelity like an ldr youd think people wouldve learned by now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think it would apply to us anyway since were not monogamous yeah four year itch doesnt rly apply to someone scratching and rubbing themselves on everything in sight like a louse infested house cat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,those things were there the whole time it just took that long to realize it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it took you so long to realize it because he was a sexy alpha hunk and you overlooked his flaws as long as he made your giney tingle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like your flair
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when the female starts getting niggardly hmm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpwwwrochesteredunewscentercomebabyrelightfire
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think its a little naive to think your girlfriend doesnt notice other men unless shes not a very sexual person odds are she does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except there was no infidelity i got a little crush realised what had happened and distanced myself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont do that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i pretty much know that his underwear was starting to appear in corners of the bathroom pretty early on in the marriage he held off for the first few months but then he let his slob flag fly at full mast
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or she told him over and over again in the hopes that he learns one day but then accepted that hes never going to improve
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah i tried to make the marriage work i dont give up easily his mess bested me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not fully im a work in progress so is she but its much much better i dont just say i was misled and lied to i was misled and lied to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,being nice and things like that are not necessarily based on who the partner is and what the partner really wants birnbaum says when a mate is truly responsive the relationship feels special and unique and he or she is perceived as valued and desirable fuck that solution marital rape all the way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres a difference between noticing that you find someone attractive and focusing on that attraction to the point that it affects your mood for the rest of the day i expect my girlfriend to banish any disloyal thoughts as soon as possible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not saying i dont believe you but i am saying that for every times a woman says that times its trickle truth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a metaphor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that just sounds unbearable how ever did you survive in such a dangerous hellhole
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,till death do us part or if youre messy sounds legit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,together we will reign over an army of incel goblinmen and hypergamous shedevils for four years at least
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you do that do you actively try to not fantasize about other women than your so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thought policing has never worked for me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when i backpacked through europe in my twenties i learned a lot about american college girls that all had boyfriends at home while they studied abroad it was one of the funnest times of my life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a crappy one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep certainly grounds for terminating a marriage your wedding vows can only go so far
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i know i cant even
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not to pry but did your wife immediately notice the change and panic not exactly i didnt initially show anything i did something thats really not recommended in mrptrp practice and i wouldnt recommend anyone else do it i told her that she couldnt treat me like shit anymore and that she needed to stop doing it immediately and if she didnt then i was going to divorce her then she panicked thats not recommended because i did it from the position of having done no self improvement having changed nothing about myself it was only after i said that that i started getting better at the time i dropped that ultimatum i had no leverage at all ultimatums are betaomega shit anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i try i wont say im perfect at controlling my thoughts but i think im far better than most men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have high standards
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can totes picture a travel ad targeted at college aged females a blonde is texting her boyfriend back in the states oh im not up to much just staying in with my girlfriends then a calloused manly hand covers hers and a luxurious make out session begins tagline would be something like paris where it just happens
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought it was spot on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how would you describe it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,at the time i dropped that ultimatum i had no leverage at all ultimatums are betaomega shit anyway nah id just call that keeping it real believe it or not you did have the power ultimately the one who cares less is the one who holds the reigns right then and there it was you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some might even say unreasonable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for some reason choosing paris as the destination for that ad seems very funny to me i dont think of paris as a fuckfest what with everyone bundled up and not making eye contact with each other that ad would do a lot better using thailand for example
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,noted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,describe what being nonmonogamous my own behavior when it comes to sex and flirting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,make sure to highlight it while youre at it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah precisely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not that important
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would describe being nonmonogamous as being open to having more than one sexual andor romantic relationship at the same time as for myself when it comes down to flirting and sex i will flirt a bit with people i find attractive to test the waters if there is no interest or if it makes them uncomfortable i stop doing that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would do nothing to actively regulate the smp but i would remove various incentives and disincentives from it keep nofault divorce but the party initiating has no presumption of child custody in fact the opposite presumption to nondivorcing spouse gets no money but the split of joint legally titled property no alimony or court ordered child support no community property fault would have to be established for the full division of marital assets custody and support etc to kick in no court ordered or enforced child support from never wed fathers with a return of constructive commonlaw marriage for cohabiting couples with kids cohabiting with the mother of your paternity tested children marriage for the purposes of child support see for caveats though no state assistance for neverwed mothers or their children of any kind return to the model of hardship cases widows and the abandoned wife no government mandated affirmative action or quotas for women in any field of employ or education but no overt discrimination allowed in government employschools no government funding of anything to do with abortion or birth control nor any government regulation of such all of these things would serve to incentivize women to behave in a more circumspect manner with regard to men and would alter mens hand in the smp and mmp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id get rid of welfare everyone is free to do as they like with the body they have but then they must face the consequences of those choices men always face the consequences of their choices women never seem to face the full force of those consequences because ultimately someone is going to bail them out either a beta provider a sugar daddy or the state op what you an archwinger said about the traditional smp is another way to say sexual socialism you parcel out men and women evenly on the other hand full deregulation of the smp is sexual anarchy both are viable strategies but you cant have half of one and half of another without problems you cant have sexual anarchy when people make good choices but then sexual socialism when they make bad choices its either one or the other if a woman is entitled to do what she pleases with her body if she is a totally and completely autonomus individual then the negative consequences of her actions stds unwanted pregnancy etc are all burdens for her and her alone to bare and if she cant take them then tough shit but if the consequences are too dire if we as a group must support her then we as a group also have the justification to dictate what she does to prevent further cost to us in essence we do get to tell her who to fuck its the classic libertariansocialism dilemma everyone wants to have their cake but nobody wants diabetes mutual aid is better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a few ideas make condoms contraceptives plan b and abortion all freely available to every postpubescent woman this would be paid for through our current healthcare system and current pregnancyspecific organizations eg planned parenthood unless a woman is a married or b can show that a man made a legal commitment to care for her children she gets no form of child support payments from him because of she has complete control over when and by whom she gets pregnant in any case where a claim of child support might be made paternity testing is mandatory at the time of birth marriage and state assistance for neverwed mothers follow the form of by uatlasbshruggin increase fundingstaffing of child protective services so that when some women inevitably have kids and are unable to care for them those children arent stuck growing up hungry legalize prostitution the underlying ideas are to give women complete control over their reproduction give men complete control over their parental obligations reduce the number of unwanted children essentially people would only be stuck with obligations they sign up for
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is no hope for lots of men out there tbh its a dog eat dog hardball world and nothing will change it all id do is get rid of the bullshit enabling women to make ridiculous choices at menssocietys expense id change divorce laws to not favor the lower earner or result in any payouts enact default shared custody and end default mandatory child support seriously adjust welfare to at least limit the amount of kids on it and possibly require sterilization to receive it id make free abortion and birth control country wide so no one has to be a parent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so my question to red pill is this if you were to regulate the smp in some way what would that look like its it even possible without loss of individual freedoms or coercion honestly im not sure if it is rp has always said that the sexual strategies of men and women are fundamentally at odds with each other this means that for one to succeed and maximize its full potential the other side has to pay the price for it how do you create an smp where everyone has a reasonable chance to hookup without infringing on peoples right to choose their partners its a tricky situation and i dont see a solution that works out for both sides
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,free market if your product dont sell whose problem is it the smp works fine enough that our society isnt violent its worse for men in general when polygamist males run the joint those guys will cut of your balls and make you babysit their harem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,without marriage and readily available sex how are we supposed to motivate the legions of males deemed unsexy to work more than the bare minimum the economic oppurtunities women for financial independence are privileges paid by the surplus created by men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,low smv guys are about of the male population given womens selectivity women are programmed to be sexually interested in the top of the smv pyramid a constrictive type of pyramid not in the center or in the base society corrects this natural female predisposition giving to a larger number of men the possibility of a relationship but we are slowly reverting to a natural state of things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,at this point the only thing i see that could balance the market is non gender based laws effecting marriage alimony unfair child support custody hearings so on so forth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im torn i do well in the open smp i really like it because i can have a rotation of women and that feels great on the other hand it doesnt seem like this is the best model for society in the long term i wonder if some other societal model marriage will beat us out even though that wont happen in my lifetime i still care about the future generations of americans i want them to enjoy the same success i grew up with ultimately i dont have the answers here its a tough question and none of us can see the future
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,regulate and freedom oppose each other eta it is trp which states that men and women have different and opposing sexual strategies and one must fail for the other to succeed if that is the case then fuck all regulation id rather all these men fail than i compromise on my strategy and lose power and freedom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the smp doesnt need regulation it would naturally regulate itself if we remove forced financial transactions aka theft which uses government to steal money from men and hand it over to women take away the completely unnatural things like welfare child support alimony etc and women will have to earn their own cash or barter with their pussies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i realize these guys are frustrated and i believe that frustration leads to a lot of the sexism and misogyny that we blue pill folks oppose so nonfrustrated old school sexism and misogyny from when rpers want to roll it back to is ok
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wouldnt change anything im a restless and selfish person i like being able to drop everything at the bottom of a hat and do stuff i want im and i dont see a wife and kids in my future for that reasonso for me the current smp suites me in that i can have casual sex or shirt to medium term relationships if i want to im not pressed into marrying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,legalize prostitution get rid of marriage fix the family laws so men are not at a disadvantage in short let people find a way to fuck and have a fair and balanced system to deal with the consequences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i actually have no idea what you mean by regulate i think the smp is fine i have no problem with reality what pisses me off is that we have feminists actively lying to us about the smp women are just the same as men uh huh so we have skin i could drag you through the deluge of quotes i could recite verbatim from my past that got me into the worst situations a man can ever do to himself all because of misinformation trpers dont stay mad at women unless they wish the lie was real thats where you get into trouble accepting that feminists are a toxic marxist bullshit cesspool of misandry is how you separate who deserves hate and who deserves your time and attention from thereon after
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont really care about the smp i just do me and thats that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,religious doctrines provided a framework no sex outside marriage and divorce was frowned upon as an atheist i believe all religions are created by man but their foundations are informed by cultural experience throughout history based on what works ultimately no one is really free women have just traded dependence on men for employers and corporations there are no easy solutions but banning abortion is a good start all colleges should be required to admit males the reverse of today with about females we also need a basic income to reduce female demand for work so being a housewife is more desirable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,truthfully back marriage rid of cs and entitlements if she works if she doesnt she gets a one time payment based on income and how long they were together back the shaming of casual sex back feminism and civil rights shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think one thing that would help a lot without taking away big freedoms is removing and shutting down any forprofit or intercollegiate college sports programs schools used these as money making schemes that the students enrolled in the college never really see there are lots of universities that act like entertainment companies and upgrade their sports facilities but not classrooms or academicsthis is bad for everyone not just men as a whole these programs give the men in them a near impossible to compete with advanatage your bringing natural alphas or chads your letting them slip by with little to no academic effort they can even fail multiple classes miss exams and have tons of time to workout show off their skills and gain popularity during games then hit the parties and be the center of attention from women on another hand most of the high profile rape or sexual assault cases involve athletes their actions prompt feminists to create more sexual assault campaigns and more consent classes for all men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,regulation will simply lead back to traditional marriage over time it would be great for the society but it would imply coercion and be incompatible with individual rights alpha seeking self destructive behavior of women is genetic you just have to give it a lot of time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where the fuck in the red pill do circle jerk mental masturbation questions belong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think this can ever be implemented in a useful way but if you force women to only socially interact with men theyre not attracted to most womens attraction mechanism would recalibrate itself and theyd find the top of the new group attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,repeal all womens suffrage and ban the employment of women after a few decades of that women should understand their place again and we wont have a problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the reason why no fault divorce exists is because its super hard to prove abuse or cheating sometimes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how libertarian i like it what are these hardship cases you refer to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,pretty much what i was going to say in a long messy paragraph
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,enforced child support from never wed fathers or mothers right i mean while overlooked a growing proportion of child support is now paid by women does seem a bit mean i can just up and leave him with a kid no house no money and totally destitute but eh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,would this drive more divorcing spouses to find fault and what would your policy on that be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its in everyones best interest for women to be able to get abortions in case of rape or medical emergencies i have no problem paying for it with my taxes on the other hand women who need to get abortions because they are irresponsible should have their insurance payments go through the roof
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,court ordered or enforced child support from never wed fathers seems to me that would also have to include no court ordered or enforced visitation for never wed fathers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is the difference between regulation and incentive its still centralized control
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,love all of these
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if she is a totally and completely autonomus individual then the negative consequences of her actions stds unwanted pregnancy etc are all burdens for her and her alone to bare person doesnt make a baby or an std
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,liberty and justice for alltrue equality where do they sign
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fuck the pensioners disabled unemployed unemployable and orphaned amirite
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,id get rid of welfare absolutely feminism hasnt enabled women to become independent theyve just exchanged the man in the house with the man the welfare state is now mostly a middle man between provider men and the women taking ressources from men and giving them to women a lousy deal for the men of course in the old system at least there was some reciprocity the new deal is just a one way street
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so much this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men create plenty of negative externalities by doing what they want with their bodies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see how women get bailed out of anything more than men do its pretty equal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have no idea of the consequences of what youre advocating in this society populated by the generation thats growing up now who cant even spell the word responsibility you have no idea of the chaos that would ensue the reason society was more ordered in the past was because people believed in obligation selfsacrifice etc people do not believe in that any more people just do what the fuck they want the social consequences of this would be enormous particularly in the states europe is more stable and cultured in america it would be fucking chaos it would be bad enough in europe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree with a lot of this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the old fashioned model of marriage no longer exists in a lot of modern countries anymore because its a system that doesnt work and therefore got replaced by something that works better than it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is niceguy in the true sense of the word not the lowsmv groveling type there is no true sense of the word niceguy is predominantly used to describe men who are too nice dont express sexual intentions arent confident and are unsuccessful with women google nice guys with women and you are met with pages and pages of why girls dont like nice guys articles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,none of that will help low smv men get laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah it works for me too i get to do pretty much what i want dont work too much and i have a string of increasingly relatively younger gfs and when i want kids i settle down a bit with one of them if it doesnt work out no biggie we just part ways without much societal condemnation older women dont register on my radar and i stopped paying tax a long time ago so its not like i personally help to fund the male female wealth transfer as far as i can see women as a group are the biggest losers in the new order of things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men in the anglosphere did not have absolute control of women they had the legally recognized and enforced headship of their marital household and members single women were very free if they didnt mind social stigma
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,strawman men never had absolute control over women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i kind of feel like this is the actual default position of red pill but many of its members seem shy about admitting it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i could drag you through the deluge of quotes i could recite verbatim from my past that got me into the worst situations a man can ever do to himself all because of misinformation personal problem not a societal one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would increasing the number of males help when you have more men then women the competition becomes much fiercer even outside of college look at places like san jose，they are the worst place to meet women because there is so few of them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think we should just hunt down chads and send them to concentration camps set up in gary indiana lol s
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also make chemical castration for incel high risk men and sexual offenders a commonly prescribed treatment ask alan turing about his thoughts on this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,itt op is trying to bait rp into spewing misogyny most rp realized that while traditionalism is regulating smp they cant unopen the can or worms and take back womens rights rp is sexual strategy trying to cope with todays society ill even argue that rp wants unregulated smp for one thing they wont be forced to pay alimony andor child support since unregulated smp means women are not longer looking for provider as op stated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women no longer need to marry out of economic necessity so simply being a provider is no longer enough in the smp if that is all you bring to the table these guys are the losers in an unregulated free sexual market place and there is no safety net for them those guys are among the losers in an unregulated free smp women lose too they fuck hot guys until they cant anymore then wind up in marriages to sad sack beta losers whom they frivorce they then try a return to the carousel those women arent happy then there are women who dont marry because they wont settle but cant get a sufficiently high value man to marry them they lose out too uguitarsaregettingold had a post a while back talking about women being unhappy with dating they want ltrs but they hate the process of getting there the dating process dating men they lose out too it seems or at least theyre not happy about it there is no end to the whining and complaining by women about where are all the good men and never settle and why wont the hawt guys marry me and on and on these women can get hawt guys to fuck them all day long but cant get any of them to wife them up which is what most of these women claim to want the only real winners here are top alpha attractive men and women who arent all that interested in marriage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only ideas i ever see for smp regulation are reverting back to no fault divorce and ending child supportprograms for single mothers oh i think ive also seen limiting access to birth control so sort of exactly where it was before
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i wouldnt presume myself wise enough to know how to regulate human sexual behavior in masse but i do think some sort of standardized education on what each gender generally finds attractive could be useful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe its just me but heres the part uskinnysweaty should have paid attention to archwinger once financial dependency and social restrictions were removed from women were able to see what feminine nature is really like most women are hedonistic sluts who want to fuck hot fun guys that is the key takeaway from archs post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol right wing trps who preach pull yourselves up by your bootstraps laissez faire and government shouldnt even exist now want to regulate anything that doesnt work in their favor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see the problem with lv lowvalue men and women they either pair up and make babies or they can die out whats the big deal here seemingly whats said here is the lv men will die out but the women can support themselves but they wont be reproducing unless they stay at their market value medium and certainly high value men the majority of them arent going to start having kids on the side with these low quality women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no way to regulate the sexual marketplace without some kind of tyranny the cats been let of the bag you cant reverse personal freedom and knowledge almost all of the suggestions here hark back to a religious time which is never going to come back the only slight tangential change id make would be to have mandatory paternity tests for all births and especially for any child support claims
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this was tagged please repost under the automod
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great idea
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you wouldnt have to prove it id give it a clear and convincing evidence standard youd have to convince a judge or jury not prove anything also sometimes thats life no fault divorce should not lead to the same asset distribution as fault based divorce it is not equitable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,er visits or a signoff from a social worker would do also the pi business would be booming the more i think about it this benefits women in many more ways than men in an adultery situation the other man is much less likely to come forward than the other woman the other woman is usually led to believe she has skin in the game shes an ally in this scenario the types of abuse women are likely to perpetrate covert emotional abuses are much more difficult to prove
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just because something is difficult to prove doesnt mean it should be assumed true by default that tosses out the whole point of having a judicial system
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,widows and abandoned wives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who asked you im not interested in your opinion of me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont personalize issues on this sub further issuesviolations may result in a tempban
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the interest of justice this is a very hard concept for the selfish nature of women to grasp if i wants it i deserves it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if the man and woman cohabited and she had a baby it would be a common law marriage in my scheme and she would pay support for abandoning this is addressed in my points by neverwed i mean also never cohabited a neverwed father would have to fight for and win custody to get support since in my scheme unwed fathers have no rights or responsibilities he would be unable to do this so there would be no possibility of court ordered child support from a woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they would have to show it to a judge andor jury in court fault would be the traditional divorce grounds cruelty abandonment adultery mental illness loss of consortium etc no system is perfect and i dont expect any to be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats nice that you dont have a problem with the government paying for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes no responsibilities no rights no such thing as involuntary unwed father bastards belong to the mother and her family
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in none of these cases are women being regulated women would be free to divorce have promiscuous sex work have out of wedlock children my proposals deregulate who pays for womens freedom and the consequences of their decisions they regulate no behaviors at all did you read anything i wrote
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how does this change anything about udaveofmars comment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but if you dont know the name of the other person however heres the thing you cant force a man to take care of a child against his will unless you use some kind of force to compel him most likely the state once you start using the state to enforce sexual rules then youre once again back to sexual socialism as soon as you use the power of the state you use the power of every one of us and once i am involved then i get to have a say on both of them man and woman and if i have a say over women then i have a say over her sexuality does this sound like a fair situation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure thats exactly what i said
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lousy deal for the men of course in the old system at least there was some reciprocity the new deal is just a one way street you dont think women contribute in some way by i dunno giving birth to the entire population of the world thats time they dont get paid for in your ass backwards usa
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men bear and pay for the consequences when they do things that create said negatives women by and large dont they usually find someone to blame or get a man to pay for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men and women in any event the user you responded to was advocating for a system in which individuals take greater responsibility for their actions a movement towards that would limit actions with negative externalities by punishing bad behavior relative to our current system
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah and they go to jail in huge numbers in the usa and also die
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i suggest you look at the discrepancy between welfare going to women and welfare going to men or the gap between women having tons of reproductive rights and men having next to zero it is far far from equal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i also value obligation selfsacrifice etc i wouldnt mind a society that values those things too so i do agree with you if i had the choice between sexual socialism and sexual anarchy id probably pick sexual socialism but if i had the choice between sexual anarchy and this hybrid system then id choose anarchy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think youre romanticizing the past a lot sure modern people still suck but from where im standing older generations and not just the baby boomers seem much more shortsighted and irresponsible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is the same tired argument pushed by people who seek to control others bad things will happen if you dont let us control you the polar ice caps will melt and well all be living underwater by if we dont stop people using so much energy claim the lying piece of shit politicians who fly around in their private jets all year long but you the people must cut down your carbon emissions if britain leaves the eu well all be doomed the economy will crash and therell be no jobs for anyone if trump gets elected therell be a third world war its all a pile of shit and its only leading to slavery were heading for a dystopia like the ones that orwell and huxley wrote about the masses will be ruled by a bunch of scientists who think theyre gods and people will learn to love their slavery and hate the idea of freedom and anyone who desires it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,europe is more stable and cultured not with the influx of rapefugees currently flooding the continent and with the growing muslim contingent in the uk
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe so maybe not the time frame requires to make that determination is longer than our lives just because it wins out short term doesnt mean it will win out long term i hope youre right tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mens value in general would increase if women werent given state sponsored resources
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,anyone is free to do what they want
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are misunderstanding what a strawman is in the context of a debate i will give you an example ulewiscross you must really hate men and think they are weak by saying that they never had absolute control what a misandrist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre not going to get anyone to talk about this with you because then theyll subject themselves to your name calling and abuse so i dont blame reds for taking a pass on this one you wont give them a fair shake or hear them out in good faith youll just call them sexists and losers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like most men they love women and want to keep them safe absolute patriarchal control keeps women safe feminism dissolved a lot of this control
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so are single mothers maybe they should pick their partners better as the feminists tell men who want to get paternity tests or maybe they should refrain from being sluts as the feminists tell men who are frustrated by child support
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except they came from fucking public school teachers and professors kind of a public problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats the question isnt it you can argue that societal regulation is exclusively a legal matter or you can also take cultural aspects into account
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men will make more money and thus raise median male smv the available women will remain the same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you cant eliminate chads because chads are always relative you eliminate the best and the next best will get the limelight what you can do is remove scenarios that benefit chads the most and give them unfair advantages
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we already do this to sex offenders im talking about something not mutilating or permanent im saying men who have no sexual prospects would choose this especially with the right propaganda
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes this exactly heres what will happen someone will list out what regulationsactions should be taken or how the smp will be changed blues will swoop in with sexist racist insecure personal problem not a societal problem misogyny assholes you want to go back to the back alley abortions women married to unattractive men women are property of men women owned by men bad bad bad and no good faith discussions will be had
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,op is trying to bait rp into spewing misogyny im asking for honest opinions if you dont have one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most of my friends are married about percent are in happy marriages percent in unhappy marriages they all married young i think we hear a lot of the complaints out there because they have the loudest voices happy people dont complain they just get on with their lives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is limiting access to birth control taxpayers not being on the hook for the bill if so then yes i am for limiting access to birth control go buy your own men are expected to women are equals right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,child support is good except it needs to be treated as a civil issue instead of a legal one similar to student loans
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i responded to to that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then once the top of women pair off with top of men you repeat the process and force the bottom to only interact with each other women still get their hypergamy fix and betasomegas get to actually fuck women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no fault divorce should not lead to the same asset distribution as fault based divorce i agree no fault divorce should be in general assuming equal contribution to the marriage fault based divorce should be adjusted based on what the fault is if the fault is something really bad like abuse then it should be or the person at fault taking the or in addition if the abuse can be proved it should go to criminal court as well if its not that bad for example one time cheating then maybe again faulty party takes less
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well you are expressing a point of view in a debate forum people will challenge it its kind of you know the whole point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not at all a personal issue perfectly in line with everything we are discussing here aka why some women behave in an antiwoman way regarding the regulations of the sexual market they want to see employed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i kind of like all of this except for birth control family planning is not a huge proportion of medically billed expenses if were saving medicaidmedicare money id go with making all people over a certain age on medicare required to write a living will when they are of sound mind i think most people would not choose to be resuscitated intubated etc and thats the shit that costs a ton of money keeping old people on their last leg every few months for the final years of their life catholics in particular have a hypocritcal stance on this sort of thing even with birth control being widely accepted i think birth control allows women to exercise some modicum of their imperative more than ever without the rest of us footing the bill woman who need planned parenthood to get care are either young or broke getting rid of it perpetuates the dysgenic cycle however if women need to be more circumspect with their marriage choices and they cant leave frivolously or without proving adultery it actualizes civilizes their choice in men and this civilizes men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,never wed biodadsperm donor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why dont men get consequences under these proposals then what im reading from these proposals is that men get no responsibility or consequences it takes people to get a woman pregnant but under your suggestions only person is dealing with the consequences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course i read it my question is who gets to come up with the incentives because whoever gets the power to create those incentives is shaping society with a heavy hand that is why i asked you what you thought they difference was between regulation and incentives either way you are rewarding people for acting the way you want and punishing them for stepping out of bounds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not fair to give the woman full responsibility and the man none his proposed system does that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you cant force a man to take care of a child against his will unless you use some kind of force to compel him most likely the state once you start using the state to enforce sexual rules then youre once again back to sexual socialism this is the fallacy here this is like saying lets make a new law where big businesses who dump chemicals into lakes actually get punished for it whoa man thats communism no its not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you said to get rid of welfare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men pay the majority of taxes while women receive the majority of taxfinanced welfare feminism supports high taxes which disproportionally affect men increasing welfare for women child support alimony and general big state policies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know the numbers for the usa but i assume in the same direction in denmark in the welfare state women as a group is a net deficit and men as a group a net profit each women cost on average over her lifetime and each man benefits with on average over his lifetime women are more costly through such things as greater educational investments more costly than mens education maternity leave time off for sick children child care institutions etc and benefits less through smaller salary fewer work years etc as far as i know most of those things on the cost side are core feminists agendas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im from ass backwards denmark and yes one of the major things women do is give birth and raise children before husbands would pay his wife for these things through shared household today the welfare state pays women for this and men pay the state but if you pay through the middleman you are of course robbed of leverage maybe the kids arent even his maybe he has no kids etc still has to pay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wait are you suggesting that women by and large dont suffer consequences from an unwanted pregnancy thats fucking insane dude can you explain why you think this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,raising a child costs n time sounds like consequences much more severe consequences than men face to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,huge numbers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men and women have equal reproductive rights i dont really know what you mean but i think there are very good reasons that women can receive more welfare on average none of them are just that theyre taking advantage at least not more than men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but we dont have a society and population that values those things therein lies the problem thats why there is no turning back i always say that im an anarchist or borderline anarchist in principle but spending time around people and talking to peoplei just cannot advocate anarchism because it cant work with the existing population both a sexually conservative or as you put it socialistic and anarchistic perspective require discipline an informed population putting the needs of others above ones own desires etc i dont see any prospect of that occurring if we implemented what you are advocating then there would be children starving all over the place i would like to think people wouldnt let this happen but in this society i cant see any other outcome
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most people simply follow the prevailing values of the time that they live in it just so happens that the social values have changed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont disagree with anything that youve said apart from that im not a trump supporter but if you change absolutely nothing about the existing society other than pulling welfare then complete chaos will ensue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,demographics is destiny
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,throw those bitches in the gutter kids too fuck them all trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok instead of getting hung up on whether logical fallacies are correctly identified what do you think of my assertion that men never had absolute control over women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plenty of women starved to death back in the day and lived in extraordinarily awful conditions just because men had an expected role didnt mean they were any good at it modern society is orders of magnitude better at keeping women safe
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,safe slaves were kept safe too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like most men they love women and want to keep them safe absolute patriarchal control keeps women safe this is completely naive thinking that isnt reflected by reality at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you and your single mothers rant mothers are single mothers because of deadbeat fathers why dont you go after those fools who abandoned their children
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah blues will say that doesnt matter not anyone elses fault that you believed everyone elses lies never mind that you were young and impressionable never mind that you had no frame of reference to judge whether what you were being told was true or not never mind all that its all your problem your fault your issue your fuckup
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,about the smprelationships with women im curious what you were told by public school teachers and profs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and everyone else in that public school setting figured it the fuck out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,making money does not affect smv in america unless you have status combined with it look at how software engineers are doing with women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if its a free choice by a consenting adult hey castrate away
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,notice that my post is under the automod im not directly respond to you im warning people about your troll attempt im asking for honest opinions if you dont have one dont kid yourself this is obvious baiting and this thread should have been reported in the first place
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think youre overestimating the percentage of happy marriages but yeah the complainers are the loudest ones and everyone pays attention to them there sure seems to be many of those complainers though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a lot of insurance companies dont even cover birth control but they will cover viagra hmm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,idk what they meant by it but most women get birth control through insurance they still pay for medicaid covers medications which are more prescribed to men too and birth control is a pretty necessary and cheap medication so i dont see why it shouldnt be covered as a necessary medical expense anymore than i would argue prostate exams or pap smears shouldnt be covered because only one gender can benefit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,civil issues are legal issues im not sure what you mean by this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where what wasis your response
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love it why isnt this instituted everywhere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you didnt challenge any of my statements you made personal comments like always if youd like to argue abotu my propoasals id be happy to discuss them with you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,high value women dont have to rely on socialist concepts to support themselves conservatism isnt antiwomen unless the woman is lazy irresponsible andor generally expect for other people to support their lifestyle edit i can pay for my own housing food birth control and abortion if it was ever necessary i dont need the government to do it for me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a couple things it is in fact personal because it clearly references the commentercomment above you its obviously directed at her it may also be directed at other women but the context of the comment matters theres issue with other rules in addition to the above it seems to treat the parent commentcommenter as sort of an object rather than someone youre trying to engage in dialogue thats not the kind of content we want here on ppd maybe try editing it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if women can raise a kabillion for the susan g komen foundation and breast cancer why cant they all fund their own abortion and bc clinics im not married to the no funding for bc services id rather have the funding be on the most micro county level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do only women divorce no fault did you read the part when cohabiting imbues men with legal marital responsibilty unmarried women have th eunilateral option of abortion and adoption therefore in my view unmarrie dwomen are responsible for any children both conceived and brought to term outside of marriage all the choices all the rights all the responsibility the unilateraly chocie to abort short circuits the male role in creating a baby imo and limits it solely to conception i have no problem with neve rmarried men having zero say in the birth of the womans child but he also gets zero responsibility marriage is the means by which men take responsibilty for a womans children
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,either way you are rewarding people for acting the way you want and punishing them for stepping out of bounds personal problem not a societal problem and at any rate thats no different from the incentive system now in place which uses the stick and the carrot on men right now there are incentives to get people men to act the way we want and punish men for stepping out of bounds
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i didnt mean incentive that way my steps will incentivize much are responsible female sexual behavior by default im not talking about rewarding people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes the one with unilateral choice to carry a pregnancy to term so she can have unilateral responsibility too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,realistically the male would give his answer within a certain time frame so that the woman knows whether or not abortion would be the best choice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,with power comes responsibility women have all the power in terms of deciding who gets to have children and sex and who doesnt therefore they should take all responsibility
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my point is that its contradictory to say im a free individual who can do whatever they want with their body and also say i fucked up now you have to help me either people are responsible for their own actions and deserve their consequences or not the op asked how i would improve the sexual marketplace and i think what would help would be to pick one or the other either is going to work better than what we currently have which is im responsible for all the good that happens to me and others are responsible for the bad this doesnt happen in every single case of course but i believe the sexual marketplace works better when conveying consistent information it can go either way either we regulate or we dont but at least when things are consistent people can rationally plan the expected outcome of their actions people screw up when their expectations dont meet reality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lets make a new law where big businesses who dump chemicals into lakes actually get punished for it if making babies is like dumping chemicals into lakes we should sterilize everybody and let the human species go extinct
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,with an asterisk
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,isnt that welfare because of men too most women arent on government assistance the ones who are are typically poor single parents where the majority of the aid goes toward assisting the child ultimately im paying for the consequence of two peoples decision a man and a woman who had unprotected sex and dont have the means or care to provide for the offspring wholly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres no welfare for women theres welfare for single parents n their children not to give women freebies but to not end up with child beggars n prostitutes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually income tax is a small proportion of all tax paid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shouldnt any burden a woman bears for the child be associated to both of the people who conceived the child or are women suddenly splicing their genes and fertilizing their own eggs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre from denmark would you prefer to have to be the sole support of your stayathome wife rather than her getting maternity leave really youd want a woman who might marry you just because you have money whie shed fuck some other guy behind your back because those were the good old days women have always had needs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they do suffer consequences but its not enough to deter them because they keep doing it in growing numbers the state gives them welfare and forces men to pay a huge portion of their income to women without these things they would have many more abortions or possibly become more selective with their sexual choices or select for different criteria
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,money and time tha men pay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,usa has the world record for first world incarceration rates
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill tell you what i told lollygagyo so the common argument from mras goes something like this both people did the deed so both people are responsible however only she can take the morning after pill only she can get an abortion only she can leave it at a fire stationhospital in case she doesnt want it and in a few states only she can give it up for adoption without the partners consent obviously the woman carries the fetus within her so reproductive rights are reasonably skewed in her favor however she has multiple avenues to completely give up the child no questions asked with no penalty a man has zero options to do the same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i always say that im an anarchist or borderline anarchist in principle but spending time around people and talking to peoplei just cannot advocate anarchism because it cant work with the existing population man im right there with you i went through my anarchist phase out of college but after meeting more people and seeing more of the world i feel the way you do sexual anarchy is definitely not my primary choice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,society can increase dependence on men without adverse consequence
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you arent an anarchist you dont even know what anarchism means
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure i understand your point and its relevance to what i said
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think your assertion is false there are still countries in the world where men have control over women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,marriage slavery rthathappened
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,depending on the environment thats not a bad trade off all the time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,correct
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mmm divorce rate doesnt suggest that in any case i really have no little sympathy for either though your deadbeat dads are for the most part men who were unable to pay their child support and were sent to prison so you know theres that but im sure thats a statistic that doesnt make its way around in feminist circles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,part is relevant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mothers are single mothers because of deadbeat fathers single mothers are single because they didnt choose their partner right and chose to forego abortion and adoption they made three mistakes one after another they deserve no sympathy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,everyone else went through the same public schools and teachers they figured it out it is your personal problem everyone else in society managed to find their way forward
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a solid distillation of the marxist mentality they harbor well said ive met the same resistance on other topics without being able to articulate it like that but youre spot on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,health class circa i asked my health teacher why she didnt mention that men have fewer ribs than women and what the reality was she said no men and women have the same number of ribs she could have left it at that but she said the only difference between men and women is their reproductive organs i would later learn that children are only susceptible to new ideas that conflict with old ones when subjects are properly convinced they were lied to in the first place religious conservative children are easy pickings for feminists my feminist professors would make more measured statements akin to secondwave feminism but feminism all the same i wouldnt fight them on their specifics but i couldnt help but point out obvious differences to which they would gently concede only the smallest generalizations the coaxing in undergraduate studies is quite insidious because they know they could come off the wrong way to honest intellectual inquiry it was a method that carefully preserved the misinformation i had gotten growing up and the conservative values that women deserved to be treated at least better than you treated yourself never hit a woman implied subtext because theyre fragile and benevolent creatures who would never take advantage of this double standard i ate that shit up i held doors dreamed in pastels and expected marriage was some kind of guaranteed amicable relationship that only went south if both parties talked it out and agreed jesus how fucking awfully wrong how miserably wrong how how is this not child abuse i mean honestly then to have people come at you and say ohoh you didnt know that bruh its so obvious you dumb you duuuumb get your head checked women are as bad as men and no one would ever tell you that as a kid thank god for all the teen boys who get a taste of the red pill before its too late
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,very brave of you your warning is having a significant effect it seems
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think youre right some of those happy ones might be putting up a front
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can provide surveys n studies n anecdotes for days about how most ppl arent miserable most marriages arent miserable n all this misery hes going on about isnt the reality for most ppl n he just carries on with the same narrative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never said there are no happy women just the opposite probably of marriages have happy women probably of single women are happy being single stop lying about what i say
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is completely false and has been completely false since well before the passage of the affordable care act the hubbub over the contraceptives mandate which i note you ignore only applies to women was manufactured bullshit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,meaning that if a guy doesnt pay he shouldnt be sent to jail or prison or get a criminal charge but his wages might be garnished after a certain point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because of the voting power of the women are wonderful effect laden men and women if this was implemented right now by a dictatorship at first women would be outraged but as soon as they realized theres nothing they can do to change it and they actually start being attracted to previously unattractive men theyd gradually grow happy theres a reason why arranged marriages are less happy than love marriages for the first years but after that they become more happy and those levels keep rising even more over the years while love marriage happiness levels become abysmal on average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because it stalls evolution
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,great so lets edit my comment here why do conservative women have such antiwoman views that clearly go against the female imperative and favour men what you have written in that comment seems to me something that if indeed comes from the mouth of a woman would be a result of severe brainwashactual internalised misogyny how can conservative women and this obviously includes you genuinely seem to believe that their only way to get power is to bow to the male imperative because somehow metaphorically this is reminiscent of stockholm syndrome which is all about bowing to your oppressor so how can a whole group of women which are given an alternative by society believe that propagating these views is in their interest
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but there are women who cannot pay for abortions because they are from poor backgrounds and that is not even the main issue you are disadvantaged in a world which served the male imperative aka in which women as a collective are fearful of pregnancy and do not have protection against bosses who harass them in the workplace you are literally weakening your own power within society just to lash out at a few women also high value women in this context is something i found pitiful what it literally means is i allowed men to make me follow their imperative by adopting the belief that having less sex makes me high value meaning i have suddenly begun to care about ncount a male issue i genuinely feel so sorry for all the damaged women out there who have such delusional beliefs and do not realise how they are being led on and used
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,let me describe the ways the policies she listed can be antiwoman this is not a personal attack this is my statement on why i believe the policies dont work its hard to prove abusecheating in a court of law sometimes impossible women take the sole responsibility for unprotected sex even though it takes to tango same issue as while a lot of antifeminists say women can succeed just work hard they dont realize that for a woman to succeed in certain fields they have to work twice as hard as a man because they face a lot of often subtle discrimination the kind that is hard to prove in a court of law when she speaks she could be interrupted and when a man says the exact thing she said everyone else would congratulate him for making a great point for example cant really prove this in court as discrimination but it is just like point this puts all responsibility on the woman and none on man even though it takes to tango
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i will edit it to address her more directly but i disagree that the comment should not be personal if we also engage red pillers all the time regarding their personal views expressed in a comment as is done daily by myself and others without comment from the mods the same should apply for other groups of people or is there special preference for this particular user
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,county level will move resources away from those who need it and from the people most likely to make poor choices in the first place giving girls depo shots is really cheap in the scheme of things cheaper than regulating and cleaning up after the result anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,another thing to consider is that many of the men who actually do marry and forgo custody in divorce would be fine with agreeing to child support in some separate fashion most middle class men pay child support without issue the idea that it will be leveraged against them automatically without their choice to divorce in the first place is troubling for them in practice it isnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,money is not an infinite resource for most people youre basically saying women should choose which theyd rather have unwanted pregnancies or cancer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,did you read the part when cohabiting imbues men with legal marital responsibilty i wasnt talking about cohabiting im talking about boyfriends noncohabiting who decide to skip out once shes pregnant or ons guys unmarried women have th eunilateral option of abortion and adoption therefore in my view unmarrie dwomen are responsible for any children both conceived and brought to term outside of marriage all the choices all the rights all the responsibility under your suggested system men have all the choices and all the rights they can choose to stay with the mother and marry her they can choose to stay involved with the babys life without any legal responsibility as long as they dont marrycohabitate with the mother they can choose to just run away and have responsibility the unilateraly chocie to abort since you dont support abortion bills being covered by the government not all women have the unilateral choice to abort not all women are rich or umc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,personal problem not a societal problem uh no i am talking about centrally controlled society that is the antithesis of personal problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,britain tried putting all the onus on women in the nineteenth century as i recall it increased bastardy because men were suddenly rewarded for not supporting their kids actual successful reductions in illegitimacy have always involved extreme social pressures on both parties look at colonial ma vs va
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,unless i am reading it wrong it seems you are heavily incentivizing marriage and staying married a thumbs up to marriage yes most of your punishments seem to involve deviating from that marriage model is that what you are aiming for here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,every redpiller makes the same argument and ive addressed it over and over again this will be my last time abortion is not a viable choice for everyone some women live in places where its illegal or even if its not illegal its very hard to get ie texas some women are religious some womens families will not let her get an abortion some women cant afford it some women just dont want one and thats her choice too the man cant expect that the woman will choose to get an abortion and therefore its partially his responsibility to protect himself for the outcome of a pregnancy by doing things like wearing a condom its his responsibility to do as much as he can do to prevent an unwanted pregnancy just like its hers theyre equal in it her baby has a right too this isnt a man vs woman thing this is about the fact that the baby deserves to have support from hisher father
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you both consent to potentially creating a baby when you have sex a woman isnt consenting to an abortion by default
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is pure black n white thinking most economies arent socialist or capitalist theyre mixed economies thats completely common n normal my point is that its contradictory to say im a free individual who can do whatever they want with their body and also say i fucked up now you have to help me no its really not can you regulate what ppl on gov healthcare eat or drink bc the state has to pay for their illnesses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you both fucked up though she spread her legs you dove in with your dick it takes two to procreate and you two probably didnt utilise protection as well as you could have so unwanted pregnancy both partners fault to some extent wrap it up boys and girls strangely so many men who are like omg no child support no are also all like no condoms no its weird just stop fucking around unprotected this is not hard
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my point is that its contradictory to say im a free individual who can do whatever they want with their body and also say i fucked up now you have to help me i fucked up now i can just run away with no consequences whatsoever thats what your system is going to advocate for men meanwhile child support is saying we fucked up so now we both have to deal with it and thats more fair
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,saying that child support is a form of sexual socialism is just as ridiculous as saying punishing big businesses for dumping chemicals into lakes is a form of communism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you didnt put any disclaimers at the bottom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but to not end up with child beggars n prostitutes by giving women freebies child poverty fucking sucks but its still true that the state is essentially assuming the financial risk for womens sexual choices at the same time mens sexual choices are not given the same protection
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how many single parents are women and how many single parents are men if congress passed a law banning any restaurant that sells tacos theres no such thing as a mexican restaurant ban right its just a tacoselling ban
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shouldnt any burden a woman bears for the child be associated to both of the people who conceived the child not if its a single mother no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,from denmark yes and i opted out and havent paid taxes in many years because the welfare state is an obscene beast of ever growing proportions im not sentimental about old days the past is a different country to which theres no going back i do prefer to be the sole support of my stayathome wife rather than getting maternity leave and in fact that is what i do right now at this time its of course not going to be any more expensive just because you dont pay the middleman its not like paying through taxes and adding a layer or many layers of bureaucracy magically makes it cheaper
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he could choose not to marry and not to pay now you must pay no matter what you choose
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same for men you would think that would deter men from busting raw in women who arent their wives but nope
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they do suffer consequences but its not enough to deter them because they keep doing it in growing numbers same can be said for men in reality some ppl arent v good at longterm planning or thinking theres plenty of illegitimacy in world countries where its a oneway ticket to prostitution n begging you cant tell me those women arent suffering consequences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,regardless its ridiculous to say that women dont suffer the consequences of unwanted pregnancy raising an unwanted child is a pretty huge consequence that shouldnt be overlooked even with child support and welfare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what time costs do men pay at most men pay a small of their paycheck in cs many dont even do that the vast majority of childrearing costs falls on women its not even close
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,with a disproportionate rate of people of colour incarcerated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,definitely im not disagreeing particular with that just when people might suggest the woman is under some obligation to have an abortion i dont think shes any more or less responsible if she doesnt choose to part of that is because despite the ease with which people might propose it as an option its traumatic and life changing enough to have an abortion noone is happy to go through it the woman has essentially been pressed into a bad situation regardless
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am perfectly fine with other peoples children starving all over the place it is not my responsibility see this makes me incredibly glad that you and people who think like you dont run the world complete lack of humanity complete lack of empathy this kind of attitude leaves the entire world suffering and in pain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am perfectly fine with other peoples children starving all over the place it is not my responsibility you might find this has consequences that you dont like
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i do know what it means it refers to creating a society in which all existing institutions are dissolved and replaced with essentially a selfgoverned structure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont care about other countries smps i care about the uscanadian smp and here men dont have absolute control over women and never have
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,essentially end conventional marriage which was viewed primarily as a form of sexual slavery andor prostitution talk to uarchwinger please
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont agree with sending people to prison for lack of child support payments but some guys will do absolutely anything to avoid paying for the kids they brought in the world but im sure you conveniently forgot about that right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nice put all the blame on the woman i am not saying she is blameless far from it but where is your blame for the father also your hatred of single mothers calling them shedevils is clearly driven by your frustration that these women in their prime removed themselves from the smp it isnt economic otherwise your hatred should be aimed at all the obese people in america who chose not to lead healthy lives it is purely more sexual frustration and ranting people make bad choices it happens fine stay away from single mothers who cares i dont understand why rp is so hate filled against single mothers and btw i see several guys on these threads who ended up with single moms and have all sort of excuses as to why their particular single mom girlfriend deserves sympathy you cray
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,obesity is rampant because fat americans refuse to lead healthy lives we are forced to pay for their fat asses and all the diseases that come with them do you have any obese people in your family they deserve no sympathy same logic dude
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol i wont call typing on a keyboard behind an alias on the internet brave i do think you should get over yourself if you think anything thats being posted here has any effect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont personalize issues on ppd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really because there was a time not long ago when insurance companies covered penile implants erectile dysfunction drugs etcand i was stuck paying off retail for the pill every month
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah america is batshit insane treating it as criminal rather than civil what you described is how child support works in every other western country lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok i agree it shouldnt be criminal but its still a legal issue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fantastic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no it doesnt and even if it did big deal well all be dead by that time anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,none of that argues with any of my proposals and is just questioning my character which is all youre able to do when you address me for some reason does it occur to you i might not believe paying for women to have out of wedlock children and makign women into their own breadwinners actually serves the female imperative maybe i have an entirely different vision of what serves the female imperative than you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because feminism creates anarchy and demographic collapse everywhere its tried
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are disadvantaged in a world which served the male imperative i dont believe that i am disadvantaged as a female quite the opposite actually i can do just as well as my male peers i have never encountered sexism throughout my education in engineering no less or in the workplace unlike feminists i dont find myself looking for ways in which i am disadvantaged high value women in this context is something i found pitiful you assumed what i meant by high value all i meant was intelligent socially savvy motivated and attractive basically any woman who can make something of herself without needing the assistance of the government i genuinely feel so sorry for all the damaged women out there who have such delusional beliefs and do not realise how they are being led on and used now youre just being rude i am not damaged i am perfectly happy with my life i have a great relationship a good job parents that i can look up to i am not being used by anyone i believe in selfreliance and perseverance not social programs and dependencies edit i never said anything about ncount fyi i am not religious i am politically conservativelibertarian there is a difference
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,while a lot of antifeminists say women can succeed just work hard they dont realize that for a woman to succeed in certain fields they have to work twice as hard as a man because they face a lot of often subtle discrimination the kind that is hard to prove in a court of law when she speaks she could be interrupted and when a man says the exact thing she said everyone else would congratulate him for making a great point for example cant really prove this in court as discrimination but it is many rational people do not believe this because there is no evidence for it hard to prove in this case no evidence they just feel that way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women can succeed just work hard they dont realize that for a woman to succeed in certain fields they have to work twice as hard as a man because they face a lot of often subtle discrimination this is so wrong it is laughable are you in one of those certain fields because i am i studied chemical engineering and computer science i never faced discrimination when i was in school i have never felt discriminated against in my job even as an engineer in a majority male office space so why do feminists imagine that women like myself feel discriminated against i think its ridiculous i am not a victim i do not need feminism to help me succeed mostly though i do not look for things that someone might consider discrimination i am not trying to call out men for microagressions or ambiguous actions its silly and it devalues the meaning behind actual discrimination because i know that there are women who face real discrimination but your example when she speaks she could be interrupted is absolutely not discrimination that is part of life i am interrupted by males and females equally during meetings it is part of collaboration that doesnt make it discrimination if you feel that being interrupted is discrimination then you should not hold a job further you are explaining precisely why women used to be seen as incapable of being professionals because they obsessed over petty things i also go to the free weights section of the gym which is male as an impressionable freshman it used to make me feel uncomfortablelike all the guys were watching me because they probably were i was hot but i didnt scream sexism and force my university to have more females in the free weights room i just built up my own confidence in myself now i own it and so i want to laugh and also feel insulted when people insinuate that women in certain fields are routinely discriminated against
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you reporting the comments in question if not we wont see it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i agree im more concerned with court ordered and enforced cs than voluntary agreements i want the presumptions changed i think most men would still forego custody and pay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,centrally controlled society anathema
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uh yes youre talking about individual responses to societal circumstances personal problem we all have to deal with the society we find ourselves in some do that better than others personal problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there was no safe reliable birth control then the onus for unwed pregnancy is always on women imo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats why i think its incompatible with cutting access to birth control and abortion for proles
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what punishments did you see there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,consent to sex is not consent to parenthood period lps is designed for areas where abortion is legal and accessible that being said in areas without it women can still give it up for adoption or use safe haven laws they can opt out of parenthood he cant expect that she will abort but he should be able to expect that he will not be held financially responsible against his will if she decides not to abort the baby does not have a right to someone elses money not the father or the tax payer rights are to be free from things not happening to you not entitlements to others working for you ie free speech is the right to not have the government come after you its not the same as a right to people listening
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the man cant expect that the woman will choose to get an abortion and therefore its partially his responsibility to protect himself for the outcome of a pregnancy by doing things like wearing a condom its his responsibility to do as much as he can do to prevent an unwanted pregnancy just like its hers theyre equal in it thats the farthest thing from equal i can imagine basically what you are saying is that men consent to parenthood through sex but women dont
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the man cant expect that the woman will choose to get an abortion then theres no reason she should be able to expect him andor the state to finance her choices but as of right now she can
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,abortion is not a viable choice for everyone some women live in places where its illegal or even if its not illegal its very hard to get ie texas some women are religious some womens families will not let her get an abortion some women cant afford it some women just dont want one and thats her choice too yes it is a viable choice for everyone abortion is not illegal anywhere in the us roe and casey say no undue burdens on abortions in the first trimester the fact that an abortion is very hard to get does not mean its illegal or impossible to get one no one has an obligation to make it easy cheap or convenient for anyone to get an abortion women who have wanted abortions have gotten them even before roe the fact that some women are religious or dont want abortions is not the mans problem bullshit womens family wont let her get an abortion women have an absolute right to abortion in the first trimester and they dont have to get anyones consent not even a husbands consent for minors depends where you live many states allow exceptions to parental consent for abortion some dont as for money if she really wants an abortion she can get one the man cant expect that the woman will choose to get an abortion and therefore its partially his responsibility to protect himself for the outcome of a pregnancy by doing things like wearing a condom its his responsibility to do as much as he can do to prevent an unwanted pregnancy just like its hers theyre equal in it not if hes not married to her shes single it should be her problem her body her choice her consequences no theyre not equal in it because she and she alone can make the choice to abort or carry to term her baby has a right too this isnt a man vs woman thing this is about the fact that the baby deserves to have support from hisher father i find it funny that liberals who fought tooth and nail for women to have the right to murder their unborn children are now all up in arms over the babys rights really really a child whose mother isnt married to the childs biodadsperm donor doesnt have a right to support from said man mom should have thought of that before she spread her legs you shouldnt get to have it both ways no responsibilities at all until i get pregnant and then i have the sole power to decide whether your child lives or dies and the sole power to tether you to child support obligations for years and possibly beyond
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no its really not can you regulate what ppl on gov healthcare eat or drink bc the state has to pay for their illnesses sure you can ebt doesnt cover everything free health care doesnt cover everything it covers the necessities but thats getting beyond my point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so the common argument from mras goes something like this both people did the deed so both people are responsible however only she can take the morning after pill only she can get an abortion only she can leave it at a fire stationhospital in case she doesnt want it and in a few states only she can give it up for adoption without the partners consent obviously the woman carries the fetus within her so reproductive rights are reasonably skewed in her favor however she has multiple avenues to completely give up the child no questions asked a man has zero options to do the same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lets make a new law where big businesses who dump chemicals into lakes actually get punished for it more like i fucked up and you have to deal with it if you wont or cant the police will throw you in jail and ruin your life forever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah absolutely men can just walk away in sexual anarchy no questions asked because no one could stop them thats a pretty good deal for men but a pretty shit deal for women so then sexual anarchy is off the table for women which means all the justification for im a free individual who can do whatever they want with their body just doesnt fly anymore no it seems that there needs to be some kind of regulation which women say they dont want but appear to need if that regulation comes from the state then by extension it comes from me and so i have a say in the matter look all im really saying is that if women or anyone else for that matter want to be free let them be free if they want assistance lets assist but get rid of the double think
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is not having a choice in the matter fair for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,saying that child support is a form of sexual socialism yeah it isnt socialism its worse its financial slavery
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i said that mutual aid is better
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mens sexual choices are being subsidised by a the women they impregnate n b the state that has to pay for them men suffer way way less consequencescosts for their poor sexual choices
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not welfare for women if the main beneficiaries are kids both male n female n their custodial parents you have to be poor n raising a kids alone theres no welfare for being a woman is aged care all about supporting women too since most of the elderly are women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i disagree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,from denmark yes and i opted out and havent paid taxes in many years soo you dont work or what
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,low fto strikes again lets not pay to create more low ftos pls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes they are in the third world we are obviously talking about the first world here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women suffer consequences but most of those consequences are lessened to near nothing by men and the state
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and thats mens fault somehow do you need to be reminded that we are talking about modern society here the same one where birth control and abortions are a thing women can do whatever they want with their bodies and that includes choosing whether or not to have a child they cant put the blame on men for that anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,boohoo heres the worlds tiniest violin playing for the women who slept around and refused to give the child away to adoption
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they can easily abort or give up for adoption or safe haven do not have to become parents
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre kidding right i have two children im married to their mother i expend enormous amounts of time and money on them probably of my total life time is spent with them i spend enormous amounts of money to feed house clothe educate insure and obtain medical care for them if i divorced their mother the state would make damn sure i continued spending that money what are you even talking about
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and an even greater disproportionate number of men incarcerated of course that doesnt matter though because men dont rank on the progressive victim hierarchy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,see this makes me incredibly glad that you and people who think like you dont run the world ohhhhhh the naivety look who just got elected usa president
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,see this makes me incredibly glad that you and people who think like you dont run the world who do you think runs the world those people arent compassionate theyre cold blooded psychopaths they have no problem with mass slaughter aka war to achieve their goals wake the fuck up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women where considered mens property at one point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which was viewed by some as a form of sexual slavery im talking to you its your post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the western world doesnt really let men conveniently forget about anything they or their ancestors did that make them look like absolutely terrible human beings so no most men who are behind on their child support payments are in prison not all obviously there are some out there and yeah im not fully red so i think thats bullshit and ive said as much here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but where is your blame for the father i dont intend to date the father also if the father transparently was an asshole shes one as well for having dated him long enough to have a kid by him i know feminists love to think that women who end up as single moms only got into that situation through no wrongdoing of their own and that women only date abusive assholes as some consequence of low selfesteem gaslighting and other sorts of psychological manipulation but as usual thats just them focusing on a very narrow demographic that supports their usual narrative making women look good and men look bad lso your hatred of single mothers calling them shedevils is clearly driven by your frustration that these women in their prime removed themselves from the smp are you illiterate here for your convenience the full sentence even among single moms the shedevils who have next to no redeemable features and will do basically everything to first get you hooked and then squeeze you out are a psychopathic minority and btw i see several guys on these threads who ended up with single moms and have all sort of excuses as to why their particular single mom girlfriend deserves sympathy at trp they usuallly didnt seriously date them and those who did dont remember them too fondly that said i too have had flings with single moms and have various degrees of sympathy for them doesnt mean that id date them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure i agree with that did you expect me to disagree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you mean your warning is having zero effect and im sorry that you live in fear of my rebukes so much so that you refuse to lend your brilliance to the threads i create oh no wait im not sorry
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,got it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,itd have been spelled out in your plan now i have to pay for that and maternity leave and my own contraceptives still that seems fair s
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in a civil case a finding of guilty httplitigationfindlawcomfilingalawsuitafterajudgmentcollectingmoneyhtml if one cant afford the child payment how does adding debt help one pay it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not criminal what happens is when the guy doesnt pay almost always because he cant hes put in jail for contempt of court the sanction for disobeying a court order is a finding of contempt and the sanction is usually a fine or jail and its jail until the order is complied with hes now in a catch he cant pay support so he unintentionally but unavoidably disobeyed a court order hes incarcerated as punishment for contempt hes in jail because he cant pay the fine if he could pay the fine he would have paid the support he cant earn the money to pay the support because hes in jail he stays in jail because he has no money to pay the support to obey the court order and purge the contempt finding its not a criminal issue its a court orderobedienceinability to pay issue im surprised you dont know this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course it does culling the unsuitable improves the herd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,questioning your views regarding this specific issue is what you mean i am sure explain to me exactly how depriving young college women of the chance of having all the sex they want and keeping their ncount low actually helps women rather than desperate lowvalue men who hope to wife them up explain to me how not supporting women in need and indeed making the sweeping assumption that they are irresponsible for being single mothers despite not knowing the circumstances serves women explain to me how those ridiculous divorce laws which only benefit men help women explain to me how restricting abortion rights like conservatives want to do is in any way good for women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you do realise that those programs exist because otherwise women would not be hired under the excuse that they are less productive and get pregnant as soon as they are hired right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yup im in those certain fields and i have never felt discriminated against i think its because i am not looking for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your experience may be different from other women i wasnt talking about stem btw i was talking about things like marketing or any management position really
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most men with who can be made to pay and who actually do pay would still pay the change is presumptive not practical
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think it was fairly clear youre saying if women can raise for cancer research they can support planned parenthood given that money is a finite resource more for pp is probably going to equal less for cancer research
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,someone has to create the incentives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i should have explained if you take our laws now as the baseline some of your changes could be seen as punishments or disincentivizing if you prefer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the baby does not have a right to someone elses money not the father or the tax payer rights are to be free from things not happening to you not entitlements to others working for you ie free speech is the right to not have the government come after you its not the same as a right to people listening i mean is this true though if a child is abandoned do we just leave it there or does the state step in clearly kids have some sort of right to guardianship yeah when the parents fail to provide that the government compensates im not an expert on this by any means so maybe im full of shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ehh maybe certain men grow up thinking that sex is a riskfree endeavor thats solely about pleasure but it was drilled into all of the kids in my family male and female cousins alike that consent to sex is consent to risk of pregnancy or disease period
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the baby does not have a right to someone elses money not the father or the tax payer minors have the right to be financially supported by their parents
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not fair that women are the ones who have to go through a painful pregnancy life isnt fair this option is better than the option where the guy can just take no responsibility after getting women pregnant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you flip it around its just as unfair but is also less practical by virtue of it being the womans body and not the mans the woman gets to choose whether or not she opts for an abortion if its even available both consent to the risks inherent in sex but women just happen to have an option men dont due to their biology you cant get someone pregnant and then expect them to abort relieving yourself of responsibility if they dont that line of thinking assumes that abortion is an acceptable action to take when its something noone should be conpelled to do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not at all inconsistent the baby is a part of the mother until it is born you dont get a double murder charge if you kill a pregnant woman once the baby is born it becomes a separate person
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if the issue is that women dont have sufficient access to abortions the solution is not to hold men responsible for the children the solution is to increase access to abortions i agree with this but judging from whos currently in office who a majority of men voted to elect no doubt many of those men also support legal paternity surrender i doubt this is going to happen regarding and the point is having sex means understanding that there is a small chance that a pregnancy occurs and being willing to take responsibility if it does women have had to deal with this risk for centuries and millenia
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really there are some things a society deems worth socialising n other things that arent this is not strange or inconsistent if one isnt an ideologue there arent any programmes that regulate the calories or diets or drinking habits of ppl on medicaid n medicare
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and he knew that when he had sex with her so he should have asked her about her opinions re abortion pregnancy is a risk that you take on when you have sex both parties know about it fucking protect yourself dont whine when you have unprotected sex with some conservative girl and she doesnt want to get an abortion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,person doesnt make a baby its we fucked up and therefore we must both take responsibility in the event where she keeps the baby because otherwise he wouldnt have to pay child support she is taking responsibility by taking care of her baby raising them as well as financially providing for them he is only paying a really small amount of money id say he still gets the better deal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not fair but its better than the other option where men dont have to take responsibility at all its not fair that women are the ones who have to suffer through months of pregnancy either but life isnt fair so get over it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure i follow how are mens sexual choices being subsidized any sexual choice that might result in monetary loss that loss is borne by the man personally no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont live in denmark anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,low fto people create art spontaneity and youth culture high fto people create neurotic behavior and inceldom you need both in society like the yin yang twins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the point is that its not lack of consequences as demonstrated by the fact that there are ample consequences n unwed motherhood is rife even in countries with much worse consequences
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bullshit being a single parent is difficult for most people make all the moral judgments about them you want but lets be honest here poverty rates are high as hell for single parents nevermind the timefinancialopportunity cost of raising a child on your own
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where did i blame men im simply stating that claiming that women dont by and large suffer consequences of unwanted pregnancy is a silly claim
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill play an even smaller 🎻 for men who bust nuts in random women then cry about having to pay for their own flesh n blood
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but they often dont obviously and then they deal with the consequences of that choice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,were talking about those evil single mothers what are you talking about either a woman is married to the father n theyre sharing the childrearing burden or shes raising her kids alone hence shouldering almost the entirety of the burden while the man does fuck all theres no normal scenario where men pay more or experience worse consequences than women for sexbabies if you divorced your wife youd have less expenses n more money to spend not less
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the prison industrial complex is real and although most of the focus is on minorities dont think that white men arent affected but the problems in society tend to first concentrate around the marginalized groups and then spread to middle america
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men arent imprisoned for fun
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and look at how quickly people are going to realise they fucked up by electing him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not really related to the sort of consequences that i envisage
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women could still divorce a husband for cheating on her beating her abandoning her or being a drunk or a shiftless layabout and women did get divorces for those things because a lot of men did those things women didnt have to marry if they didnt want to women could marry whom they wanted if they didnt want to marry any of the available men they didnt have to and no one forced them to they might choose to marry because of societal or economic pressure and they might have chosen guys they really didnt want to marry or were attracted to but thats not absolute control over a woman and a lot of women did that thats not absolute control or indentured servitude thats a woman lots of women making a rational decision based on the facts and available alternatives thats not absolute control if anything it was her choice and her decision to marry bob the beta and no one forced her to do it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wives not women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and i mentioned in the op i dont want to have this thread derailed with that side conversation if youre truly interested in having a discussion shoot me a pm or start a thread yourself otherwise stay on topic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most who are behind are in prison umm no most who are behind are getting away with it women dont report them because they dont want to deal with the drama or the guy shows up at the last minute with presents and a little money and expects the woman to shut up and be happy that he even graced her and his kids with his presence and she better not report him im not saying there arent guys in prison for lapse child support but there are droves of guys getting away without paying or paying very sporadically
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have a source that most men who are behind are in prison
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how about we blame both of them how about we distribute blame evenly between the two adults who created the child i knew it you are mad at the moms because they had a baby and are no longer appealing for you to date sorry dude must be rough with that shrinking pool of women who qualify as dating material in your book good luck with that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the cost of obesity far outweighs the cost of single mothers why is your anger directed so virulently at them it seems a bit disproportionate is it because these women took themselves out of the smp by having a kid search your feelings
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,be civil
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually i think you are right on this one because currently rps response for your little troll post is actually pretty reasonable udaveofmars currently has the top comment and his proposal to eliminate welfare and in turn bring responsibility for actions by both genders instead of society paying for their mistakes is fair imho and its bp thats flipping out because they are gonna lose their social welfare and safety net
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and i have to pay for your prostate surgery and your brain injuries from choosing to play violent sports your testicular cancer your erectile pumps your penile implantsand the world doesnt even get a new cute baby out of it it just gets more of you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the us maternity leave is rarely taxpayer funded i think you know this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no idea how it works in other countries but it doesnt work like that in the uk afaik its more like you either mutually agree a child support agreement when you split otherwise you take it to court and they rule how it should go if you dont pay the court can chase you down for payments same as if youd lost any other civil case but theres no extra damages involved
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the state in which i practiced family law i understand what contempt of court is in ky once charged you go to criminal court not family court unless thats changed recently i havent practiced family law there since
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even if it did fuck the herd im gonna be dead by that time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,explain to me exactly how depriving young college women of the chance of having all the sex they want and keeping their ncount low actually helps women rather than desperate lowvalue men who hope to wife them up where did i say that cut and paste it explain to me how not supporting women in need and indeed making the sweeping assumption that they are irresponsible for being single mothers despite not knowing the circumstances serves women the government is not the sole source of support for those in need so if youd like to help them you will not be stopped no baby comes into the world except by a womans choice not to abort it and no woman is a single mom except by her choice not to give up for adoption so if they cant afford th ebaby it is always de facto irresponsibilty on her part to not abort or give it up fro adoption explain to me how those ridiculous divorce laws which only benefit men help women how does it benefit men women and men can still divorce nofault in my system they just cant get a presumption of custody or anythign but half of jointy titled property this would benefit the party thats not breaking their vow without fault if a man filed for no fault divorce he would forfeit almost all the marital assets this benefits women why do you presume restricting the financial remuneration for no fault divorce will only benefit men why should eeither sex who didnt break their vows for no cause be subject to the current regime of asset distribution explain to me how restricting abortion rights like conservatives want to do is in any way good for women cut and paste me wanting to restrict abortion rights i believe in abortion til months you literally addressed nothing i worte and attributed views to me i dont have im not your straw conservative im not a conservative at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you even know what you are talking about social programs social security medicaid section food stampsetc etc etc i dont need government help and i dont like that other people have come to expect and rely on government help
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and probably realistic about your abilities whatever leve they are
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are thousands of charities thousands many for utter nonsense theres no reason to think money cant be raised for abortion clinics and if women would rather donate to art museums in nyc than abortion clinics maybe thats evidence women dnt really care about abortion as much as feminism does why would women have to choose between donatign to cancer research and abrotion rather than say donating to the aspca or funding starving foreign children
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i said remove incentives and disincentives if you read what i wrote i said nothign abotu creating them the current regime of cs and assistance laws incentivizes female behavior that distorts the smp i would do nothing but remove that regime
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no children dont have a right to guardianship the state provides guardianship because the state has an interest in ensuring that children arent abused and are supported and in protecting human life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im literally quoting feminists i agree with lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,re read what o wrote write entitlement to others resources it means being free from government stopping you from doing something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i object to your use of the word equal because it is not until viable nonpermanent birth control becomes widely available to men i think giving men the option to not financially support a child they did not wish to father is the most fair thing lawmakers could currently do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one is saying women should be compelled to abort im just saying that women are the only ones who have a choice after a pregnancy happens therefore sex is currently not considered consent to parenthood for women but it is for men i object to the word equal being used here the only way this will become equal is when better birth control becomes available for men right now it would sure help men a lot to give them an option to not be financially responsible for a child they did not want to father
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh yes you do get a double murder charge if you murder a pregnant woman past the first trimester at least in my state non lawyers shouldnt try to law
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but as soon as you socialize something youve left it to the state to deem what it can and cant just because ebt doesnt regulate calories now doesnt mean it cant do so later i dont really have a problem with helping people who need it but the second i have to help is the second where i apply conditions or i have the sanction to judge other peoples actions mercilessly blue pillars dont want society judging people for their sexual actions fine but if thats the case then keep me out of the cleanup but they dont want to keep me out of the cleanup
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres an argument going on now to limit ebt to certain food items things like doritos and oreos and sodas are on the chopping block not to be covered because they are not nutritionally essential things like bred veggies and meat would be all it takes is for a bureaucrat to rubberstamp the measure this makes common sense and i dont have any problems with it but when you give one bureaucrat the power to approvedeny one thing you also give the guy next in line the power to do the same thing except they might not approve or deny the things you personally like every liberal wants to increase the scope of government but is then shocked and appalled when that power is given to the next regime who will do with it what they want
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont get this kind of thinking youre bp forgive me for assuming but im going to make an educated guess and say that you are in favor of birth control contraceptives and abortion do you base your advocacy on those things solely based on how it affects you or do you advocate for those things because they provide benefits to other women or because you think they are good for society im going to guess again that you advocate for birth control abortion and contraceptives even if you do not use them because you know they make people better off does that sound fair well same as you i am completely protected from unwanted pregnancy i have a wife we use protection and if we didnt we would be completely fine with having a kid just because im in a good state doesnt mean that i suddenly have no say in how the system treats men there are others out there who could benefit from a systemic change even slight ones like male birth control whole problem solved right there just protecting myself is just a way to stamp out dissent imagine its and the issue of abortion is first coming to social consciousness how many people had said you dont need an abortion if you just protect yourself would their arguments have held up to scrutiny do yours
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,person doesnt make a baby yes yes she does it takes two to make a fetus one to let it develop into a baby unless youre arguing that a fetus is a baby in which case youd have to agree with me that abortion is murder and should be abolished she is taking responsibility by taking care of her baby raising them as well as financially providing for them if shes financially providing for them then he shouldnt be forced to pay he is only paying a really small amount of money id say he still gets the better deal easy for you to say youve never been in his position there are men whove lost their job and cant get their obligation reduced thanks to the democratbacked bradley amendment they are then found in contempt of court and are thrown in jail they can never get a job again because they now have a dirty record they are now in a cycle of unemployment and imprisonment hell one of the black guys who was shot by police was wanted for child support funny how blm made a stink about the police but not about the child support system that set the cop after the man in the first place
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre the one who suggested child support is ideal because it makes life more fair you said it yourself it isnt so get over it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a man n a woman have unprotected sex poor sexual choice on both their parts she gets pregnant she has to pay for all the financial costs of the pregnancy n childbirth the physical n health risks he has costs at this stage the child is born she has to change her entire schedule n lifestyle to accommodate raising a child so she bares all of the social n lifestyle costs he has social n lifestyle costs he can continue living exactly as he was before in terms of his day to day life if he pays cs most lowincome men dont she gets gov assistance she still bares the bulk of the financial costs he has a relatively small financial cost or no cost if he doesnt pay his illegitimate child is raised n paid for by the mother to a lesser extent the state whose costs are higher whose sexual choices are being paid for by pplentities other than themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is true but the low fto s need to be reigned in so they dont sink us all how much youth culture or art can you create without consistent food plumbing electricity etc i guess a lot but theres still an argument for reigning them in
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok there are consequences but not bad enough to deter them and the taxpayers should not be bailing these people out of their own poor life choices i have a feeling that if all the handouts went away some women would be less keen on fucking losers hours within meeting them or at least they would get th free abortions my plan is offering
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i made no moral judgments i observed that consequences women face are lessened and reduced the impact is softened a lot very much so free food free medicare free medications free fucking everything paid for with taxpayer money and charity all of society pulls together to make it easier for single moms no one is ever ever allowed to judge a single mom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uspeltspelt did above men create plenty of negative externalities by doing what they want with their bodies in my view youre partially culpable for continuing to argue his point above you should clarify how your view is different if it is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i feel sorry for them if they were women they would have had the choice to abort or use birth control beforehand or even put the child up for adoption they just wanted to be able to have carefree sex without consenting to have a child the way women can now they are on the hook for years of money for one night of fun his body no choice and if they are in the us they can be imprisoned if they cant pay thats far to high a penalty if you ask me the mother had a choice to abort or put the child up for adoption even after the night of fun happened he had no such choice this system is fucked until men at least have widely available nonpermanent birth control
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes raising her kids alone hence shouldering almost the entirety of the burden while the man does fuck all um do the words visitation and child support mean anything to you theres no normal scenario where men pay more or experience worse consequences than women for sexbabies child support men pay out the ass for child support there are men living in studio apartments while their ex wives and baby mamas live in houses and apartments paid for with their child support money while ex wifebaby mama fucks a series of new men if you divorced your wife youd have less expenses n more money to spend not less if i divorced my wife id be one of those studio apartment guys while i paid about of my income in child support and probably temporary alimony
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,neither are non white people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then elect someone privately similar to him but public ally more palitable lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,go on then give me a bullet i have to think twice about biting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women where very dependent on men to provide for them a long time ago you are correct women did not have to do anything in fact no one has to do anything if pulls a gun on you and demands your wallet you do not have to give it to him if a woman wanted to live a comfortable life the only choice really was to get married now women can make their own money and support themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we dont have to remain topical on threads there are side conversations all the time in posts and threads so im not bound by demands to stay on topic and my comments have been on topic anyway besides youre the one who brought up slavery upthread about comments
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most who are behind are in prison umm no most who are behind are getting away with it according to an of noncustodial fathers not paying child support are not doing so because they are in prison show that most poor men do not pay their child support which in any other heartstringjerking liberal diatribe would be met with endless amounts of sympathy but here its men so fuck em im not against fairly enforcing child support up to and including incarceration but the bar for what will send a man to prison for child support now is absurd and the ease with which you cast judgement on these men is clear evidence to what degree mens lives dont matter in a system governed by feminists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how about we blame both of them again we dont want to date the guy that a guy who impregnates a girl only to bail leaving her to fend for herself and the kid as well is an asshole isnt really controversial sure feel free to blame him for the situation in fact as a woman you actually should do so to that sort of man to avoid a similar fate befalls you but regardless of how much blame he shares in that situation its her share thats important for another man she was complicit in everything and without her consent none of this would have been possible you are mad at the moms because they had a baby and are no longer appealing for you to date nah there are enough women who arent single moms what does rile me up is that theyre commonly presented as selfsacrificing angelic saints who got into their predicament through no fault of their own but only through the machinations of evil men when thats pretty far from the truth thus blindsighting naive men who oftentimes quite frankly did neither expect nor deserve what was coming for them into falling for these women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why is your anger directed so virulently at them because men are put in jail when they cant pay child support to single mothers doesnt matter if they lost their job doesnt matter if the kid isnt even theirs doesnt matter if they were cuckolded by the single mother doesnt matter if the child was a product of rape by the single mother because the state enslaves and then incarcerates the father whenever the spiteful mother wants to fuck him over nobody has been put in jail on behalf of obesity correct me if im wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i wanted to see how you looked i would ask your words are enough to explain why you dont stuff them in our faces
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and i have to pay for your prostate surgery and your brain injuries from choosing to play violent sports your testicular cancer your erectile pumps your penile implants no you dont none of that coverage is required for you to pay for none of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im sorry i meant maternity care which even for single men i know i know muh society
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sorry thats how it works in the us as far as i know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wow debtors prison but thats willful and flagrant refusal to pay when you can most of the time men arent paying support because they cant and in most states thats court order disobedience contempt order imposed and the guy goes to jail where he sits until the contempt order is purged which he cant do because he cant earn the money to pay the support because hes in jail
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the herd cares just as much about you as you care about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you said that the government should give no funds to abortion clinics you clearly realise this means many clinics would shit down and there would be less availability of abortion for women it would also mean that lowincome women who either get raped or get pregnant could not afford an abortion in short you are restricting their rights to have sex without consequences hence the college girl analogy surely you will understand that women sometimes have to leave their partnerhusband because of abuse or because he simply does not contribute to child support such a woman obviously ought not to give up her child why should she how on earth does this benefit women it only benefits men who do not want women to leave them because they can hang the you will not be able to keep the child threat over them and that would persuade women to stay in abusive relationships anyone who is even remotely educated regarding divorce will know that many times proving that the spouse is guilty is complicated and abusive men will also hang the threat of a woman losing her children over her head to prevent her from leaving him how is this good for women again also why on earth shouldnt unmarried men pay child support you seem very punitive towards unmarried mothers why not do the same towards unmarried fathers also i do not understand your last comment why ought women to be more cautious in the sexual market someone who is prowoman would instead give them more freedom not benefit men by making them cautious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i believe in abortion til months lol well the more abortion laws the more babies left in dumpsters is true they used to tax single moms at some point in history at the same time as condemning abortion before modern abortions wtf i dont think society will get passed the strong moralising about pregnancy and fetal remains least not any time soon thats a big part of the problem imo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes thank you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not humanly possible to know of everything about the person you marry this incentive would also punish women actually everyone who have the misfortune of marrying what they fully believed was a great person but who turned out to be hiding abusive tendencies addictions a different sexual orientation etc i am definitely not trying to imply that being lgbt is on par with addiction or abuse just saying its something that could cause problems in a marriage especially when not discussed beforehand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but women already make wise choices only many men are abusive and as such deserve to be punished by the law if a man is irresponsible and does not want to pay child support of course he must be jailed married or not although i would give him the right to opt out if and only if he pays full abortion costs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you do not need government help but millions of other women in a vulnerable position you yourself could have found yourself in had you been less fortunate do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe because its a crap choice to make it doesnt matter how many charities exist the end result is the same other causes will get less so cancer funding doesnt suffer but the starving foreign kids get screwed and i wouldnt be surprised if lots of nonfeminist women didnt care that much about abortion a pretty large number of people cant be arsed to care about a particular issue until it directly affects them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,okay so we remove the current regime but were still left with something i dont believe there is a natural state do you if there is not then you are removing one regime and replacing it with one you prefer one much closer to marriage yes i guess what i am asking is if there is a bigger picture that you believe society should be confirming to and what that looks like to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this exactly doesnt make it a right tho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,under the law if the parents arent providing financially for their children and leaving them to starve the government does step in and take the children away though and the parents go to jail for that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,until viable nonpermanent birth control becomes widely available to men its called a condom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which state because i have never heard that if you cause a pregnant woman to miscarry is assault not murder
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just because ebt doesnt regulate calories now doesnt mean it cant do so later yeah nah i wouldnt hold my breath on that i dont care about ppl judging ppl 👩‍⚖️ away
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont really get how this is relevant to what im saying i believe that people should have access to birth control men and women but men arent likely to take that option if presented this does not change the fact that a its not fair to force people to undergo surgicalmedical procedures that they do not want to and b ultimately the foetus grows in the mother so its her choice and c its poor social policy to let fathers procreate and not do anything to support their offspring the decision that leads to the baby is something two people make if you dont want to take that risk on board talk to the women you sleep with and make sure theyre okay with abortion learn to use protection properly pregnancy is a controllable risk re sex seriously apart from it feels nice for individual men to get off scott free how is society benefited by the policy youre advocating having lots of children supported by the state instead of their fathers is good why exactly fuck that shit im not paying tax so dudes can procreate with impunity this is a goddamn fiscally conservative position so dont try and come at me with omg bp liberal good for society etc this is not good for society its good for irresponsible men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont support jailing them either i think that if they are financially unable to pay the state should cover it but if he can pay he should pay because its his baby however the majority of deadbeat dads actually get away with it a very very small minority are being jailed for not paying child support
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it will never be fair but it can become more fair
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whose sexual choices are being paid for by pplentities other than themselves obviously the womans because at every stage of this process she has the choice to prevent the costs in the first place its both peoples choices to have sex but only the woman has any say in whether the child will be born and the costs incurred theres no reason why that choice should be subsidized unless men get equal say andor full subsidy for their choices as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we americans live in an almost postscarcity society where a food supply is guaranteed plumbing and electricity are almost guaranteed as well peak oil is pure bullshit put forth by enviro freaks who are jealous of people with suvs and lambos farmers and food processors actually buy food insurance to insure steady costs and sales this is why things like droughts dont matter anymore your jobs main threat isnt a mill in china but a robot in the us right now the term outsourcing is just a way to shift the blame we have a better climate for a lot of foods than many areas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only men bottomtier women have access to are bottomtier men who arent marriageable or even interested in marriage n most unwed motherhood is from nonmarital ltrs not fucking losers hours within meeting them ppl want to have babies humans gonna human no matter how poor or dumb or marriageable barring forced sterilisation you cant stop the bottom of society from reproducing there were unwed mothers in victorian england there are unwed mothers all over africa n latin america their kids beg in the streets n have miserable lives sometimes they prostitute themselves yet ppl still do it so either we revert to a world like society with child poverty n child beggars or welfare i choose welfare n so do most ppl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,conversely you should stop jumping to conclusions and maybe work on some reading comprehension come to think of it though considering part of the negative externalities speltspelt was referring to would be stds then yeah i suppose i do partially blame men for the spread of stds but i didnt mention that in my original comment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men have condoms which are super cheap n easily accessible its entirely their fault if they choose to rawdog women n risk pregnancy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do you believe in welfare queens driving through the ghetto in their cadillacs too are you really trying to argue that visitation cs even come close to the to n time burden of pregnancy childbirth n fulltime parenthood cs ill believe it when i see it not now where every study ever done on the subject shows men have more money postdivorce n its women n their children whose financial wellbeing declines sometimes to the point of poverty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people of colour are routinely given harsher sentences for the same crime than white people if brock turner had been brocky tandamurra or lebroc tamar he would have got a darn sight more than months
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rolling a turd in glitter still leaves you with a turd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the sort of relative social stability that you take for granted would be over i will leave you to consider the consequences of this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a woman choosing between marrying a man shes meh about and staying single and consigning herself to a life of hard work and spinsterhood is in no way akin to highway robbery
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really if her family was middle class or above she could live with relatives for a comfortable life as a spinster and not have to work or have kids she would do chores and errands for the family she stayed with if in the upper class the maids would do almost everything for her shed be considered scandalous but her life would be of comfort
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no archwinger brought it up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ai do not agree under any circumstances sending someone to prison for not paying child support that is cruel and unusual punishment in my book you are in favor of sending men to prison for it so you are more heartless in that respect than me of men do not pay their child support why the fuck not its not like women get to say oh i just dont feel like getting up and taking care of my kid today ill just let them starve and go unbathed and uneducated and rot in the corner why the fuck are these men not getting off their asses and paying for their kids
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,those men made bad choices they should not have hooked up with those women they should take personal responsibility for their actions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im going to have to check the stats on that especially the of single mothers without any financial support from the father because he just doesnt feel like paying for the kids he created versus all those scenarios you just mentioned combined i have a feeling you will have to swallow your words when you compare those numbers also i do not support putting anyone in jail for lack of child support payments i support garnering wages etci make alimony payment to my ex who refuses to get a job do i like it fuck no but i still do it some people are irresponsible turds some of them have vaginas some of them have penises
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,report incivility and the mods will remove it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,higher premiums
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,free maternity care for months is a lot cheaper than the cost of care for a sick or disabled child whose mother didnt get proper prenatal care
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do people keep talking about going to jail for not keeping up with payments in the us then this does not happen here as its purely a civil matter not criminal
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i agree about it being a vicious cycle and im against it too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the herd didnt care about me when i cared about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you said that the government should give no funds to abortion clinics you clearly realise this means many clinics would shit down and there would be less availability of abortion for women it would also mean that lowincome women who either get raped or get pregnant could not afford an abortion women raised a billion for breast cancer why cant they do the same to fund private abortion clinics theres more to the world than the government surely you will understand that women sometimes have to leave their partnerhusband because of abuse or because he simply does not contribute to child support wer eyou unable to read that i continued to allow both nofault and fault based divorce and used the distinction for asset division abuse is traditional grounds for divorce in the anglosphere anyone who is even remotely educated regarding divorce will know that many times proving that the spouse is guilty is complicated and abusive men will also hang the threat of a woman losing her children over her head to prevent her from leaving him you do not have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt clear and convincing evidence would suffice if you called the police on your husband for abuse and he went to jail obviously thats prima facie evidence of abuse for the purposes of fault based divorce the question thats being asked is how i would fix the smp in some ways do you understand that it is in both mens and womens interest that divorce should not be easy and would promote better choices were were asked what policies wed present to fix the smp changing the asset division the way i am goes towards helping that also why on earth shouldnt unmarried men pay child support you seem very punitive towards unmarried mothers why not do the same towards unmarried fathers unmarried women have a unilateral option to terminate a pregnancy of adopt out i believe in this unilateral option this unilateral option however in my opinion entails women having both all of the rights and all of the responsibilities it short circuits the never married fathers responsibility rights and responsibilities go hand in hand i wouldnt want the unmarried father to have a say over whenther she aborts and i dont wan thim saddled with her decision not to abort either also i do not understand your last comment why ought women to be more cautious in the sexual market someone who is prowoman would instead give them more freedom not benefit men by making them cautious i was answerign a direct question here pose don the sub abotu how the smp could be fixed did i say it should be men and women live together in tandem and still want each toehr overbalancing the smp in favor of the female imperative disincentivizes men form providing woimen what they want from them i dotn beleive in fixing anything with top down bpolicies only repealing market distorting policies i have no desire to regualte female sexuality who they choose to marry or what they choose to do only who pays for those choices when and how
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also why on earth shouldnt unmarried men pay child support you seem very punitive towards unmarried mothers boohoo they could have given it away for adoption but they chose not to thats what happens when theyre offered a financial incentive they and they alone made their bed now they must lie in it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all of this still has not explained to me a whether you would like these regulations to be implemented or were only answering the question b why exactly you do not want the government to pay for abortion if you know it is essential for women to keep their rights mind that i am also british and pay for everyones healthcare through the nhs and i therefore genuinely have no idea how anyone could think it is not the governments responsibility to ensure women have safe access to abortions so that men cannot in no way control them through fear of pregnancy because there will never be such a thing as a defunded abortion clinic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agree with everything except if you called the police on your husband for abuse and he went to jail obviously thats prima facie evidence of abuse for the purposes of fault based divorce not in the age of the duluth model male victims go to jail when they call the police on their abusive wivesgirlfriends
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the man made his bed when he got her pregnant now he is going to lie in it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why exactly you do not want the government to pay for abortion if you know it is essential for women to keep their rights because im a libertarian and originalist in constitutional construction and quite frankly i dont think my views or suggestiosn could be understood by someoen who not american or doens understand our constitutional paradigm and our arguments about the governemnts role my positions are with regard to the governetns role in things not in restricitng women susan g komen foundation raised billion for breast cancer let them raise money for abortion clinics like i said i have no desire to restrict abortion or anything just who pays for it and how women have no right to their sexual liberty on othe rpeopels dimes let the get abortions and pay for them let them have sex all they want and pay for their babies if they cant afford them let them give them up for adoption
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,evidence for a divorce not metaphysical proof no system we decide on can be perfect mine is more just
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he could leave the country he could skip town and change his name
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,okay so lets imagine these rules are implemented women raise money for abortions but there isnt enough money some clinics shut down women get raped they cannot access safe abortion they try other abortive methods they die or are forced to give birth other women have sex with contraceptives but the contraceptive fails and again not enough money for their local clinic to stay open no access to abortion how on earth is this prowoman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if an arrest made under duluth model as used as proof of the man being abusive that fucks him over doubly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes and we could have the police after him and he would have to lose his jobhouse as he leaves the country sounds fair enough
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its a speculative system for restoring equity to the smp there wouldnt be a duluth model in my legal system
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,better an exile than a slave
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rp is about changing yourself to fit the worlds idea of success feminism is about changing the world to fit your ideals of success
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminism is a social movement rp is individual
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,both their respective internet communities are represented badly by loud extremists who need to get out more
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,two things first this the red pill shames men who are underachievers and dont strive to become strong alphas is wrong rp doesnt shame men who dont try to become strong alphas whatever that means what men in the manosphere do is shame men who whine and complain like punk ass bitches who wont do anything to improve their shitty lives what men in the manosphere do say is that they have no time to help men who are unhappy with their lives and dont want to do anything about it except whine bitch moan and complain if your life sucks and all you want to do is bitch and complain and youre not willing to do things to make it better then go the fuck away second rp isnt feminism because rp doesnt seek political power to effect its goals rp is about individuals setting and meeting individual goals there is no team man contrast feminism which clearly uses political power and men to effect its goals women is about the herd banding together and serving womens interests as a political voting bloc while at the same time using that bloc to wield political power to purchase political influence threaten politicians with ouster or ostracism if they dont comply and get government goodies for themselves in the form of benefits and make work bullshit jobs to present the appearance of financial independence the ideal is to accumulate consolidate and wield political power for the purpose of realizing goals and gaining material wealth the ultimate goal is getting power taking it from men and using it at the expense of men and using the arms of government culture religion and politics to do it using law culture and social pressure to subjugate men to female power under pain of social ostracism job loss criminal penalty imprisonment and death theres no team man there is very very clearly a team woman always has been always will be just notice how women will close ranks around a woman under attack even red pill women will go all girly and emotional about shit just like typical women even red pill women will side with blue women against red pill men give a woman a choice between siding with women who are ideological enemies and men who are ideological allies and a woman will always always side with the women regardless of ideology or viewpoint every time the only time a woman will side with a man is if the man in question is her man women are for either team woman or her man never for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think that the error that you make is that you conflate the views of a small minority of counterproductively antimale feminists with the core principles of feminism and assume that theyre all the same of course i anticipate a counterargument about trp but if youre talking specifically about trp rather than the mens rights movement youre specifically selecting the extremes of the mens rights movement for your comparison some examples of this the red pill shames men who are underachievers and dont strive to become strong alphas feminism shames women who are submissive and do not strive to be strong and independent women are naturally manipulativedark triad men are naturally violentabusive red pill cc riders fucking handsome chads follow their biological imperative but to us they are degenerate broken human beings feminism men who want young fit women follow their biological imperative but to us they are insecure degenerate porn addicts red pill liberals are retarded feminists trump supporters are retarded red pill where have all the unicorns gone feminists where have all the good men gone the red pill talks of women and their appalling behaviour when in truth it refers to young attractive women its members want to fuck feminists talk of men and their appalling behaviour but refer to the top red pill incels think women are evil for not liking them and having standards fatugly feminist women think men are evil and misogynist for not liking them the red pill sees female sexuality as a destructive force within society and thinks society should contain it and shame women for unchecked hypergamy feminists see male sexuality as a destructive force within society and are in favour of society containing it and shaming men for it teaching boys not to rape containing toxic masculinity etc that last one having the added bonus of containing the spurious assertion that teaching boys not to rape seeing male sexuality as destructiveshaming men for their sexuality i dont think theres anything in the core principles of feminism that indicate those things now if you wanted to claim that the extremes of feminism are the equivalent of trp i think youd have a more sensible argument but with respect i think that youre making the same mistake that a lot of trpantifeminist types make feminism is bad or based on flawed ideas because this particular group of crazies call themselves feminists further and i may be mistaken on this and would welcome being corrected you seem to be trying to create similarities between ideas that ostensibly seem comparable until you consider that one side of the argument has data to support its claims some examples red pillers life is more difficult at work because female bosses are bitchesgender quotasconstant fear of false harassment accusations feminists life is more difficult at work because male bosses dont take you seriouslyits a maledominated spaceconstant fear of sexual harassment red pillers men are alienated in school feminists women face discrimination in stem red pill popular culture has been infected by feminism and white men are portrayed as idiots or abusers feminists popular culture is deeply patriarchal and women are just represented as sex objectsdamsels in distress hello anita sarkeesian red pill men are getting oppressed by the school systemcorporations feminists women are oppressed by the wage gap now i understand that a lot of redpillers find strange and illogical ways to discount much of the data that feminists rely on which isnt to say that some of that data isnt flawed and have some strange and illogical interpretations of other data that they then rely on which isnt to say that they dont have some legitimate data as well but so too does every group who challenges the mainstream consensus on an issue that and my perception of an absence of any compelling arguments from the redpillers side of the fence is why i see the abovequoted points as roughly equivalent to these manmade climate change is real manmade climate change isnt real the world is round the world is flat vaccines are proven to be safe vaccines cause autism disagreeing with a position doesnt automatically make your position somehow equivalent or the counterpart of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i cant change your view because i agree lol but there is a caveat modern feminism is the female version of the mens rights movement however early feminism was more similar to the antiracist civil rights movement i would say that the lgbt movement is similar to this as well only one state currently recognizes a third gender the mens rights movement doesnt just include trp and pua but also legitimate political movements like fathers rights sites like the art of manliness as well as miscellaneous stuff like the similarly there are extreme feminists who are similar to trp but the majority of feminists seek legal and social change in order to even out the playing field just like mainstream mens rights
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as rollo would put it feminism is a manifestation of the feminine imperative i would argue that the manosphere as a whole is the manifestation of the male imperative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminism is not based on reality and doesnt care about reality it cares about gaining power and status for women and nothing more feminists would be fine if society burned while their policies and wishes are enacted rp is here to describe and explain reality it does not push mens rights or womens rights it says this is what reality is like go forth and do what you wish with it a woman can study rp and use it to her advantage it lays out womans game and how to control men and make them yours how to get a more powerful and higher status man rp is neutral at the end of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trp is about recognizing how men and women operate in society in the present for the purpose of elevating your sexual strategy feminism is about trying to change how men and women operative in society in the future for the purpose of minimizing discrimination in all facets of life trp is a realistic view of the present world for the purpose of getting laid feminism is an idealistic view of the future world for the purpose of getting fair treatment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the female version of the red pill would either be mistixs pink pill or the women in the movie heartbreakers lesbian separatists or radfems would be wgtow im not sure what the female equivalent of the extreme incels would be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,read your first three bullet points and stopped there you clearly have zero idea about what feminism is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,itt people who deny the fact that anita sarkeesian is required watching material literally hundreds of feminist classes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if anything red pill would be the male version of feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i came to say this there are certainly a lot of parallels and this is the main differentiating factor rp is mainly about changing your personal disposition to something that makes you happier
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminism is about changing the world to fit your ideals of success more like change the world to not be destructive dont blame rape victims and protect the perpetrators rule of thumb wife beating shouldnt be legal children cant consent to sex wave feminist judith lewis herman women arent natural masochists suffering from penis envy phyllis chesler nancy chodrow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes this is true
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rp has missionaries even if it wants to strangle them and trp has done a terrible job of separating itself from the rest of the manosphere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who are the reasonable feminist leaders who you think dont get enough publicity i ask this question a lot and the only answer i ever get is my momfriendroomie nobody ever says heres this great theorist who tells the truth about how the wage gap is exaggerated by the mainstream feminists except the ones who suggest christina hoff summers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,death really
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ahhh if only you were right ever heard of schlafly the antifeminist she said there is no such thing as marital rape and campaigned long and hard against women achieving equal rights with men trump paid honour to her not long ago i hope shes burning in fucking hell also margaret thatcher said feminism is poison and wanted to restrict abortion laws older women are split in two groups the lively happy fun crones or grandmas who like younger women very much and always side with them as you say and the embittered old hags who hate other women and are jealous you wouldnt believe the shit these women can spurt they are like evil school mistresses
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i love the its just a small minority argument from feminists i bought that right up until the aca was passed shifting costs from objectively more expensivetocarefor women to objectively less expensivetocarefor men equality is women fighting tooth and nail for everything theyve got like men do feminism is about using the state to force men to give shit to women thats not equality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wage gap dont real lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that last one having the added bonus of containing the spurious assertion that teaching boys not to rape seeing male sexuality as destructiveshaming men for their sexuality yes teaching boys not to rape comes with the implication that they need to be taught but women dontit is based on the precept that masculinity at large compels them to harm women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a small minority of counterproductively antimale feminists whats this small minority bull puckey name me one prominent feminist in academia apart from christina hoff summers who stands up to the rape culture garbage just one name ill check it in google scholar to test that shes really prominent in womens studies if you cant name anybody or you name somebody and she actually does follow the feminazi party line my point is made its not a few fringe crazies the lunacy goes right to the bone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only part of this whole red pillmanosphere thing that is a movement or thinks it is is mras mens rights activists like paul elam and dean esmay and john the other they are people who think they can accumulate political power and use it to effect policy changes not going to happen because men dont work that way theyve been at it for at least years and have accomplished exactly nothing in the way of real policy change or making lives better for men the rest of it is just individual solutions for individual men not a movement and not solutions for men as a bloc because i dont care about other mens solutions they can get their own solutions ill get my own i dont need other men to agitate for me to get them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but the majority of feminists seek legal and social change in order to even out the playing field you mean tilt the playing field in their favor show me any mainstream feminist organization or feminist campaign that pushes for equality in an area where woman are privilaged and men are discriminated against
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,similarly there are extreme feminists who are similar to trp but the majority of feminists seek legal and social change in order to even out the playing field just like mainstream mens rights hardly modern feminism seek legal protections to benefit women on the precept that men as a class are oppressors and privileged operating on principles of collectivism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is a world of difference between what feminism claims to be and what it really is learn it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,red pillers obviously do not all believe in those extreme ideas the same goes for feminism but if you go by extremist stereotypes the general guidelines of both ideologies are pretty similar
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,spoken like a true christian zealot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminism has its beginnings as a political movement concerned with womens legal rights rp is not a political movement for this be accurate youd have to compare feminists to mens rights activists the feminism is a sexual strategy comparable to rp belief is more than a little misinformed dont people rpers included complain that feminism teaches women to be totally independent of men which doesnt sound like an effective sexualdating strategy to me i dont think women were ever turning to feminism to improve their chances with men they wanted feminism to create better conditions for them to achieve their goals and not be discriminated against harassed etc the objective problem with feminism is that it largely achieved its original goals ending legal and ecomomic disenfranchisement of women but refuses to end or redefine the fight because its leaders have never really been interested in equality among women what you get in century feminism is keeping the torch burning by positioning the inconveniences and complaints of upper middle class educated cis hetero white women as oppression and the only oppression that matters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have it a little backwards the mgtow part of the red pill is the male version of feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i thought trp was just a form of sexual strategy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a diva is the female version of a hustla
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the thing about all that most of those comparisons are comparing rp standard to a few voices in feminism so the comparison is not exactly that strong plus feminism is about making change in the world and rp doesnt concern itself with that theyre not very much the same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i didnt make any comment on the value of either movement i just pointed out a pretty fundamental difference one changes themselves one lobbies society to change for them a more accurate comparison would be mgtowmras and feminism since they have more expectationslobby towards of society to change to fit their world view
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rule of thumb wife beating shouldnt be legal not be destructive sounds congruent with ideals of success rule of thumb wife beating shouldnt be legal yeah no httpwomenshistoryaboutcomodmythsofwomenshistoryaruleofthumbhtm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,joke reply surely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,more like change the world to not be destructive what makes you think feminism is about that and not change the world not to be hostile or dangerous for women its not like feminism is about addressing or really doing anything for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,none of this has anything to do with wave campus feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,please link me to some veritable source that says blaming rape victims legal physical assault kids having the lawful right to give consent are actual things ive never seen anything mainstream or from trptbp that remotely condones that shit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rule of thumb wife beating shouldnt be legal lol literally was never a fucking thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,part of what the wave wanted to do was destroy patriarchy destroy the family unit and replace it with communism also rule of thumb is a feminist lie
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminism is not some peace seeking ideology it doesnt care about peace it wants safety and comfort for women at best which is not at all the same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you cant take the first and second feminist movements goals and claim that third wave feminism is equally as important first and second wave feminism accomplished things that were good for all but feminism as it is today is for lack of a better word toxic we are talking about trp which did not exist during wave feminism when compared to feminism today
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most women definitely suffer from penis envy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes this is true so you admit then that rp is based on reality feminism is based on idealisms which makes them incredibly opposite rp too hates idealisms and rejects all of them as they are not reality and never can be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what missionaries all of manosphere is individual why would rp want to separate ideologically from it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know enough to justifiably name anyone though camille paglias name sticks out in my spotty memory what i do know is that the vast majority of tumblrinas and coddled american millennials who are held up as representative of feminism in discussions like these sound really immature compared to firstwavers and feminist activists in places like india middle east eastern europe etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,phyllis schlafly was not red pill or the manosphere she was a paleoconservative a traditional conservative they use political power all the time because they have political goals and public policy goals they are also the whitest of white knights political conservatives are not in the slightest concerned about men or mens sexual strategies or mens improving their lives to political conservatives men exist to get jobs make money get married and provide for a reformed slut and her not his not their her children political conservatives and tradcons are all about men need to man up and marry the sluts stop playing those video games get to work make money keep your dick in your pants sex is for procreation only your life exists to serve women you are required to throw yourself under the bus to save the life of a woman who wouldnt even give you the time of day same with thatcher a politician with a conservative worldview not red pill in the sense of looking out for men mens sexual strategy at all conservatives are as feminist as you are
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no that isnt what feminism is im reminded of sam harris talking about water being two hydrogens and an oxygen if someone says that that isnt how they choose to think about water the conversation is over
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no its based on the idea that there are social influences that ought to be countered not at all that masculinity compels them to harm women im genuinely baffled about how you reach that conclusion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the rape culture stuff isnt garbage next
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same with wave feminism plenty of the newer feminist conversations are individual solutions for individual women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bicycle argument or i dislike feminism and mgtow sucks so they both are alike
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtow doesnt concern itself with changing anything so not really an apt comparison the mra is the more obvious analog to feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtow is purely individualistic unlike feminists who demand everyone else to pay for their shit and create safespaces for them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really the mra part of rp is the male version of feminism because mras are the ones who foolishly think they are part of a movement that can gain and then use political power to achieve its goals mgtows are either truly going their own way in which case they dont care about politics or policy or incels who cant get laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i didnt make any comment on the value of either movement i wont quibble on your intent i agree its a fair point about changing self vs changing society at least on paper if more rp actually improved and less blaming but my intent wasnt about value but misrepresenting feminists and putting words in their mouth actually the blatant misrepresentation of feminists women in general is where rp lost its credibility with me so it is right for ppd posts to call bs on that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do mgtow lobby society i thought they are the people who considered the offer of ltrmarriage and decided that it they dont find it worth it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah no please try again read your own reference which said that domestic violence was real the myth is a quibble about the origin of the phrase rule of thumb which existed before the wife beating cases in here article quote yet there can be no doubt that wifebeating was once common and in most legal circles acceptable if it didnt go too far the origin of rule of thumb may not be accurate but the culture that it calls to mind was real debunking the myth of the origin of rule of thumb may be fun but that doesnt make domestic violence past and present mythical
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,answered here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,none of this has anything to do with wave campus feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not saying rp condones it im saying rp sounds ignorant of the history of feminists battle with these issues then rp assumes feminists hate men from arguments which were developed fighting power abuses from the past but rp does have a lot of guys assuming rape victims make it up rp does also advise men to use techniques used in domestic abuse authorities fighting dv like lundy bancroft say that rp is very bad for men being asked to change abusive behaviors which are destroying marriages
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,part of what the wave wanted to do was destroy patriarchy destroy the family unit and replace it with communism ill quote wave feminist judith lewis herman about a longtime overlooked feminist agenda having fathers interact more with children many of the causes that women have supported most passionately in the last century—temperance animal rescue the suppression of vice—can best be understood as attempts to get men out of the barroom the game pit the whore house and into the home although the womens liberation movement is often perceived as hostile to maternity and child rearing the welfare of children has always been a central concern of feminists and struggles for child protection are historically linked to struggles for womens rights
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminism is not some peace seeking ideology thats because slavery is the bad kind of peace hey retro quote capt apollo i would like to see more happiness liberty for everyone but its not free clinging to lies doesnt help either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im glad you acknowledged waves as good for humanity there wave had many fronts some were sex positive and inclusive because of trp i read wikipedia entries on andrea dworkin funny this line from one of her books reminds me of trp this is nihilism or this is truth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,first and second wave feminism accomplished things that were good for all but feminism as it is today is for lack of a better word toxic im not sure radfems are creating the toxic though when i first heard of andrea dworkins in the i couldnt bring myself to read her books they seemed ott imagine my shock decades later to wonder if she had a point when i saw glimpses of misogyny as a fetish on tumbrl just as there is always some radfem there are guys out there proving them right in some cases im not saying either men or women are morally superior that oversimplification is the blindness causing problems growing up means recognizing who individually is worth listening to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,honestly what does this even mean
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,up until one hundred years ago it was reality that a woman was a possession of her husband and had to submit to him turns out we feminists are pretty good at altering reality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mra is collectivist isnt it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would rp want to separate ideologically from it if you are a white person you should understand we have always separated ourselves from others so we wont be stereotyped as heavily we have even tried to do it for black people i cant even tell you how many times i have heard someone say shit like this i like black people just not niggers why on earth would anyone want to be associated with mgtow is beyond me so it makes sense to try to get as far from them as possible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plenty of red pillers have a conservative world view many support trump in fact what i read a lot on the red pill is that sexual strategy is just about enjoying the decline because the good old times when you had stable family units are gone do you really think anything of what i quoted from thatcher and schlafly can be categorised as even remotely feminist schlafly was borderline clinically insane would begin speeches by thanking her husband for allowing her to attend the conference
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,forces that only affect men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but it is garbage even the name of the concept is misleading
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not a movement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no are you familiar with second wave feminism it was wgtow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtow doesnt want to conform to the rules of the game same as with feminism trp adapts to the game in its current state and attempts to win even if the game isnt in their favor it doesnt try to change the rules mgtow and feminism are unhappy with the game both of them want the world to revolve around them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtowradfems
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtowsradfems
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtowsradfems mras now feminism mra was literally started by mainstream feminism thats why theyre lefty fags
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most of my complaints about feminism have to do with institutional feminism the people writing the definitions lobbying the government publishing the studies and distributing massive amounts of money theyre about as dishonest as the most bs politicians you can imagine most feminists are blissfully unaware of the criticisms of the people in charge of their own movement or maybe they dont care which is even worse this is why censorship of ideas is a massive problem from feminism there is plenty of very well reasoned criticisms backed in science which are handwaved away as misogyny you will never stop and consider it might be true if you are standing in the echo chamber
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they dont actively lobby but theyre in love with ideas like marriage strike
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,domestic violence being real at the time doesnt mean that rule of thumb is accurate but if you want to stand on the fact that historically it was ok to beat your spouse to some degree then fine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what makes you think change the world to not be destructive when you litterally quote a single wave feminist saying children rights are part of womens rights and say nothing about change the world to not be destructive the last sentence in what you quoted is really the kicker here struggles for child protection are historically linked to struggles for womens rights how does that have anything to do with change the world to not be destructive answer is it doesnt it more furthers proves my point if anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,obviously not that was a pleasant read im talking about the other of feminist propaganda
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but rp does have a lot of guys assuming rape victims make it up yes a lot of women do and they arent rape victims because they werent raped false rape has an proven false with up to a grey area this is a crime that often has no distinction from one of the most common acts on the planet save a few words being saidnot being said unlike other crimes there is a lot more motivations to be had in accusing men of rape from covering up infidelity to it being a great punishment regardless of convictions and the state also often has ordinances to not punishing those who make false reports for fear of dissuading real rape victims from coming forward ie the justice of men is secondary to the justice of women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres a much more famous feminist quote deeds not words it seems to me that feminists have pushed for laws that make the home a more hostile place for fathers to be at the same time theyve pushed for women to have freedom to pursue their own vices so you probably find more mothers these days in bars and nightclubs going on girls nights out and having casual sex with random men heres a quote from an sister of famous feminist kate millet it was kate invited me to join her for a gathering at the home of her friend lila karp they called the assemblage a consciousnessraisinggroup a typical communist exercise something practiced in maoist china we gathered at a large table as the chairperson opened the meeting with a backandforth recitation like a litany a type of prayer done in catholic church but now it was marxism the church of the left mimicking religious practice why are we here today she asked to make revolution they answered what kind of revolution she replied the cultural revolution they chanted and how do we make cultural revolution she demanded by destroying the american family they answered how do we destroy the family she came back by destroying the american patriarch they cried exuberantly and how do we destroy the american patriarch she replied by taking away his power how do we do that by destroying monogamy they shouted how can we destroy monogamy their answer left me dumbstruck breathless disbelieving my ears was i on planet earth who were these people by promoting promiscuity eroticism prostitution and homosexuality they resounded
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one can or will ever claim that the fight for equality was required it was the next logical step in humanity but the truth is this is the great war of our generation are we going to let it destroy the definitions of masculinity femininity fatherhood motherhood and family units or are we going to put it in its place and let it do good without giving it too much room to do bad people dont seem to get that feminism as it is today is no longer required it is meaningless and accomplishes nothing more than demanding special treatment for women wave and wave feminism did that too but they were focused on more important issues where women actually were disadvantaged our fathers and mothers made sure that out feminism focused on the actual topics as opposed to entitlements for women it is now our job to do the same and for us there are no actual microlevel topics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats reasonable however in our society feminism has more influence than a few men on tumblr
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can pee anytime anywhere you cant haha patriarchy wins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,up until one hundred years ago it was reality that a woman was a possession of her husband and had to submit to him turns out we feminists are pretty good at altering reality those are laws not reality womens solipsism hypergamy machiavellianism immaturity is reality of their nature that cannot be changed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is it is also generally not considered a part of manosphere their tactics are feminine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like it or not mgtows are rp as well they along with marriedtradcon rp just arent pua rps
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you must be trolling conservative red pill their interests and goals diverge sharply when it comes to sex marriage family etc the red pilltrump love affair is all about trump as alpha and that will come to an end after he loses in the general which he will i dont care whether conservative female politicians and lobbyists are feminist or not the point is that conservative women are not about men mens interests or mens sexual strategy conservatives and conservative women in particular demand that men fill gender roles specifically to serve womens interests ive said it twice now what about that do you not understand
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,plenty of red pillers have a conservative world view many support trump yes not all conservatives are red pill but some red pillers are conservatives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,forces that affect the different genders differently ill say to you what i say to your counterparts in the antivaccine flat earth and creationist movements if you have a good reason to reject the data and disagree with the experts ill be glad to agree with you ill even applaud when you get your nobel prize im not holding my breath though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im happy to concede that the name is inflammatory and alarmist and inaccurate but the underlying idea seems pretty accurate to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont see how trp isnt a movement i play metal and its a movement much more than its a genre
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the bicycle thing a womanman needs a manwoman as much as a fish needs a bicycle
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not the world women but youre right we refuse to play by the rules women define because they are retarded
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in terms of unrealistic expectations and views sure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,unlike radfems we are men and men are superior who built the patriarchy men did therefore our actions have actual weight and make actual sense even if there are similarities
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is plenty of very well reasoned criticisms backed in science which are handwaved away as misogyny i hope you mean more than evo psych here also most social science observational studies arent definitive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are they or are they just opting out what i know about mgtow came from who is hilarious but may not be representative his argument is simple and quite strong i think statistically most marriages now end in divorce with no fault divorces there isnt much you can do to prevent it youre going to lose half your stuff in the divorce then he asks the question why enter into this contract given the statistical probability that you are going to lose half your stuff down the line
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,domestic violence being real do you agree dv is real my point was dv was real were getting offpoint and into symantics over language history
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how does that have anything to do with change the world to not be destructive i dont know what to tell you if you dont understand that the world is less destructive when children are more protected economically psychological
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im talking about the other of feminist propaganda there is a criticism of the manosphere that it argues with imaginary feminists in their heads and not as a result of research of real feminist i dont argue that trying to destroy family is wrong instead its how you paint targets with that brush
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes a lot of women do and they arent rape victims because they werent raped media coverage internet echo chambers make that danger seem a lot more likely than it is plus it just leads to more disconnect between the sexes because quote and no one hates truly false allegations like a rape survivor but we should balance that with the knowledge that the official numbers are not an accurate representation of the truth
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,quite a story the woodstock era was full of them what matters is what became influential and kate millet now seemed more focus on practical things like reproductive freedom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it was the next logical step in humanity but the truth is this is the great war of our generation are we going to let it destroy the definitions of masculinity femininity fatherhood motherhood and family units what do you mean next logical step in humanity i agree with you on that but that the fight for equality was not required also are you certain it isnt a slew of other things eroding family such as economic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,our society would be lucky if feminists were the only source of toxic p
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,haha i am envious of that but i suppose other than that and the fact men dont get periods and dont have to be pregnant and give birth im not envious of men i like being a woman and more specifically me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,immaturity lmao my fellow millenials who happen to be male are the very opposite of mature but i will agree on machiavellianism that is just due to the fact that autism is the extreme manifestation of the male brain it has been said so the more male your brain is the less good you are at controlling social interaction but you will be better at other things like stem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is it generally not considered a part of the manosphere when i think manosphere i think rp mgtow and mra man centered spheres also since when is acquiring power and effectuating change which you believe is good for you and others like you through politics feminine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my read is that mgtows found what they saw to be common cause in rp and joined it im not convinced that mgtows were a significant factor in the creation of the red pill even the adament never get married ever thing is a fairly recent development as far as i can tell
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtow may be rp but that doesnt mean rp are mgtow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what you say about the conservatives is very strange as i said many red pillers do not want to fill the fuckboy role but rather be the patriarch and support a stay at home mom who is a submissive unicorn not a post wall reformed party girl this is the key difference that way conservatism and the red pill work together because they are all about limiting the freedom of women there is more to the red pill than the fuckboy part and marriage is deemed important by many members
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dont forget leading conservative figure paul ryan said in response to the infamous trump tape that women should be championed and revered funny enough i missed the public outcry from feminists who found that statement offensive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre actually equating feminist dogma with science youre pretty fucking nuts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not a movement because it doesnt have the backing of all men the disagreements in policygoals are so deep as to be directly adverse and because the way men work doesnt lend itself to movements for the benefit of men as a group individual men do not care about men as a group making sure that men have power as a political entity men just dont care about that men care about themselves individually and those in their tribe i dont care about men having political power i dont need to change the world i dont need to fix the world for all i care everything outside a mile radius from me can burn down and go straight to hell i care about me and mine i care about getting what i want and need and fuck everyone else or more accurately im getting out of other mens way so they can get what they want and need and so long as those other men are not in my way or hindering me i dont care what they do and they dont care what i do
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is metal a movement to you punk is more of a movement than metal is
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont say enough words in your comments to really understand them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a man needs a woman like a bicycle needs a fish
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh i agree there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is much more and it is mostly steeped in data analytics and the actual policies of feminist organizations feminism isnt immune to criticism of which plenty exists they never address and acknowledge just deny and call the critics names shouldnt that set of alarms its essentially the same shit they accuse donald trump of doing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you can put all the kids in an underground bunker and you still wont protect them from the destruction they are still going to be exposed to violence and what have you putting kids into protective bubbles like what we are doing today is going to cause more harm than good more so viewing it as a womens issue and not a mens issues as well further supports my point as i already pointed out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,real feminists you dont have the luxury of eschewing your relation with the toxic majority that comprise modern feminism they do a disservice to those like you who would actually study and work towards creating a meaningful dialogue about the real issues that women do face due to its widespread popularity feminism will never be successful the few rational voices are drowned out by opportunists trying to push their own agendas and hordes of idiots riding the outrage wave because it feels good i dont doubt for a second that beneath the ocean of bullshit there are a few kernels of truth at the core of feminism but i would never even consider affiliating myself with the movement for the same reason i could never take a group like migtow or even major political parties seriously theres simply too many idiots saying too many stupid things and theyll never get anything good done the umbrella of feminism just encompasses entirely too much crazy and make believe at this point and i would advise you to identify hah as an independent if you ever want to be taken seriously
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,media coverage internet echo chambers make that danger seem a lot more likely than it is no the law and atmosphere does i also love how you dont afford the same logic to rape though lol women see a lot more false rape statistics like the following created by law enforcement fails svan is a lying blowhard i dont believe her sorry
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that article is fucked jesus how many times can you get fucked over by different people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well since the beginning of time i would argue that man has attempted to create a world of security where one can live their lives without being afraid of some physical threat without needing protection i think in the last years or so despite all the atrocities that were committed we have achieved that goal up until this point women have been tethered to men due to their need for physical protection now that women were no longer tether to men for that reason and women were no longer holding men back again due to that reason the fight for equality was required but it wasnt meant to be the way it is today we live in a world where women are given preferential treatment the need for equality was in fact the need for women to have the opportunity to build build corporations governments hell countries with the purpose of helping out humanity the equality that we needed was the kind that allowed women to work alongside men to create a better world instead we have women getting to the top after climbing on top of men men who were forced to throw themselves in her path to let her move up that is the kind of equality that is being fought for today and that is what isnt required i see it every day in the corporate world women in top positions who were only put there as protection for the corporation from accusations of sexim those same women when in management meetings contribute nothing and when they do contribute they say the dumbest things the men have to take their thoughts into consideration because god forbid a man tells a woman that what she said was retarded this is what happens when a person is given something without having to earn it just think about the difference between a man who is given billions and a man who starts with nothing and earns his billions women obtained the opportunity to earn which is what the fight for equality achieved but then they started pushing to be given no man or women who achieved anything of worth in human history was given anything in order to progress we have to overcome
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no thats not true at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre envious of not being able to give birth oo i wish i could do that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,immaturity lmao my fellow millenials who happen to be male are the very opposite of mature as usual the woman focuses on what men do and misses the point but i will agree on machiavellianism that is just due to the fact that autism is the extreme manifestation of the male brain it has been said so the more male your brain is the less good you are at controlling social interaction but you will be better at other things like stem youre wrong about why women are machiavellian not surprised your rp understanding is next to zero mostly just you backwards rationalizing things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mra is thoroughly derided by trp and definitely advocates a feminist approach to stoicism change that will never ever work iliza schlesinger jokes about that in her comedies that men have it kind of shitty in some areas but that shed probably just make fun of a guy seeking help the bpers in here will no doubt be indignantly outraged about this but the rpers in here see that for what it is a rule of the game that will not be changed i have no desire to give my money to a government that will dote upon people who are interested in a free ride and women have no desire to give their platonic or sexual attention to men who arent at least outwardly putting on the appearance of strength bp thinks it can change both with media bitching how do we live in a society where microsoft makes billions in profits while people go hungry and laws it cant mras make the same mistake and worse actually believe that society will give a shit about the plights of men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am obviously not going to say that you dont have a right to your beliefs manosphere isnt about social change it is about responding to social conditions such as they are it is in our dna whining men who complain about how world is so unfair get laughed at incels and mras fundamental reason is that evolutionarily men who whined and expected handouts died lonely and hungry deaths women who whined and expected handouts were typically cared for in some way by the collective the result is that among males whining behavior is both rare and undesirable of course men belly ache in private groups with friends but it usually invites jokes and laughter stoicism independence creative personal responses to social and environmental realities dislike of either being seen as weak or have a fellow man embarrass you by demeaning his manhood etc are defining characteristics of male behavior freaks like mras and incels cant expect to be treated as a part of the team maybe it is not easy for females to understand this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,depends on what you mean by the rp if your thinking is that rp is simply pua culture then obviously mgtowtradconsmarried rp are all excluded however culturally rp is seen as a metaphor for a man waking up and seeing the reality for what it is with warts and all the response to that realization obviously varies and depends on what brought you to rp most men arent interested in becoming puas because they didnt become rp for lack of sexual success the incel fa awkward teenager crowd most become rp because of betrayal in their mid to mid of course a small number of divorced men do decide to play the field without getting married again and those are what can be called soft mgtow rp however even those dont bother with the entire cornucopia of strategies that puas worship they just dont have to
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is this meant to be an exercise in high school logic some rp are obviously mgtow
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,conservatism today is absolutely nothing like patriarchy at all many rpers want wives and a successful mutually satisfying relationship with one woman the sahm part is optional the submissive part is not optional the unicorn is optional no they dont want reformed party girl sluts they are about avoiding sluts for marriage their desire for those women does not make them conservative or align them in any way with conservatives youre just wrong about this conflating and confusing political and policy goals with mens sexual goals mens sexual goals are not political or ideological theyre deeply personal to each individual man the difference is that men dont look to a movement or a political party to get them what they want sexually or in any other way they have to look to themselves and only to themselves to get what they want men just dont work the way women do men dont band together as a monolithic political bloc like women do they never have the republican party and the conservative movement in no way at all likes what trp stands for male self determination and male sexual strategy men maximizing their ability to have the kinds and quality of sexual relationships they want go to any goper or conservative and tell himher what trp and the manosphere are all about youll hear theyre sexists theyre immoral men who care only about sleeping with sluts the gop doesnt represent the interests of rpers at all conservatism is not at all about limiting womens freedom conservatism as it exists now is even more feminist than some of you feminists political conservatives are all about serving women telling men that they have to do literally anything a woman wants shaming men for not marrying not having kids encouraging women to divorce men for unhappiness in their marriages encouraging women to run their households through sexual deprivation and bitchiness the people youre talking about paleoconservatives are viewed as cranks and nuts in the gop they have no power and no one listens to them except chicken little feminists like you your claims are frankly ridiculous
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not a reason to reject data and disagree with experts its almost like you dont actually have one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,doesnt have the backing of all men feminism doesnt have the backing of all women the disagreements in policygoals are so deep as to be directly adverse this is true of feminisms like sex negative vs sex positive terfs vs trans activists or more accurately im getting out of other mens way so they can get what they want and need and so long as those other men are not in my way or hindering me i dont care what they do and they dont care what i do feminism calls this agency
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,metal is a movement because its a whole bunch of different genres that have something the movement holding them together for example summoning and belphegor are both nominally black metal but they are very different as are nine inch nails industrial metal and hair metal bands like poison metal is more of an approach to playing than a genre in itself it is also an aesthetic and the metal movement is not exactly only one scene a movement includes many scenes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they never address and acknowledge just deny and call the critics names shouldnt that set of alarms im not sure which study you mean here but no argument that feminists have had a lot of critics from day one
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the umbrella of feminism just encompasses entirely too much crazy and make believe at this point and i would advise you to identify hah as an independent if you ever want to be taken seriously are you an evolutionist if you are ive got a joke
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women obtained the opportunity to earn which is what the fight for equality achieved but then they started pushing to be given are you referring to divorce law
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no thats not true at all only feminists are toxic have you been to the dmv or watched cnn
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you serious i dont want the magical experience and all the shit that comes along with it and after ofc i dont have kids now ask me again in like a year because i probably will by then and i might change my tune
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why are you associating bp with liberalism and collectivism its not a political movement just like yall are not all trump supporters and even those of us who are liberal and collectivist arent all ultralib fuckwit communists who want everything to be collectivist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if your thinking is that rp is simply pua culture i dont i dont know much about pua and have never really been interested in it but from what i do know i dont have a lot of respect for it on the other hand i believe that if men reshape themselves into the kinds of strong powerful masculine men rp advocates they wont need any pua hacks to find success they will do naturally what the puas are trying to do because thats how strong powerful masculine men act however culturally rp is seen as a metaphor for a man waking up and seeing the reality for what it is with warts and all thats true unfortunately what i often see is men not seeing the actual reality but focusing on the warts which exist in abundance dont get me wrong and seeing a reality comprised of those warts to me that simply looks like the stereotypical cynical reaction of an idealist not someone who is dealing in actual reality as it is and dealing with it pragmatically as is advocated by rp most become rp because of betrayal in their mid to mid but that still represents a lack of sexual success does it not failure is failure and men want to understand why they failed and how they can be successful and avoid failure as much as possible going forward however even those dont bother with the entire cornucopia of strategies that puas worship they just dont have to as i said above no one has to i didnt have a cornucopia of strategies to reference when i was discovering the secret to success i just went out and tried shit and figured out what worked and what didnt that and i saw the importance of developing myself as a strong powerful masculine man in life both for the purpose of getting women and just for living a great life in general that said i do wish i was a aware of a few of the rp strategies i would call them perspectives related to ltrsmarriages before my marriage hit the rocks whats additionally painful is that i knew on some almost subconscious level that i was setting myself up for failure or at least playing with fire but i had bought into enough of the idealism that surrounds the modern ideas of marriage and gender roles that i could sell out on that knowledge had i found rp previous to that i would have been able to trust and listen more closely to my gut
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ya some i think most of the mgtow who also consider themselves rp just want to be rp the issue is that mgtow typically carries a lot of delusions about their own failures which would prevent them from being rp simply because they are too busy blaming external forces rather than themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah she doesnt care dude shes here to further her feminist bubble its literally her career to write for feminism
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what data what experts the datathe real data not surveys created by ideologuesshows that we have a rape rate of in or so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminists have actually accomplished all of their goals mras have accomplished none of theirs women care about all women men care only about those men in their tribe and all others can fuck off
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to say something is a movement implies its trying to accomplish something i can see some genres of metal as movements like thrash is rather political black is rather religious and satanic or antichristianity but death or folk or doom are aesthetic and not trying to accomplish anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i believe that human beings are divine space unicorns that gave their souls to power the great machine that destroyed the galactic overload xenu in the cataclysmic final battle that resulted in the big bang ill hear your joke though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who said anything about divorce law i mean that women obtained the opportunity to earn as in they fought for and won the right to have access to education and to have a career but that wasnt enough for them it wasnt enough because they wanted progress to happen faster instead of fighting for it the way men did instead of paying for it themselves the way that men did instead of truly untethering themselves from men they chose to keep themselves tethered they fought and demanded that men solve their problems by forcing men to step down to make way for women they fought for quotas they fought for laws that forced corporations to force men to pay in order for women to be given positions for example as opposed allowing corporations to choose to replace women who get pregnant they forced the law to make that illegal women were given the opportunity and the ability to take the hard route and the hard route would have been to start their own corporations and offer maternity leave to their fellow women that is real change real progress that is overcoming a challenge that would have earned women respect and it would have proven all of the claims that first and second wave feminism made that women are equal to men instead they forced corporations trust me when i say that management both men and women think less of a woman who takes maternity leave but its illegal for them to show it ive worked for a few companies and its the same everywhere in the meeting when someone says angela applied for maternity leave everyones response is are you fucking kidding me women had the chance opportunity and the tools to earn the respect by proving that when they are given equal opportunity they become equal but they chose to not earn that respect and instead use their tools to force men to pay for the things they felt that they were entitled to that is one example women in the last couple of decades have done nothing but show that the majority of the claims made by their mothers and grandmothers were false and that all women everywhere only ever fought for special treatment in the last couple of decades women have negated everything that first and second wave feminism did and its sad really
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah honestly you might be surprised but its a shorttime of pain in your life for what ultimately is a cosmic purpose even if youre a total fuckup of a woman you can still help carry on the human race men cant ever do that which yeah is probably why some of us are not too keen on giving women free stem money because theyre not choosing it enough the only thing we have is to be producers anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,see i actually agree with him pregnancy and childbirth is a lot of pain and risk but i think its kind of amazing to be the gender thats able to grow new life inside my body i dont think id trade it if i could but i dont have kids either and its very likely ill change my mind when i do lol not periods though fuck those things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i really do reject the notion that the differences in sexual strategies have no connection to politics perhaps bp isnt the right term i tend to still associate that with feminismsocial justice culture when i suppose technically its just satire of rp but the associations are there im not a trump supporter but i am definitely on the right i definitely support individualism i dont think its unreasonable to analyze things as though people opposed to rp are more collectivist while people who are rp are more individualist you say youre not a marxist which is probably true but a contemporary american liberal has rhetoric that basically stems from the same perception of what is or isnt a problem and honestly advocates pretty much ghee same thing although i personally would rather live under the progressives government than the marxists i could be making an error there though its mostly predicated upon what marxists achieved historically which was widespread poverty destitution and death i really dont think theyre as separate as you insist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think we have much of a disagreement the men who have rp thrust upon them are generally idealists to start with sounds like it was true for you to some extent certainly was true for me anyone who has dated successfully and been married cannot be labeled a sexual failure by definition
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is a hint of truth there however most mgtows i read about are just interested in simplifying their lives without having to compromise on their values getting rid of women is a defensible way of doing that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fathers rights movement is still fighting for custody on the parts of fathers i think that there are both mens and womens rights goals that are left which arent completely fulfilled
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no i believe that human beings are divine space unicorns advise you to identify hah as an independent if you ever want to be taken seriously ill hear your joke though cool its a jokey thought related to carl sagans book shadows of forgotten ancestors about evolution and how human thought sometimes resembles other primates some internet threats against those who identify as feminist quite resemble baboon threats baboons dont use tools either like chimps anyway the outcome is bad science where the data sample set is altered per someones emotion laden agenda
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women had the chance opportunity and the tools to earn the respect by proving that when they are given equal opportunity they become equal you realize that the easiest way around the maternity dilemma is for career women to skip child bearing many guys younger women dont realize that suppressing desire for children is a hell of a lot easier than having them i mention this because ive seen some rp threads complain about career women low fertility numbers and the hard route would have been to start their own corporations and offer maternity leave to their fellow women sounds like a good writers prompt for a science fiction story if a guy did it the hard way when he didnt need to hed be considered a chump also notice the complete lack of compassion for an already overburdened new mother in your statement yeah i get that maternity leave is a pain lots of things are in business but thats not grounds to inflict hate on an entire gender
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats such a sad outlook i value my man for much more than his production contribution you should expect your woman to as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im vain and selfish i guess i dont want to sacrifice my body although i ultimately will im actually pretty eager about having kids
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the fact that a lot of terps on here tend to associate the entire left with sjwism is disturbing i dont associate all of the right with the crazy religious tea baggers i am a progressive liberal who believes strongly in traditional liberal values like prodefendants rights profree speech and amendment i also believe that the wealth disparity in this country has gotten out of control and needs to be addressed and that if we dont have any regulation of business individuals will get screwed relentlessly and unapologetically that doesnt make me a regressive sjwtype also i am not insisting they are so separate i was merely pointing out that its not a political movement and its weird to start referring to bp as collectivists and rp as individualists certainly feminismmra is collectivist but those are political movements and not every bloop is even a feminist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the men who have rp thrust upon them are generally idealists to start with sounds like it was true for you to some extent certainly was true for me oh absofuckinglutely that was true in general not just when it came to women then i did the entirely predictable switch to cynicism thinking that that was somehow more embracing of reality and made me more likely to get what i wanted in life in terms of learning to get what i wanted in sexloverelationships thats when i started my own personal anger phase it took a total rebuild of everything to shake both the idealism and the cynicism what i was left with was a much more balanced and productive sense of pragmatism which functionally left me more positive and less angry than my idealism or cynicism ever had me be and it was then that i could start really experiencing success a success that did admittedly incorporate and build on what i had been learning all a long which lined up pretty well with what pua says works its just that when i wasnt being idealisticcynical i was able to utilize my knowledge of hacks with much greater effectiveness and towards ends that i really felt reflected what i wanted most and then of course my marriage fell apart and i had to go through that process once again as i realized how much idealism i had either carried into or allowed to grow unchecked in my marriage i havent fully reached the levels of freedom and power that i achieved following my last rebuild years ago but i feel certain that i understand where i went wrong and that i can therefore somehow get myself on the right track again incidentally i see the biggest obstacle right now as not women but myself and my own relationship to myself and who i am and what i want which was the obstacle i had to overcome last time around in order to be a successful single dude thats what im focused on even though women arent doing much to help me with that we really do often have antagonistic roles even as we all might profess to want to be complementary to each other anyone who has dated successfully and been married cannot be labeled a sexual failure by definition well i was an abject failure by most definitions i would say then i became a success by many definitions including my own and then i became a failure again mostly by my own definition as outsiders often dont empathize or even sympathize with my sense of failure especially since everyone tends to have a gynocentric view of success and failure so i dont know what label fits at this point lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i get that maternity leave is a pain lots of things are in business but thats not grounds to inflict hate on an entire gender the hate is inflicted when the gender demands others pay for their personal decisions when you burden other people by forcing them to pay for your choices they wont like you very much if a guy did it the hard way when he didnt need to hed be considered a chump also notice the complete lack of compassion for an already overburdened new mother in your statement really because as i said in the corporate world its the men who are given their corporations that are chumps unless they prove themselves the men who built the company brick by brick those men are respected beyond measure you realize that the easiest way around the maternity dilemma is for career women to skip child bearing many guys younger women dont realize that suppressing desire for children is a hell of a lot easier than having them that is the womans choice her choice has a cost and she should be the only one to bear it if she wants to skip childbearing then the cost of that decision is not having children and the benefit would be that she can continue her career if she does choose to have a child a corporations should have the option of replacing her the benefit of her decision to have a child would be that she has a child and the cost would be her career but women didnt want that they wanted both and they lost respect
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is the womans choice her choice has a cost and she should be the only one to bear it every civilization has its own economics dealing with huge costs of the next generation human children are incredibly expensive your attitude reflects our wider societys attitude that its a womans choice like toothpaste brand and therefore she should eat the entire cost of the child along with any man foolish enough to share costs lower fertility rates might reflect the reality of no sale nothing personal just elementary economics its her which gets trashed for the extremely dubious privilege of paying thru her noise to create a future tax payer a book price of motherhood has the economic facts and figures motherhood isnt a reward like chocolate its a hard calling i see the rp blaming womens morals for simple economics if youre just blowing steam on the internet fine but if you are really stem problem solvers then i hope someday youll apply your great mental abilities to the problem economics of modern parenthood
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,every civilization has its own economics dealing with huge costs of the next generation human children are incredibly expensive your attitude reflects our wider societys attitude that its a womans choice like toothpaste brand and therefore she should eat the entire cost of the child along with any man foolish enough to share costs except the expenses arent covered only by her are they even though its her choice to have a baby her body her choice the system forces men to pay for it every step of the way from her corporation have to allow her back with equal pay to birthing costs covered by taxes paid by men or insurance paid by men and then to men being forced to pay child support as it is she isnt carrying the cost of her decision my opinion is if society is going to continue to treat men like the stranger whose rights to the children are determined by the mother then society should also logically start removing the cost of those children from men and forcing women to pay for them if society wants men to be fathers then treat them like father and give them equal access and opportunity to their children as the mother regardless of that though even in our society a person should never pay more to cover a strangers costs if society changed and began allowing fathers to be fathers with equal rights to their parenthood as mothers then richard in operations still should not be forced to pay for stacys decision to have a baby stacy and her mate should pay for it but as it is today women are the only gender given full rights as parents women are the only gender who get to truly choose whether or not to become a parent and therefore women should be the only ones paying the cost of parenthood a part of having rights is the responsibility to pay for those rights the less rights you have the less you should pay now regarding her retirement the fact of the matter is by giving women an advantage in the marital law it is the government that is stealing not only her retirement funds but also the mans ask any divorced man how many years he was set back financially due to his divorce and hell say a decade at least alimony and child support come out of his too the difference is women are given full custody to their children at least she empties her but gets the ability to become a parent the man gets what weekends a month to be that guy that takes us to the park we as a people need to move away from the nanny government format it is unsustainable this format will always demand growth in population because taxation will never decrease growth is extremely risky because it is affected by so many factors all factors act as limitations therefore the foundation that we are basing our society on taxation is risky we need to create a system where the government covers only essential costs and each individual covers their cost of living prior to the sexual revolution families were independent self sustaining units it wasnt a perfect system but it was a better system families paid for their decisions to have a child not strangers families paid for their inability and benefited from their ability to save for retirement not strangers in that time period humans could see the cost of their decisions which meant those decisions had more weight it wasnt a perfect system but in my honest opinion a combination of our current system and the old system is the only way to create a sustainable society in order to move towards that system we have to start removing the nonessential entitlements that people get women in our society get the most nonessential entitlements and therefore that is where we need to start anyway our conversation escalated to something completely different but its an interesting conversation none the less
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we need to create a system where the government covers only essential costs and each individual covers their cost of living prior to the sexual revolution families were independent self sustaining units it wasnt a perfect system but it was a better system families paid for their decisions to have a child not strangers families paid for their inability and benefited from their ability to save for retirement not strangers lets clarify causality if you look at history guilds antiquity etc yes families maintained everybody and children were everybodys retirement plan todays modern capitalist corporate economic system owes more to worldwide industrial revolutions than to a social change sexual revolution start removing the cost of those children from men and forcing women to pay for them already here doesnt trp already talk a lot about the demographics of single motherhood
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im beginning to wonder as to whether or not you are reading my posts i know they can be long and you many not agree with them but you are asking me questions that i already answered in my posts in any case no one can say that the modern economic system owes more to worldwide industrial revolution than to social changes because that is too big of a statement some things were due to the wir for sure but some were also due to social changes since as i said im not sure you are taking the time to read the posts i wont elaborate and let you ask questions if you have any as far as the demographics of single mother hood yes there are a lot of single mothers but that doesnt mean they are paying for it if the average income is and the minimum cost of a car is then most people will have one car now if i come in and say that i will pay of the cost of every car sold bringing the cost of the car down to most people will have cars or cars its like that the reason why there is an increase in single mothers in our society is because society has made single motherhood affordable by forcing men to pay for motherhood i guarentee you if you force the full financial responsibility on the person who makes the decision there will be a lot less single mothers out there i would argue in that situation single mothers would decrease birth rates would drop divorce rates would drop and marriage rates would increase
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im beginning to wonder as to whether or not you are reading my posts i know they can be long and you many not agree with them maybe im being too brief in my replies to avoid tldr ive only been replying with why its hard for me to agree with you i wont elaborate and let you ask questions if you have any modern economics are a huge topic easy to oversimplify so ill handwave arguments which sound dodgy for blaming only the sexual revolution for why extended families are no longer anyones full retirement plan the us wouldnt have had to develop social security if families could be relied on to care for senior citizens long before sexual revolution yes there are a lot of single mothers but that doesnt mean they are paying for it question do you believe public education benefits society should only parents be taxed to support schools or does everyone benefit from an educated workforce the reason why there is an increase in single mothers in our society is because society has made single motherhood affordable by forcing men to pay for motherhood women pay taxes too the new economy has clobbered men more than women do you have any economic statistics showing that men are paying more than women to support single mothers not just hypothetical scenarios the car analogy isnt proof of anything nice story though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the us wouldnt have had to develop social security if families could be relied on to care for senior citizens long before sexual revolution family could absolutely be relied on more than the government i have run the numbers being as conservative as i possibly could as in accepting the benefit of the doubt and the numbers tell me that saving for ones own retirement ends up with them losing significantly less money than paying that same amount of money to the government social security has evolved into what it is today it was meant to be something completely different when it was implemented question do you believe public education benefits society should only parents be taxed to support schools or does everyone benefit from an educated workforce i believe that parents should be raising their children as opposed to the government i believe that parents are absolutely responsible for paying for their childrens education the benefit gained from an educated workforce has a diminishing return the higher the population the less important it is to have everyone educated if of the population lived in homes that could afford education then it would be less important to ensure that everyone has an education in a society with a population of million as opposed to a population of know what i mean with that said we do not live in a perfect world and the purpose of education isnt just to allow people to regurgitate facts its to teach people how to think it has been proven time and time again that education is linked with crime and poverty educating people benefits me directly even if i am single and never become a parent so although i believe that parents should be taxed more i also believe that they shouldnt be fully responsible for the education system if that makes sense women pay taxes too the new economy has clobbered men more than women do you have any economic statistics showing that men are paying more than women to support single mothers not just hypothetical scenarios the car analogy isnt proof of anything nice story though you would be hardpressed to find any statistic that shows how women negatively affect society in fact i would challenge you to show me statistics that prove that women cause more harm than men in any topic at all in minutes i could link that many articles about men feminism has ensured that anyone stating a fact that points out womens faults is labelled as misogynist so corporations do not fund projects that could ruin their reputation so i am forced to use logic women do pay taxes but when it comes to marital law men pay what i like to call a penis tax you may know it as alimony and child support when you examine those you can see that it is absolutely a tax alimony and child support is the reallocation of income from one party to anotherperiod it is not tracked therefore you cant say it is the reallocation of of income from one party to another to be used for the child of the paying party because at the end of the day no one knows where the mother used it taxes in general are the reallocation of income one party to another but this idea is likely another discussion all together so we can leave this idea here and not discuss it further notice how i said that men pay more not that men are taxed more that was for a reason taxed more implies the government directly taxes men for single mothers pay more could include taxation but it could also include indirect payments one example of an indirect payment is the fact that despite the fact that women cost the system more in medical both men and women pay the same premiums a part of the reason why they cost the system more is because of the cost of child birth now as im sure youve noticed i have an easier time explaining my train of thought when i provide examples so ill give one here lets take a society with three people tom gina and sharon in this society each person is taxed and that money is used solely for medical purposes now lets say that all people get the exact same illnesses throughout their lives with the exception of getting pregnant and the cost of treating those illnesses are a person lets also say that the cost of childbirth is a person okay now lets assume sharon goes to another country gets pregnant then comes back meaning the guy that got her pregnant is not tom when the system covers sharons cost of giving birth sharon now cost the system so as you can see sharon throughout her lifetime would use and tom and gina would both only use despite the fact that all three put into the system now why am i arguing that tom pays more than both sharon and gina because gina has a choice to either a have a child and use the that is allocated to her or b not have the child and lose tom on the other hand does not have the same choice he is forced to pay for a portion of the cost for sharons childbirth and for the choice that gina could make logically gina and sharon should each pay and tom should only pay but tom is forced to split the cost of gina and sharons choices regardless of what those choices are i hope this make sense so you see this is one example of how men are forced to subsidise a womans decision to have a baby the key to take from this is choice and the cost of choice if you pay and you are given the right to make a choice then that is fine but if you yourself do not have a choice but are paying in order for someone else to have a choice than you are paying more than the person who has a choice know what i mean now heres another one in our tax system people are given credits for having children and our system gives parental custody of children to women significantly more than they do to men i trust i dont need a stat for you to agree with that therefore mens tax dollars are paying for the credits that women are receiving for having their children assuming jerry and kerry pay each in taxes while married when jerry and kerry get divorced and kerry is given parental custody jerrys income taxes will increase because he no longer is eligible to claim the tax credit meanwhile kerrys income tax will decrease since she is now claiming the full credit in essence the government is taking money from jerry and giving it to kerry my post is getting too long so ill stop here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men pay what i like to call a penis tax you may know it as alimony and child support that would be more convincing if i didnt know women who were paid alimony themselves and for whom could never depend on the man to pay child support what we dont have is an itemization of how much money the man paid vs the woman toward child care but even so you arent even counting sweat equity countless hours of labor even at the cheap payscales for child care also are they his biological offspring despite all the cheating stories actual genetic studies only show false paternity so probability says its his so the phrase parenthood tax seems more apt its not like failed marriages dont hurt her too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,b not have the child and lose abortions cost money too plus birth control pill tom should only pay but tom is forced to split the cost of gina and sharons choices regardless of what those choices are it doesnt say that tom paid more tax than only that he didnt cost as much but it sounds like youd be a natural for deciphering the us tax code your example shows how a simple fair idea turns into nightmare math come april but yes when it comes to medical reproductive costs a dick is much cheaper than a birth canal god help us when they try to even that out in the tax code
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except according to the stats of alimony is paid by men and is paid by women so yes there are women paying it it would in fact be a penis tax unless it is an extraordinary circumstance also are they his biological offspring the questions you need to ask is is he the father biological offspring can mean jack shit for example when a woman gives a man weekend a month to see his biological offspring do you ask are they his biological offspring or not biological offspring means that he should have equal access to them which a man rarely does now sweat equity is a cost of having the child again the phrase her body her choice which should always be concluded with her responsibility she chose to make an investment and its her job to pay for that investment if she wants to share the responsibility then she needs to share the choice and she needs to share the investment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,abortions cost money too plus birth control pill absolutely but if child birth is the cost of abortion would be what i chose not to include it since i wanted to use whole numbers but if youd like to all it means is that gina cost the system more and that she only paid of that which is the other was paid by tom and sharon now we can argue about payments and costs and wed both have points but at the end of the day both you and i agree that in a fair system tom should only pay and that the additional that tom is paying is for the choice that gina and sharon have and logically since a birth canal is more expensive she should pay more lets put it this way if a penis was more expensive there would be an uproar that women pay the same amounts as men despite the fact that they are cheaper
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes tbp is there to mock trpwasnt that the whole point behind its conception
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the blue pill is not a strategy its not even a thing its a satire sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the blue pill doesnt understand that this subreddit isnt all hate and while a lot of the posts are circle jerks the red pill wouldnt have existed if there wasnt these confused men in the first place no we just dont give a shit were not concerned with how terpers came to be terpers we just think a lot of the shit thats posted in redpill subs is unintentionally hilarious if its not outrageous it doesnt get linked to by tbp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im confused because your title mentioned debate which made me think you were referring to blue pill users in ppd but then the body of post seems to solely refer to the tbp subreddit of course tbp isnt offering insightful debate theyre a satirical sub designed to mock trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the blue pill is for laughs a satire place thats not meant to be serious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the danger with the redpill movement is that it becomes or has already become a hate movement the bluepills objective is to prevent this and for them that is a success
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,atheism doesnt offer one shit all it is is the denial of religion and criticizing it heavily but you know what thats ok just because you are criticising an ideology that does not mean you need to put forth a new view or whatever any more than an atheist needs to construct a whole new worldview for people similarly movie and art critics dont actually need to put forward new ideas for movies and art i mean they can but there is nothing requiring that they do so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,must we have a post every other day where this needs to be explained
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is a large difference in the quality of human being between those that come to ppd and those that stay on tbp blue pillers that come to ppd generally are more reasonable and less hatefull the ones that stay confined to the the hate box are mostly lacking in any emapthy or human compassion dripping with hate and anger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but there is a serious level of hate there anger resentment and viciousness are alot more prevalent than any form of humor
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it clearly has a political objective
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,explains a lot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the bluepills objective is to be a hate group of their own and put down the undesireables so they can feel better about themselves i cant go to the blue pill without feeling disgusted at the level of venom hate and maliciousnes in their posts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is what im asking op for clarification on do they mean tbp or blue pill users just as many red pill users make a point to differentiate themselves from trp some blue pillers do the same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can you not see the difference between tbp criticizing people who openly hate on an entire gender and trp advocating rape cheating abuse and manipulation toward females teaching bitter men that their value is only tied to their weight vagina submissiveness or that their feelings are to be ignored etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe but at least in tbp sidebar they call themselves satire sub unlike trp that pretends to be serious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there can truly be a lot of anger on the sub but i see pure satire a lot more frequently
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you slow down the sub to bpm it subliminally tells you to vote for hillary
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,can you point out some hate thats on the tbp sub right now im curious as to what you think is hate
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i do appreciate the truth of this if you go to the bluepill subreddit the people are vicious in quite a snide way redpill men are not human they are evil and should be burned according to them i mean at the same time trp is filled with hatred of women and disdain for anyone outside the movement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i assume that why some people bill themselves as anti red pill instead of blue pill so as not to endorse the more nasty elements of the sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is the thing with hatefull ideologies or groups they allways think that the target of their hate deserves it ps i dont read that much trp only the threads that get linked to from here in ppd but i have never seen any of them advocate rape links or dont throw around serious accusations like that without proof
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they call themselves that as cover so they can get their hate on without being called a hate sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when i used to post there i would see a totaly serious angry and hatefull post and tell the person hay not cool then get downvoted into oblivion as people would pile on and support the hatefull person that is why i dont post there anymore while there is some legitimate satire there most of it has a undercurrent of resentment and hate for the outgroup what i find more funny is how they believe that empathy is one of the most important values yet show none of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,politics isnt just about elections its about society and wanting to ensure a certain belief system does not become mainstream is a political objective i have no idea why people were so insecure as to downvote me i never said that was a bad thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its kinda like being rude and snide to the klu klux klan or skinheads sometimes people deserve to be called out on their hate in a rude way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yet youll notice tbp hasnt created a subreddit against extreme feminism which is probably more pervasive in actual society than trp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope i personally took my flair from the ppd wiki totally unrelated to the sub im not the only one always helpful to ask what a persons beliefs are rather than just assume their position
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that is the thing with hatefull ideologies or groups they allways think that the target of their hate deserves it ignoring the typos what youre saying sound insightful but really doesnt apply to this situation at all this isnt bigotry trp advocates emotional manipulation and abuse
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes theyre literally talking about people who think rape should be legal i think people who think rape should be legal are disgusting too is that hate now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you actually believe a bunch of guys who struggle getting laid can be compared with people who would kill black and jewish people in their millions youre so far beyond any hope you have probably become the hateful one because of your ability to dehumanise others
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats like saying you cant address homophobia until racism is gone there are plenty of people hating on extreme feminism whats wrong with branching out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tbp advocates abuse practices it on the regular and even goes so far as to talk gleefully about prison rape and death to those in the outgroup everyone needs someone to look down on somone to feel justified in hating to feel better about themselves tbp found that in the complaints of low value males perfect group to hate who is going to defend them that way we can feel smug and superior while putting them down punching down is fun mirite
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wrong they are taking something that one person said and using it to denigrate all unattractive people put down all people that cant get laid etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the comparison isnt so hard when you look and see what exactly these people are saying if it were simply about getting laid there wouldnt be so many posts about how men are superior to women or that women are children or that women shouldnt vote heres a few good ones plenty of women are immature children men are superior to women and men need to be in charge of them shit in there women shouldnt vote also calls women backwards retards who crave abuse and despise goodness so dont tell me its all about getting laid because it isnt what it really is is a bunch of sad pathetic manchildren angry that the girl who sat in front of them in math class wont let them sniff her panties and blaming everyone for the fact that theyre a bunch of fucking losers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because tbp seems to be okay with extreme views in women but not extreme views in men i imagine that this is because men are still seen by them as as the more privledged members of society whether that matches reality or not in any case it definitely screams hypocrisy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tbp advocates abuse practices it on the regular and even goes so far as to talk gleefully about prison rape and death to those in the outgroup what the fuck tbp found that in the complaints of low value males no one on tbp even believes low value males are a thing god
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats literally not what they say words have meanings you know you cant just point at someone saying something and then claim they said another thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,none of these things are on the level of genocide and slavery even if i agree theyre bitter and nasty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are loads of men on tbp and most of the nonmen there are in relationships with men were just mocking a small subset of men and women holla rpw who post hilariously obtuse shit on the internet we cant mock everyone who posts dumb shit online that would be overwhelming fortunately theres tia and bestofoutrageculture and others im sure that tackle groups of idiots that fall outside our scope
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,finding one extreme behaviour or attitude more funny than another one is far from hypocrisy its personal preference what pushes their buttons do you believe that for a subreddit to be fair it cant be niche that seems overtly sensitive to me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because tbp seems to be okay with extreme views in women but not extreme views in men why do you think that care to give a few quotes or links because you saying so doesnt make it so tbp doesnt on focus on extreme feminism because thats not what they do you can go to tumblrinaction for that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah trp sucks ass on that front but does that makes what you guys do any better you people do the same thing you are condeming the hypocrisy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one on tbp even believes low value males are a thing god the insults you use beg to differ
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,these people are so disgusting its no wonder they cant get laid for shit and congregate online with other pathetic losers whove never had sex words literaly read them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nazis and white supremacists say a lot of nasty things in addition to being for genocide and slavery its the inequality and hate rhetoric which makes the two movements comparable i also think its no suprise theres a bit of overlap between redpillers and white supremacistsracists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in my own personal experience a lot of the people on the blue pill seem to side more with the people being mocked on tia than against them they also go after people totally detached from trp and just instantly label them misogynists idiots see comments on notch milo yiannopoulos with no further justification for their opposition to perfectly reasonable stances
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is hypocrisy though are all the blue pillers that mock extreme red pill attitudes while having extreme blue pill attitudes of their own that are just as hatefull or demeaning
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,care to explain this sounds more personal than actually related to tbp satire sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes these people and other pathetic losers literally refers to the people in that link who think rape should be legal what do you not understand about that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the only thing bad about neonazis and kkk members is their desire to commit acts of violence i really couldnt care less if they think white people are the master race so long as they keep it to the privacy of their own homes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes they have different opinions than you tbp and tia are different entities with different perspectives but theyre both satirecirclejerk subs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the thing is you are not condeming the ideas of trp i would be fine with that in fact i condem them myself the problem is you are attacking and being really nasty to a whole bunch of people people whose life already dealt a shitty hand to the other issue is you are being hatefull to people that have not done anything just because of what somebody else said
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the you i was talking about was the blue pill sub probably should have worded that better blue pillers use things like sad lonely virgin cant get laid ugly sperg loser as insults and paints the entire group with the words of one or two people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in that link nobody is advocating for making rape legal it is used as an example of a statement that someone could make
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i can see that racism and bigotry isnt something youve had to deal with in your everyday life im sure you would feel differently if it was something that affected you personally
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre not wrong but you talk about everything tbp related with we so claiming that tia is essentially just another part of with the same sort of fundamental ideas as tbp is misleading i fail to see how you can identify with these people who have such ridiculous opinions which you dont hold again more likely to be posted about on tia than post on it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never seen those words used unless they were directed at a specific post that contained disgusting hateful comments directed toward women followed by complaints about hypergamy awalt and why wont women sleep with me thats not painting an entire group thats reacting to actual people i really feel like youre taking tbp personally when its targeted toward specific assholes why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,entj i think mbti is an interesting thing esp in terms of sparking discussion but i certainly dont take it a seriously as some seem to just clicked the link posted by atlas one of the questions when solving a problem you would rather follow a familiar approach than seek a new one those questions bother me theres not enough info there does the old approach work then im happy to use it less effort for me if it doesnt work then obvs id want to try a new one so i just put uncertain as the answer gah seems to be lots of entjs around on the internets more than other etypes is it because we heart arguing edit purple laydee
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,intp blue female fun fact apparently its the least attractive female personality type were supposedly the tomboys who cant be bothered with normal female things like makeup or being social
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im also intp and im purple used to be blue though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i forgot what i am but people going around quoting their types is like people telling one another their sign in the the types always have super fun good qualities it is just an ego boost oh i am intellectual precise and good at problem solving
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ientj red male apparently im intj but am really close to the e
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,intp ive taking this test probably a hundred times before i know what i am by now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,weve done this before here are past responses my own were red beta entj apparently i am intp and identify as purple i am somewhat skeptical of such tests given the complexity of personalities but it seems fairly accurate for me lol that is so typical of an intp from the wishywashy purple label down to the distrust of models that seem way too simple for your tastes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,entj i have my doubts about the accuracy of this very short and selfadministered quiz
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,isfj but my s and f are both weak blue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont believe mbti is scientifically valid but thats probably because im an infp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am an intj i dont know where i fall on the bluered spectrum i suppose i am redleaning but when bpers are wrong they are wrong in a more reasonable way when rpers are wrong they are spectacularly wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,entp the entpest neither pill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i used to be intp but forcibly changed my personality because i was tired of being unattractive to men i think intp is the worst personality to have as a girl ive never met a young guy who likes the intp personality in women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,intj male red would be actually interesting to make a map of ppd on this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nother intp purplish woman mbti is fun i think that my intpness makes it so that i am able to keep an open mind and inquisitive attitude towards red pill ideas without swallowing them wholesale facts be damned on another note its funny to see other people in this thread talking about intp being an unattractive type in women ive always thought that my personality was a bit of a man repellant glad its not just me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,remember kids mbti has categories so its more scientifically valid than horoscopes doesnt look good for alphabeta though mbti is bullshit but kind of addictive so lets go ive always scored entj and im resoundingly blue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i prefer
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,entp makes sense i enjoy the process of arguing but rarely feel too emotionally invested in the actual subject
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,infp unsure if i am blue or purple
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,op just curious do you get into conspiracy theories too i think thats another intp thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,blue pill intp woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have always been a cusp intjp strongly int but every test i have ever taken has me around jp take your pick i guess man blue pill as fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah intp male purple here apparently its typical
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it seems to vary a little by testing site but this time infja nonred
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,intj like most of the internet purple
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im enfp bluish grey in terms of pill color the meyersbriggs is fun to think about but i second highogs criticisms personally i prefer the httpsenwikipediaorgwikibigfivepersonalitytraits in contrast to the myersbriggs which was developed based on jungian theory with no initial grounding in data the big five was developed from the bottom up taking a lexical approach basically they applied factor analysis to various human languages seeing how words that described personality traits clustered in terms of synonyms and antonyms and then putting names to those clusters the words that were best correlated to one another gregarious and shy for example which have a strong negative correlation would fall into the same cluster in this case extroversion for those who cant be fucked clicking the hyperlink to wikipedia the big five traits are as follows opennesstoexperiences conscientiousness extroversion agreeableness and neuroticism im extremely high o low c mediumtohigh e high a and high n furthermore unlike my myersbriggs type this big five profile doesnt vary much no mater which bigfivebased personality test i take i just learned about a newer personality model also based on lexical analysis rp folks should like this one especially since it better accommodates the idea of a dark triad the httpsenwikipediaorgwikihexacomodelofpersonalitystructure is pretty much same as the big five but with an honestyhumility dimension thrown in according to httphexacoorghexacoonline im high in honestyhumility tis sad no dark triad for me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,intj purple red
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,just retook the test still intj still male still red
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im a blue pill male and test as either infp or infj though im told that i come across as more infp i can see traits of both in myself im obsessively orderly when it comes to my environment and do plan methodically but very much a dreamer and a what if type internally so it could be that my internal landscape and thought processes are more xxxp and ive adapted my practical approach to life to be more xxxj
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,estj but the t is borderline i test as esfj during shark week with the f being borderline too im red like a crimsoncandy apple red
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,intj woman blue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,entp and purple i think being a p would draw one to purpleness as opposed to being stuck in an rp or bp mindset
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,intp female blue pill red pill descriptions of how women act and think do not describe me or the majority of women i know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,infj female i identify as pink pill but that would fall under purple pill if i have to pick out of the categories given in the title
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres the personality is binary traits reddit circlejerk again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,those questions bother me theres not enough info there does the old approach work then im happy to use it less effort for me if it doesnt work then obvs id want to try a new one so i just put uncertain as the answer gah i hear ya ive always been a bad test taker personality tests included for this very reason thats why i recommend that anyone with a serious interest in personality systems just scrap the tests and focus on the system itself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats very interesting i have a lot of respect and attraction for women who dont wear makeup yet are naturally attractive and fit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my bf is an intp
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i still struggle with the social thing but ive learned that i can get away with putting exactly things on my face in terms of makeup
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sounds about right also i think the intp personality type itself can be polarizing people tend to be either really into me as a person or completely repulsed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,male or female
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,xntj crew checking in whats up bro
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you an amateur radio operator not many people use cq at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,red purple or blue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol that is so typical of an intp from the wishywashy purple label down to the distrust of models that seem way too simple for your tastes shit youve just made me realize that every comment ive posted on the ppd can be prefaced with as someone high in perceiving rather than judging i mean maybe instead of continuously typing out the phrase i suspect its more nuanced than that in response to every fucking cmv i could just type the letter p as a shorthand or maybe i could just get the mods to post a sticky entitled hakosua says its more complicated you think it is then i could delete my account and go home learn spanish in my free time or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes this also explains why i am simultaneously concerned about global warming yet remain very skeptical of the models and long term projections
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im estj too but hardcore blue
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you will find more t types are okay with rp than f types misogyny is bad yo every f type ever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,like my bf
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,enfp and i prefer big hexaco to mbti maybe thats why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when rpers are wrong they are spectacularly wrong personally its not my color i just hate to halfass anything so if im wrong im gonna be really freaking wrong and then probably take the next months to contemplate where i went so off the rails lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a male intp i would like to meet an intp woman its probably a rare match though i suspect intp women have to chase after them a bit more than theyre comfortable with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what specifically about the intp personality do you think is so unattractive to men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think that one would be the entp it basically thinks like a man speaking in stereotypes and often feels disconnected from its female side is logical sometimes selfish and socially dominant contrarian argumentative at the core i wrote a post to rentp on this some time ago and many seemed to relate arguably though the entp is not as introvertedly stubborn in being their true self around everyone so they camouflage better into conformity what in your opinion are the unattractive intp characteristics on a female
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed i think there is much to learn here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i see nothing wrong with intp women was an interesting thread about an intp woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this test says i am an enfj
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,still an intj although my percentages are a bit different on this particular test they are all still high
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes its fun do you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,two purple two blue intp so far
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it said i was infpt which i dont entirely agree with the whole thing is kind of silly anyway i am pretty strongly blue but can occasionally lean purple
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same type and pill view here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wow thanks for such a thorough response i will check out that stuff soon and report backas a fellow enfp also i am purple pill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wtf im also enfp and prefer big too also high for honestyhumility openness extroversion agreeableness low for neuroticism and conscientiousness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why the quarantine waiting for your mr alpha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,spoken like a true xntp dont treat it as scientific just treat it as an infodense set of adjectives the online tests arent reliable enough ofc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your criticism is duely noted but i was surprised how well it describes certain aspects of why i do what i do on here especially
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,one useful frame work for viewing the world among many such frameworks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think the reason it endured is because its usually accurate horoscopes on the other hand are ignored by most people or thought of as a bit of fun
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont understand mbti and dont care to easy to criticize when it doesnt make sense to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well idk about attractive but ive always been really competitively into sports it was the only way i was really comfortable socializing the makeup thing is i guess partly laziness and not seeing the point my timeeffort seems better spent elsewhere and also just not making sense to me like why would i want to attract someone who doesnt even know what my face really looks like
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,makes sense that youd date someone of the best type
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i used to play around with makeup a lot but for the past few years ive gotten lazy and also narrowed down what i use to things and usually just one foundation so much easierquicker
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive played around with it maybe ill find something im comfortable with someday soon
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people actually appear to mostly like me i come across as completely nonthreatening awkward and innocent then when i do open up enough to reveal what im actually thinking people seem to find it hilarious and charming if anything i seem to have a harder time liking them than the reverse
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,female
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mrrh mucking it through the holidays meditating on rp you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,working on my technicians license
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am blue pill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im glad i could save you time hakosua spanish sounds like a useful language going forward i for one will remember your pness next time i forget to consider nuance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the mind of a scientist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mostly because f types dont handicap ourselves when it comes to making connections the way t types do you guys get ridiculously irrational on social intuitionempathy issues then try desperately to rationalize the illogic that makes it possible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats cool its a pretty rare type for a guy i think i bet hes a sweetheart
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre a sensible rper most on ppd are but we get a few idiots here as well imho
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,makes sense i figured xxfx httptypelogiccomenfjhtml
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i find them addicting i think it satisfies that part of our brain that needs to find patterns as well as appealing to the part unsatisfied with straight answers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well yeah the same effect can be achieved by adjectives if i told you i was a relatively smart guy you could assume i had higher than avg gpa in hs and college and higher than avg sat gre despite imperfect correlation i guess the word smart also has some descriptive quality to it like the mbti model what if i told you i was beta youd probably be able to make minor safe assumptions about me like that ive never been to prison when you tell someone honestly that youre xxtx youre essentially telling them that you put your thoughts first before your feelings surely if youre to be trusted they could make some assumptions about your personality or behaviour from that albeit minimal could they not that being said i think the online tests used for mbti modeling could probably use some work hell i could have probably pinpointed you out as intp after getting to know you for a while
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because its based on cognitive processes which is how you like to think change the order of the cognitive processes you use and repress and you effectively change your mbti type
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and i think its criticised because people dont like the idea that they genuinely are not actually that unique and really can be sorted into little boxes fairly well most of the time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you really dont feel her argument has any merit i think mbti is fun and can be useful but shes raised some good points it doesnt seem as simple to me as must not make sense to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why indeed a relationship built on initial falsehood has a weak foundation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,interesting would you tell me more about why youre purple
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,finishing up my last day of work before i take a bit of vacation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nice glad to see people are still joining the hobby and yet again ousting myself as having nerd tendencies ive had my ticket since but i havent been active in over years a buddy of mine just got his general and hes causing me to get the itch again by telling me about all the digital modes available now thing is i need to get my general for most of that and im lazy as hell p edit to add fwiw if you have the ambition study for your general now as well if you pass the tech you can then just go right on to general and general gets you most of the good stuff now that theyve trimmed down the license classes not sure what youre looking to get into but hf has most of the long distance action while vhfuhf has a lot of really cool local stuff im amazed at the recent integration of vhfufh repeaters and the internet amazing stuff but i really want to do long distance digital satellite some of which you can do as a tech and if i ever have the space and the money moon bounce and meteor scatter digital
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,aw bless thank you i will attempt to harness your tjness so as to master the rules governing spanish verb conjugations or maybe the redness is more useful if im alpha enough i can just speak bad spanish without giving a fuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,apparently not among the scientific consensus though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mostly because f types dont handicap ourselves when it comes to making connections the way t types do i dont honestly know if i know what a true emotional connection feels like my connections with other humans are logical my empathy is logical i use intuition to fuel my logic so i still utilize my human feeling engine through intuition feelings otherwise are things animals express becausethey dont have full bodily control you guys get ridiculously irrational on social intuitionempathy issues then try desperately to rationalize the illogic that makes it possible you mean hamster just say hamster bro so much easier not all of trp is t type plenty of f type on there hell some f types make better ladies men naturally
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mostly because f types dont handicap ourselves when it comes to making connections the way t types do you call it a handicap i call it a filter of course being intj i dont want or need many friends so to be honest i tend to walk around looking a bit unapproachable on purpose because i actually dont want to chat up randos
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he is i definitely need to work to match up to his goodness level lmao
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i browse rconspiracy often but my intp doesnt have much respect for their intelligence for the most part one of the big conspiracies i postulated during the election was that the polls were wrong and it was either selfselected pollster bias or coordinated conspiracy so i dug deep into the numbers to identify patterns of falsehood i reached my conclusion and bet heavily online for trump to win in pennsylvania very happy with my profit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i suspect some people have difficulty answering the questions honestly and accurately
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is that how one becomes alpha
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,excellent article thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep and i think its confronting to people to know that there will never come a time when everyone thinks the way they do different groups of people will always approach the same issue from different directions and weve needed that diversity to survive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mehhhh that depends for some people that may be the case but for others knowing that there are other people like them may make them feel like less of a freak
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not really the dsm v isnt scientifically valid either doesnt mean anything most good tests give you a scale not just on side or another you can see yourself change saying the tests can give you different results taking it not long after is also meaningless someone can be borderline on a trait or they behave differently because of their current mindsetlike being stressed out vs not being in a more emotional mood vs not the criticisms come from lack of understanding the best criticism against mbti is that there are more cognitive processes than whats represented by the letters and one from personalities which just means theres more work to be done it doesnt make the current system invalid by any means and its remarkable useful and descriptiveespecially if you get the whole scale like what percent t vs f for example
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah it feels like a lie
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,started hanging out in the irc red pill looks like a different thing when its separated from the angry team man moralizers in the sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i prefer pness as it makes for better puns or maybe the redness is more useful if im alpha enough i can just speak bad spanish without giving a fuck mitigated speech is a sign of weakness anyway so is legibility dont be a teenager be someone more influential like a senator
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are aware that number is bs right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont honestly know if i know what a true emotional connection feels like think of it as a drug dealerjunkie dynamic except youre both in an infinite ouroborus loop you are each others pleasant buzzridiculous high theres also a thing where your identities merge slightly which is why subcultures can form simply based on similar likes obviously deeper connections intensify that effect of course there are risks to all of this but theyre pretty obvious around these parts i cant imagine life without this happening the instant i meet anyone theres at least a small connection and unless theyre an immediate danger to those i care about i usually try to help them in any way i can
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i tried that and became more popular than ever p the only thing that seems to actually work is to try to look like i have no idea what a social skills are even then some people dont take the hint if the conversation they overhear is interesting enough whats your secret
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it sounds like youre a lot smarter about it than i am i am prone to letting my imagination run wild with an idea buying into it completely at first in order to fully explore it i couldnt sleep for days when youknowwhatgate evidence kept coming out from the wikileaks emails
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a potential problem for any model dishonest people who feel ashamed about their own personalities or feel like they need cooler adjectives for themselves this can be a problem even for more scientifically credible models like the big which admittedly is more orthogonal than mbti model from what ive read myself thats mostly not the models fault the word smart doesnt lose validity or meaning just because people lie about how smart they are on the internet
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,an alpha can be of nearly any personality type but some mbti types are more conducive to being more alpha than others mbti will better determine if youre more masculine or more feminine than make you alpha or beta types that rely heavily on feeling and intuition and repress thinking are more feminine than ones that rely on thinking and facts and repressing feelings for example xsfj is like a basic bitch xstj is like a basic dude alpha behavior comes more from mindset and beliefs than what cognitive processes you use first
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i am an intj fyi i didnt answer elsewhere
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and those are the people who like categorisation systems like mbti thats what im saying
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im no expert but im intrigued by her point that so many people get different results even weeks after taking the test your explanation that its because someone might be a different mood or mindset isnt very satisfying to me tbh i think its most likely that your results are consistent and have meaning for you while she hasnt had this same experience i think its great that youve found it very useful but i know others who dont feel the same way im not sure you can say its objectively useful or descriptive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why isnt dsm scientifically valid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats interesting and it seems fairly balanced it echoesconfirms some of highogs concerns
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,anyone who uses makeup gets the i want to see the real you speech nobody seems to understand that using the makeup is something we just do for ourselves think of it as just using your face as a canvas for your art if youre really into someone one of the most romantic parts is seeing what they look like when they just wokeup anyways
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,very true
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,curious why youd do that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpimgsxkcdcomcomicswritingstylespng title writing styles titletext i liked the idea suggested by on bashorg of a twitter bot that messages prominent politicians to tell them when theyve unnecessarily used smsspeak abbreviations despite having plenty of characters left stats this comic has been referenced times representing of referenced xkcds httpswwwxkcdcom httpswwwredditcomrxkcd httpswwwredditcomrxkcdtranscriber httpxkcdrefinfostatistics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,think of it as a drug dealerjunkie dynamic is this your attempt at trying to sell emotional connections as a good thing lmao
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have the male equivalent of resting bitch face ive been told i look pissed off when im simply not expressing any emotion on my face add to it im and not exactly scrawny dont take that to mean rippedcut im just thick in general and most people steer clear of me on their own not as much in the office as when im out in private life i have to dress accordingly for work and occasionally someone will chat me up because business casual with security guards seems to be enough to bolster their confidence for real it took me years to figure it out but i look rather unapproachable in day to day life but as you point out once someone gets to know me in most cases i cant get rid of them i tend to think im an asshole but in general the folks that love me really freaking love me and the ones that actually meet me and dont they really dont like me so its in my best interests to simply not let many people really know me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh i do that dreaming stuff too but then i have a tendency to get a bit ocd looking for patterns in numbers as well i like to consider were all in the matrix and the implications i like to buy into ufos and such too its intoxicating the wikileaks were amazing stayed up many nights
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ha as a follow up to see myself confirmed when faced with stress overload which may come from being confronted with intense emotions feeling guilt over being critical towards others or not having their strongly held values andor feelings validated entjs may find themselves in the grip of their inferior function introverted feeling i go from repressing my feelings to staring at my feelings when im stressed in such a state or in a more stressed mood if i took an mbti test my result would not be entj probably isfj or something of the like never even read this site before but that is the beauty of schools of thought theyre pretty consistent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how can you possibly understand mbti without understanding the cognitive processes but here this is about stress that i quickly found when i get highly stressed i act emotional as fuckcompared to my normal and not like an entj
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same reason no school of psychology or economics is scientifically proven not enough useful data i think to truly directly prove psychology we would need to be able to observe peoples thoughts otherwise were looking at how things are and creating theories working backwards for why
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i get it my best friend has always enjoyed doing her makeup and explained that she just doesnt feel like herself leaving the house without it i just happen to feel the exact opposite even when i was tiny i absolutely hated the idea of face paint while all the other kids liked it i just feel self conscious and notmyself when i have stuff on my face
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nobody seems to understand that using the makeup is something we just do for ourselves i mean i got started in wearing makeup to look professional but now im just enjoying the different colors and stuff lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,consciously i believe you but i wonder about your subconscious motivations
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why would i hang out in the irc at first out of curiosity then because the people were interesting and debated well now because theyre my friends
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no just a thing but the side effects arent as bad as most addictions and in many ways it can be some of the best medicine around if all goes well if you want sunny optimism youre talking to the wrong guy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have the male equivalent of resting bitch face dammit should have known i have the male equivalent of awww can we adopt it unless i subvert it with probably homeless or totally worships satan its a bit backwards around here dont knock it most people want nothing to do with me beyond polite acknowledgment but some of those who do really hit the gutter running its like how am i supposed to get any understanding of normal between those extremes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive read a few books about aliens and the like and i dont see the harm in entertaining everything as a possibility ive actually been diagnosed with ocd but i dont take any meds i find this stuff to be a good way to sort of exercise my brain til its tired otherwise itll find something else to focus on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if these descriptions didnt resonate with you or seem familiar do you think you would put as much stock in it as you do now
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah it seems pretty common with int types im not sure how to translate it all except that at the higher levels its designed to communicate to other f minds a smoky film noire aesthetic creates an entirely different atmosphere than an innocent apple pie and thats before we even touch subcultures unfortunately if you asked me how it all works i really couldnt tell you the hard sciences seem determined to make it all about sex we went to a bar and charged our tab to the university and while business understands advanced color theory theyre more of a mind to exploit it rather than question it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,now youre talking about neuroaesthetics your belief is that the human brain is only able to engage its reward mechanisms through social interaction if thats true why would anyone ever dress in a complicated aesthetic thats completely unappreciatedrejected by their shitstain of a small town
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,awww
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ill stick to emotional disconnection from people thx sounds like a lot of hassle for no tangible gain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol it takes very little effort on my part to look like the guy that is hating everyone around him with his gaze in fact for many all i have to do is look them in the eye i swear
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah makes perfect sense but when i get into something cool at night i cant stop sometimes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i would how can they not resonante with a human theyre based on how humans think everyone has all cognitive processes described by mbti it necessarily resonantes with someone that understands the meaning
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the same reason you have gothic people in high school its a form of rebellion against a society you disagree with
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i had the option id probably join you how do you do it how do you make connections without anyone getting inside
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats true its more stimulating than anything at times i was not joking about going days on just a few hours of sleep just a couple weeks ago
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure you understand what im asking say you took the test and got isfj but when you read the descriptions none of it sounded like yourself or how you thinkfeelbehave would you still think mbti was useful if you didnt feel it accurately classified you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was a goth in high school it wasnt just the flip of the bird though that was a part of it it was because i found that aesthetic beautiful and being able to reflect it it made me hate myself a little less there was also the part where it was just fun and a creative challenge
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its just how i am im emotionally numb like of the time in the short periods i am emotional i still dont tend to connect with other people just get depressed for a bit then go back to being numb i like it its comfortable emotions are bothersome i cannot even imagine being reliant on another person for my own emotional state yuck
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it says httpwwwpersonalitypagecomintprelhtml intps natural partner is entj but i think thats other personality types trying to force extroversion on us who view it as strange i see no reason why intps should not insist on dating other intps
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it would depend on how self aware and honest i was at that moment but ive had numerous people of all personality types take the test explain what their results mean and have never had a disagreement only and yes only people being excited to see themselves so simply and accurately described the closest to a disagreement comes from people with borderline traits that usually are actively growing and changing themselvesthough some people do remain rather split for life
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,amazing how i hit the nail on the head no fashion is simply a cultural thought virus that spreads and slowly evolves but doesnt drastically change your subconscious is screaming at you through you conscious actions and pleasures
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,except i was consciously aware of all of these things because i studied psychology in grade school and youre arguing for a thought virus when abstract principles of aesthetic are hardwired into the species youre also ignoring my internal reward system in favor of hard hamstering
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not even the women rp attracts are awalt if you define it as behaves like a shitty brat if you define it as feminity then all worthwhile read not the shrews are like that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,edit mods wanted it made clearer that i am disagreeing with the op the disagreement stems from the fact i believe feminists do understand the strength of the male libido but that they misunderstand how men attempt to fulfill those needs the main feminist misconception is about male motives feminists think that men manipulate control and dominate women in order to satisfy their desire for sex and power because they are viewing men through a female lens what really happens is men are driven to care about what women care about in order to attain female companionship men try to amass wealth and power to impress women they built society to better protect and provide for the needs of women men invented romance and chivalry ironically making the same mistake feminists do viewing the opposite sex through the lens of their own experience and coming up with the wrong solution feminists think men want to be in charge but really they want to be whatever will get them laid beta providers prove this point men will give up power easily if they think it is the best path to female companionship
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree with you theres a lot of misconceptions about male sexuality and feminism does a good job of trying to insist its controllable and nonspontaneous which is horseshit but thats about as far as i can agree with you your examples arent really illustrating the idea of spontaneously triggered male sexual arousal but rather impulsivity and lack of selfcontrol that is unattractive in all but the chadliest of chads and even then its questionable at best ive been approached by the odd minority maneven in my incredibly white midwestern cityand not once are their opening lines nice boobs theres some level of physical compliment but its paired with something illustrating what they can offer nice boobs gets you nowhere as a man and as a woman who was not in that moment seeking sexual approval its outofcontext and jarring rather than appreciated since women very rarely want to be just a nice set of boobs its the line of the poorlysocialized and troll and women see through it and dismiss it immediately of the time women rarely approach yeah you do need to be proactive i agree with you there but nice boobs is not a good method of drawing attention to yourself again even those jamaican guys usually make an offering as well you get better luck with it phrased as an invitation not an acknowledgement of sexual approval at the expense of any other quality and why are you leaving comments on a youtube video like nice boobs in pursuit of sex anyways thats not being proactive in seeking a sexual or romantic partner that chick is in backasswoods ukrainistan you wont get sex or love from her youre not doing it to be proactive to compete for shit an attempt at cocky flirting from four thousand miles away is nothing more than a desire to be an asshole on the internet theres no other real or tangible reason there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if im watching a yt video of a girl shredding a guitar and i leave a comment like nice boobs its not because i want to insult her or devalue her as human being or as a musician its because the sight of smooth skin in a well proportioned young female specimen makes me horny its not about objectification its about being appreciative nonsense you know damn well its going to make her feel devalued and objectified and you do it anyway stop kidding yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course you are allowed to feel aroused at the sight of female skin of course youre allowed to compete with men for the women you are most attracted to howeveryoure not an animal you are a man with self control what is the point of leaving nice boobs on a music video its not going to get you the girl all it does it reduce her to a body part keep it to yourself you clearly dont understand what its like to be a woman with talents or intelligence or ambition who is then only reduced to her looks stop overlooking what else we have to offer because you get all hot and bothered when we flash a shoulder
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if im watching a yt video of a girl shredding a guitar and i leave a comment like nice boobs its not because i want to insult her or devalue her as human being or as a musician its because the sight of smooth skin in a well proportioned young female specimen makes me horny so basically you have no selfcontrol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres one problem with this post aside from the slight creep factor of posting nice boobs as a comment on a youtube video ditto the men liking and loving and leaving effervescent obsequious fawning complimentary comments on social media about womens photos photos which are clearly designed to play up a womans sex appeal and garner reactions from her stable of orbiters most of whom will never get a chance even to buy her a drink much less fuck her feminist misconceptions about gender relationships arise not because women dont understand male sexuality they arise because feminists mistakenly believe that sexuality attraction sexual responses etc both male and female are fluid and malleable and can be changed they believe mens sexual responses can be changed men can be made to be attracted to fat women ugly women and ballbusting bitches men can be made to offer commitment gladly and willingly to sluts who have proven themselves wholly unworthy of commitment they believe this because they believe sexuality is a social construct and that no part of it is biologically driven feminist theory also tried to talk us into women are attracted to nice kind men who do dishes and fold laundry and nurse babies and are stay at home dads they tell us these are sexually attractive qualities in men again they claim sexuality and attraction cues can be conditioned and changed they continue to insist on it despite the mounting evidence to the contrary feminists very well understand what men and women are attracted to its that feminists believe this can be altered based on existing social conditions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,dudeno im willing to stretch into red or blue territory to find common ground with people in these debates but youre way off the mark the worst part of all this is your nice boobs comment defense by your logic sexual harassment should be okay right youre just appreciating a woman right wrong please stop doing this its creepy as hell another part where i disagree is your insistence that women cant understand how men crave sex im a little frustrated that people still feel this way but let me just remind you women really really like sex they like hot barely dressed guys they watch porn some of them like you will even write lewd messages online to hot guys in videos for the record i think thats gross and creepy as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are no misconceptions of male sexuality we see it everyday its hoisted upon us in the same way most religious people fear gay people will hoist their lifestyle upon them we get it you like boobs and butts we cant escape it because there are pictures and media of scantily clad women at every corner you like sex cool nothing wrong with that the issue arises when you cant seem to keep it to yourself men are really bad at keeping their mouths shut when it comes to their sexual urges if nobody asked for your opinion then you have no reason to voice it what you see as a misconception is just plain irritation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im starting to understand your point women dont understand your sexuality because you come across as off putting and essentially a gigantic turn off
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,creep factor in this post is a steady youre making guys sound like drooling dogs with our dicks constantly in our hands a big part of the transition into manhood is learning self control you might want to look into that and that is a big part of the backlash of this weak ass boys will be boys defense of bad behavior most of the laws regarding sexual harassment revolve around people needing to act like adults and control their behavior when in a public or professional setting the idea that all this horniness is outside your control is total bullshit stop running around like a teenage boy trying to lose his virginity and start acting like a grown up the rest of your post is just plain old sexism men hold the majority of wealth because theyre super competitive no way it could be because for centuries men have controlled every aspect of society and engineered it so that the wealth flowed into their hands hell for most of the history of this country women werent even allowed to vote cmon these are some very weak arguments even for red pill
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when you say girl shredding a guitar i picture someone with long loose hair and and smokey eyes who doesnt give a shit shes not just sexy shes interesting and talented when you say nice tits i picture a little girl in pigtails with her shirt up grinning because holy shit shes popular now both girls are sexy but only the former girl is valued for something beyond sex appeal learn to talk about women whom you like in ways that make those women feel sexy not because women deserve it or because feminists tell you to or because its somehow the right thing to do do it because thats how communication works if you find a girl sexy make her feel sexy nice tits wont make random women feel sexy save that line for kinky sexually submissive girls or coeds on the beach slumming for mardigras beeds horniness is just like any other emotion you cant wish it away and its exhausting to ignore it constantly but as the captain of your ship you cant just fuck off and put a feeling in charge let horniness inform your decisions not dictate them its that subtle distinction between posting useless nonsense like nice tits and calculated compliments like do you play with a band that last riff was insane i gotta hear it played live
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women in general do not understand male sexuality the male gaze is tantamount to rape to feminists as well but they just dont get it they believe we are out to harm women when what we want to do is have sex sex is a pleasurable and intimate act women use our desires against us by manipulating men feminists think it is ok to manipulate men using sex but not ok for men to do the same they are projecting their insecurities because to a woman sex isnt just sex to her it is something she can use to her advantage or to control someone it is no wonder they freak out when men desire sex because they think men want to control them as they would want to control men it is also hard work because not every woman has enough natural sex appeal so she needs to put effort into her appearance this is in the hopes of snagging chad but what they complain about is when men they find ubdesirable show them attention at best they get beta orbiters at worst they have creepy guys after them still they have legal power to make that creep stop trying to get their attention it is the cost of being attractive furthermore they dont want to cheapen sex when they get freebies from men even men they dont intend to sleep with conversely for a guy he sees some traits on a woman he likes her and he wants to prove himself so he can get naked with her it really is that simple but everything men like sexually casual sex porn preferring fitter women is demonised as shallow unhealthy immoral or misogynistic women dont get the equivalent criticism and most of them are quite shallow if she likes powerful men who are well built she has high standards and is an empowered woman if he likes feminine women who hut the gym he is shallow men always adapt or try to adapt to what women want to earn their favour and get laid women just have to make sure they are not grossly overweight and someone will show interest really beautiful women who know how to be sexy have far more control over more men than men do women women are scared that if mens sexuality was allowed to be expressed more instead of shunned or charged for profit women would lose their power this fear has culminated in modern day feminism and an attack on masculinity and male sexuality
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women for the most part have zero appreciation for just how strong and allencompassing the male libido is its always there and it affects just about every aspect of our daytoday life the fact that i may be with a ltr and not out trying to bang every young thing that looks my way is a testament to my devotion to my ltr i have foregone a lot of lifes freedoms to be with her and the biggest freedom is the ability to bang a lot of different women that is huge ive never known a woman to appreciate that fully they may go as far as to say us men are sexcrazed neanderthals and all we want is sex and theyre pretty much right on the money but discount the whole aspect of me setting that impulse aside for love and the romantic monogamous relationship with that being said making quick and kneejerk comments to a woman on her physical attributes is sad it shows you have lost control over that impulse and feel that she needs to know that information right that minute why you have just put yourself below her on the social ladder youre so hot i have to tell you i cant help myself ugh loser you can get a lot more with a smile and a wink you can get a lot more by just approaching and giving her a genuine compliment and asking for her number oh shes on the internet and you made a comment jesus get a grip son thats lower than low
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not really sure what your point is of course for the most part heterosexual men and lesbian women i assume are attracted to attractive scantily clad women equally heterosexual women and gay men tend to enjoy the sight of attractive men in similarly revealing outfits though the standards for what is revealing are different how does that change anything also f im watching a yt video of a girl shredding a guitar and i leave a comment like nice boobs its not because i want to insult her or devalue her as human being or as a musician its because the sight of smooth skin in a well proportioned young female specimen makes me horny you cant seriously say you arent devaluing someone and then refer to them as a specimen they dont realize that women rarely come up to you for sexualromantic purposes who doesnt realise this thats how dating in our society works whether or not its the way things should be thats the fundamental reasons why men generally have a higher level of competitivity at least when it comes to career and work and thats the reason why men will always be at the top of the social pyramid holding a disproportionate share of wealth citation needed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there might be crazy feminists that find everything offensive and objectifying i wont deny that but putting them aside there are different intensity levels of desire and different forms to approach women guy to his friends look at that girl shes hot shes got nice boobs guy to a woman you look beautiful today guy to a woman damn babe look at that ass see the difference it doesnt take a genius to understand that the last guy is simply disrespectful and biology cant be used to argue in his favor unless hes also intellectually impaired men are not dogs and sexual desire is nowhere near that uncontrollable otherwise rape stats would be at a rate moreover sexual desire is not only a male thing women also can appreciate nice abs shoulders and a good face theres nothing i love more than watching cute guys with nice athletic bodies but i dont go around catcalling them or grabbing their body
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how old are you asking mainly because of your point number
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i leave a comment like nice boobs its not because i want to insult her or devalue her as human being or as a musician its because the sight of smooth skin in a well proportioned young female specimen makes me horny we all men and women think things including sexual things about others peoples bodies however those of us with maturity and restraint refrain from making commentsgestures that might make others uncomfortable since many people find sexual advances from strangers to be uncomfortable then its best not to make advances until you know the person better basically its about not behaving like a wild animal and knowing when it isisnt appropriate to express your sexuality they dont realize that women rarely come up to you for sexualromantic purposes and when they do its often because they realize they are close to their expiration date and they need a provider bullshit maybe they dont approach redpillers for obvious reasons but women are not nuns i can only speak for myself here but i am short ugly and an allaround disagreeable human being and i still manage to get attention from women sometimes unwanted attention like from married college professors perhaps its the fact that im a fine arts student and girls in the arts tend to be moreuhhforward but then again if youre hanging out in places where everyone is sexually repressed then complaining that youre not getting laid thats on you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nice boobs what would you say to the same woman who has the same talent but is not physically appealing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this seems to be an agreement with the op not a disagreement ive removed it for the moment but if you can make your challenge to the ops view more clear id be happy to reapprove it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men did not create societies humanities achievements just for women said it on trp say here again women arent here to reap the rewards of the activities of men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chadliest of chads haha stealng that phrase for later agreed about nice boobs or nice tits we laugh about it as a joke specifically because its such a bad opener for of men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nice tits
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one cares about how you did or what you think except women can and do get complimented for even belowaverage skillsideas because thirsty men think flattery will win her over
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its kinda the opposite really if youre an attractive man you can produce shitty music and women will love it more than it deserves for examples see justin bieber and especially kane brown
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,op imagine if you spent hours learning how to play guitar women spend countless hours on their appearance too why would they feel offended when a man compliments them on this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is the point of leaving nice boobs on a music video its not going to get you the girl all it does it reduce her to a body part keep it to yourself i also dont see the point in making such a comment however the it reduces her to a body part logic doesnt make sense to me if i commented nice shoes or nice microphone then we wouldnt say that were reducing her to her shoes or microphone its generally only when its sexual that we say that mentioning something is reducing them to that thing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well not every woman is insecure about her intelligence and accomplishments and actually appreciates compliments about her appearance sometimes so why should everyone do what you say and ignore the desires of those types of women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually we are animals theres a reason people get addicted to smoking drinking drugs fast food gambling the difference is men are much more predisposed to get addicted to women than vice versa its not about self control men just have a much much more powerful drive to seek women romantically and coitally if women had such better self control they wouldnt have higher relapse rates quitting smoking drinking and drugs than men do and so many of them wouldnt have shopping addictions when people imply that women have better self control its just the women are wonderful effect talking i reiterate we are animals theres a reason our mating patterns are so similar to lower primates
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jesus fucking christ ill never understand why women bitch about men complementing them on their looks as if you saying omg dont objectify women is going to somehow stop billions of men from objectifying women take it as a complement and move on
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you clearly dont understand what its like to be a woman with talents or intelligence or ambition who is then only reduced to her looks understand why rgonewild is more popular with men than rtalentedambitionssmartwomen
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,congrats on having talent you dont understand that men dont care about that proving the op which is because you were raised to believe that talent and ambition are things women should strive for youre now proud of having the things youve worked hard for feminism lies to women just as much as it lies to men instead of focusing on your talent you should have spent more time focusing on starting a family you would have been happier sorry you were misled but you cant fix it now men dont care about talent they care if you can make and take care of babies
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or he just likes triggering sjws
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it was hypotethical i seldom leave those kind of comments
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you hit on a good point both genders are guilty of sexual solipsism men are visually turned on and think things like dick pics will work on women they fail to realize that womens sexuality is largely mental similarly to your point here feminist misconceptions about gender relationships arise not because women dont understand male sexuality they arise because feminists mistakenly believe that sexuality attraction sexual responses etc both male and female are fluid and malleable and can be changed our sexualities can be malleable in a way a straight mans just isnt just look at how the ideal male body went from jacked gorilla in the to the otter body of today we discount how visual men are and think that their sexuality can be negotiated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well said i dont agree but thats a really good point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they do they think they can socially engineer away bad dangerous things they dislike about humanity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women like some hot barely dressed guys but nowhere near the percentage of men if thats the case for you then you are an outlier
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it sends a message that you didnt even watch the video to appreciate the hard work put into playing an instrument you just watched it to get your rocks off which is super fucking insulting to an artist doesnt matter what you intended thats what the message is also refering to a human being as specimen is very obviously objectifying and in bad taste and if im like nice playing and nice boobs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hell for most of the history of this country women werent even allowed to vote yes i forgot that male universal suffrage dates back to the year millions bc no way it could be because for centuries men have controlled every aspect of society and engineered it so that the wealth flowed into their hands males are more competitive its a constant in the animal kingdom if you think humans are radically different than you are delusional
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,who doesnt realise this thats how dating in our society works whether or not its the way things should be i dont think women fully realize how it is and all the implications of it thats the fundamental reasons why men generally have a higher level of competitivity at least when it comes to career and work and thats the reason why men will always be at the top of the social pyramid holding a disproportionate share of wealth citation needed are you asking me to prove my assertion that men compete to get women it might not be the only reason but its one of the most important or do you believe that men want to be rich to buy themselves a giant vault like uncle scrooge and swim in a pool of gold coins
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lesbian women and bisexual women are not as easily approached by girls either but you dont see them resorting to the same level of competitiveness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it doesnt take a genius to understand that the last guy is simply disrespectful que that is not an inherently disrespectful statement most women love to hear that statement from their husbands for example being carnally desired is widely considered a massive turnon for most women especially from someone with whom they want to have lots of hot monkey sex whether it is disrespectful or not is entirely contextual in the right context ive said similar things to women i barely know and gotten laid because of it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,guy to a woman damn babe look at that ass it doesnt take a genius to understand that the last guy is simply disrespectful really have a look at this title many of these women seem to enjoy it now i understand some women would find it disrespectful but to assert as you do that its factually disrespectful is incorrect clearly many of these things are subjective
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this has to be one of the creepiest posts ive seen on this subreddit
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if im watching a yt video of a girl shredding a guitar and i leave a comment like nice boobs its not because i want to insult her or devalue her as human being or as a musician its because the sight of smooth skin in a well proportioned young female specimen makes me horny its not about objectification its about being appreciative youre really making one of your main points feminists just dont get that i cant see a girl without making some kind of comment about her physical appearance regardless of what shes doing or anything else about her seconded this post is creepy no one cares if youre horny or if you believe youre showing appreciation by reducing someone to a set of body parts that you find desirable which is what youre doing whether you claim you want to or not no one is obligated to consider why youre being rude if youre being rude go comment on porn videos designated for that kind of thing in a community of other people who will do the same thing if you really cant control yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a man im tired of the thats just how men are argument as someone else put in were not animals having desire is fine and all but that doesnt change that we are thinking human beings with willpower its no excuse for example of taking the time to type out a non sequitur on some girls video about her body when her body is not the topic of the video that is your con oohs decision to potentially annoy another human being with something any reasonable person can expect is more likely to be taken poorly or ignored rather than positively we arent animals he people who make this argument are jus looking for ways to abdicate responsibility for their own actions or otherwise justify unsavory behaviors
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,feminists dont have a leader calling all the shots republicans contradict themselves so do christians and so do liberals every large group does
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the disagreement stems from the fact i believe feminists do understand the strength of the male libido but that they misunderstand how men attempt to fulfill those needs should i put that in the post or is that explanation okay
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not sure i understand your point can you make it more clear please
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i disagree i think most high achieving betas did it for the pussy
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think what youre saying is true for a lot of guys but youre kidding yourself if you dont realize that there are many many men who do manipulate control and dominate women in order to satisfy their desire for sex and power chicken or the egg conundrum is effort to manipulate and dominate innate or is it learned due to its success rate regardless these men are still a minority and i would consider them outliers as a whole i would say manipulation and selfabsorption are innate traits in women that directly correlate to evolutionary survival the same goes for the desires to protect and sacrifice for women that exist in men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there you go with those weird comments again
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats exactly their point that guys will say whatever they think will flatter her they dont really give a damn about her guitar skills or lack thereof which is extremely frustrating if she wants actual feedback about her performance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,same thing happens to male celebrities see my comment response
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,kesha tswift and miley cyrus exist as counter examples it all depends on how you market yourself year olds listen to anything that makes them feel cool
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some women do spend hours on their makeupz but many women dont and a nice tits is different than a hey your beautiful and a wow i like you eyeliner
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is this even relatable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know if a woman is playing the guitar and your only comment is nice microphone i would still consider that a reduction of her performance and talents its dismissive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,complimenting shoes or microphone is complimenting her choice or taste in something that is vastly better than commenting on a body part
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because its irrelevant to the context of the video and kind of rude nice mic is at least in vague reference to her music but why would we treat the comment nice boobs any different online than irl can you imagine how well that comment would come across to say a street performer afterall you dont often hear people say to male street performers nice cock or shut up and show us your abs yet its supposed to be a neutral comment or even a compliment online so its two things one that its a rude comment to make in the first place and two that its the kind of comment that mainly plagues women and is meant to put her in her place as a sex object rather than a respected artist for example its depressingly common for women who put themselves in the public eye
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,even women who appreciate compliments about their appearance would probably prefer not to receive disrespectful compliments unsolicited and out of context i have yet to meet a single woman online or in real life who would appreciate a random stranger telling them nice tits out of the blue even if he looked like brad pitt in certain specific contexts it might be appropriate if shes posting in rgonewild and showing off her breasts for example but even then nice tits is only one or two steps up from grunting and gesturing towards your crotch
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,actually according to the nida its men who are more likely to relapse
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so why is the guy even watching a video of the girl playing guitar if he doesnt care about her talent theres plenty of porn out there
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i would think you need to get out in reality more often
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you flash that shoulder precisely because you want us to be hot and bothered whether you consciously realize this or notthe famous i only dress up to feel good nonsense yes because you are biologically preprogrammed to feel good about looking attractive to males so no you dont do it for yourself this is a misunderstanding of biologypsychology just because women may have been biologically preprogrammed to feeling good about looking good because it made her more attractive and gain access to morebetter males doesnt mean that these women subconsciously want men to be hot and bothered an organism can behave in a way that attracts morebetter mates without intending to attract mates even on a subconscious level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,see thats the thing it doesnt as a compliment its rude lazy and dismissive as an attempt at trolling its boring lazy and uninspired
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so you only sometimes have no self control
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women understand male sexuality very well men dont understand womens sexuality well at all mostly because men arent taught about it i dont think the ideal male body is all that different whether youre talking about jacked gorilla or otter body its still more or less the same masculine facial features low set brow deep set eyes lantern jaw pronounced jaw line vshaped torso with taper from shoulders to waist and muscular definition its pretty much the same really it just appears to have changed a bit because so few men have those characteristics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also if male sexuality isnt malleable at all why all the gay sex in prisons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,think things like dick pics will work on women to be fair there are some women for whom dick pics work apparently ive never been sexually interested in those kinds of women no offense to them im friends with a couple of women who are like that but they exist in general i think dick pics are just ultracringey for almost everyone but im one of those guys who doesnt really like vag pics either so
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i disagree with the ideal mens bodies comment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,look around you look at the audience for shades of grey magic mike etc even movies not directly marketed to women are getting in one the game jurassic world and guardians of the galaxyplenty of gratuitous half naked chris pratt in the avengers its not black widow that loses her shirt its ironman and captain america look at any movie with zac efron women are sexual and sometimes downright pervy and the media is finally catching on im not sure if you feel otherwise because women dont act this way toward you but ladies can be downright aggressive when a hot guy catches their eye
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then its still rude and disrespectful but its less devaluing to her as a human so incrementally better the best option is to say nice playing and silently think nice boobs to yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i never said males are not competitive what i said is that for centuries men have engineered society to keep women as second class citizens that is a fact and that is the reason for the wealth disparity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think women fully realize how it is and all the implications of it we do we rarely approach men for sex or romance because we are constantly being approached by men ourselves the constant attention paid to our bodies and appearance good or bad is exhausting and the last thing most attractive women want to do is invite any more than they already receive we see how imbalanced it is but arent in a position to do anything about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im asking you to prove causation between men chasing women and men having well paid jobs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont have any experience being a lesbian or bisexual woman but im guessing at least some of them have to be proactive otherwise there wouldnt be any couples
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the comment was specifically introduced as a way to approach a woman not coming from a boyfriendhusband totally different context
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,certain people can make certain comments who are you more likely to take health advice from l kim k or your doctor who is more likely to break your heart your gf or your neighbor whos advice on your work performance are going to take more seriously your boss or the janitor the same goes for husbandsboyfriends vs random stranger
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah is op seriously trying to justify leaving nice boobs comments on youtube videos
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or maybe its just that you are an uptight westerner who cant understand my jamaican colorful spontaneity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,we arent animals you should tell that to fat acceptance feminists who try to justify their gluttony with body positivity and other maladaptive concepts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sure but im not just talking about one feminist contradicting another im saying that even just one feminist will sometimes even contradict themselves even two sentences apart
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you wouldnt mind adding it to the post that will make it conform to the rules thanks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not necessarily contrasting your point theres nothing wrong with it just a factual correction i fucking hate when people imply that alan turing or leonardo da vinci or teslaa virgin expanded our understanding of the universe created the most important achievements of mankind just for a womens regular dirty vagina if youre that guy i feel sorry for you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,facepalm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,agreed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a fellow rper i would say that both are true there are those who do it instinctively chads and there are those who learn us
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rofl
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not their argument though their argument is that people ignore her for example guitar skills and exclusively focuses on her body in reality women are given positive feedback for their for example guitar skills all the time and frankly most of this is genuine guys convince themselves that she has talent or at least promise because theyre smitten its not some evil manipulative ploy to get in their pants its thirst combined with be nice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,attractive women that happen to have talent but attractive first id say adele is the closest thing to a better example but shes cute too if she wasnt so fat she could be hot
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,some women do spend hours on their makeupz but many women dont sorry but this is not one of those situations at some point she is going to do so when she goes out gets married goes to a senior year high school event or even a formal dinner at some point she is going to have to put in effort secondly i mentioned appearance this can also mean whether she exercises or not women are not ignorant about the impact of how they look i remember a few years ago when a columnist complained that some teen boys were taking pictures of women at a stadium during a sports event these women were in their bikinis and other revealing swimsuits yes the guys should not have done it but you cannot control what people do with their phones and it is near impossible to check they were not taking pics of of grossly overweight women we cannot claim to be ignorant of the fact that women garner sexual attention based on how they look saying nice tits may not be nice and once again mens sexuality and its expression or desires is pretty much shown to be crude because it wasnt nice to women but what of it what if they are nice what if she wore a push up bra or was blessed with a nice perky set she can choose to be offended or brush it off if you have breasts that get attention someone is going to look get used to it if you are pretty or handsome people are going to be nicer to you if you are short and unattractive be ready to be overlooked the world is not always nice that being said there are many men who call women beautiful and still get chastised because they dare to notice her beauty its simple if shes putting effort into her appearance shes trying to get the attention of attractive men first and foremost that doesnt mean the others arent going to notice as much as women want the unattractive guys to not notice they exist when a woman has something attractive about her and she puts effort into her appearance such as by flaunting what she has she is going to get attention from many different men women in entertainment also do a lot to make sure they look good when they perform watch a music video and see all the women dancing in revealing outfits beyonce is as well known for her music as her physique check out womens tabloid and gossip magazines when someone has snapped pics of her in a bikini on the beach mens magazines tend not to do the same they hire her for a photo shoot so what do you think happens when she gets on stage has some cleavage on show or a revealing outfit shes going to get someone who will comment on how sexy she looks because her intention was to be attractive a man saying nice tits is really just pointing out the obvious they sell sex just as much as they sell music and theyre happy getting sexual attention if indeed it boosts viewership and ratings if shes on a public platform and performing her image is under as much scrutiny as her music if she chooses to feel offended then she can either dial it back and play in a nonrevealing outfit wear no make up and be as unattractive as possible or risk having her ass checked out by someone in the front row its going to happen if she cannot deal with it show business or the music industry is not the ideal environment for her if she is just some youtube wanabe who is trying to impress with her musical talent she has more control over her wardrobe if she has some cleavage and complains when someone says nice tits again dial it back if youre scared of sexual comments think about all the male popstars and boy bands who are practically worshipped by teen girls theyre not just in love with their music those boy bands have been reduced to sex objects as well they call them heart throbs and hunks many a rockstar has had some woman throwing her underwear his way and many of the fans would love to sleep with them why is it okay to reduce them to sex objects but not the women if its not okay for the one then it is not okay for the other but the world doesnt work this way so if someone says nice tits keep in mind theres someone who still wants to suck mick jagger off or would kill to have his lips all over their body hes had like or so lovers as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theyre spending countless hours to improve something whether its their appearance or guitar skills either way theyre working hard i am sure she isnt doing her hair make up and going to gym to look terrible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i watch a guitar performance and comment on a particular part of a song but not the entire performance have i reduced her entire performance to just one passage of one song furthermore have i reduced her entire performance solely to the aspects of that portion that i thought were worthy of comment if i mention that she exhibited excellent fingering at that one point am i neglecting that she exhibited excellent fingering everywhere else am i neglecting all of the other good qualities she exhibited at that one point and elsewhere by the simple fact of me a mere man commenting on her a wonderful woman i have reduced her what right do i a man have to judge her performance and offer my own thoughts as though simply by virtue of my penis i have a right to say anything at all what right do i have to attempt to define her performance with a comment commenting on her song reduces it just as much as commenting on her boobs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im happy that youre being consistent although i dont think most people would consider that reducing her to nearly the same extent as with sexual comments also i dont see why its wrong that the thing you have to care most about is the performance maybe it wasnt that great but her shoes or microphone are really good or maybe her performance was great but you have a particular interest in shoes or microphones if youre into fashion or audio production
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont know if a woman is playing the guitar and your only comment is nice microphone i would still consider that a reduction of her performance and talents its dismissive okay so what if that was said to a man would you be equally offended on his behalf
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as someone who plays i always appreciate any commentscriticism about my gear especially from someone who just listened to me play i put a lot of work into setting up my rig and getting angry about someone complimenting my amp or even my hair just seems childish not only because i know my hair looks good but i see no reason in getting worked up about online compliments or insults objectification and reduction seem like laughable fake problems its not anyones fault other than the girl who gets her panties in a wad every time she hears nice boobs shes the one letting herself get offended instead of saying yeah my boobs are pretty nice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do those things not count as reducing her in the same way also although whether you like it isnt the same thing as whether its reducing you ill point out that a whole lot of people would rather have their body appreciated than their tastechoice in shoes or microphones
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not like bodies just appear fully formed a compliment on someones body is a compliment of their chosen diet fitness and physical activity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not questioning the idea that its an irrelevant comment and odd to post i also dont see the point in making such a comment in fact as a guy i actually find it somewhat annoying when some other guys make irrelevant comments like that its the reducing part that i dont agree with i question the logic behind the idea that commenting on a sexual part of them is reducing them to that part while commenting on another part of them isnt im skeptical of the ways that many people see sex and commenting on sexual things as special and two that its the kind of comment that mainly plagues women and is meant to put her in her place as a sex object rather than a respected artist for example i dont think its reasonable to see simple expressions of sexual desire from men and assume that the intention is to put women in their place without something specific in the message that actually saysimplies that i think thats an exceptionally uncharitable interpretation kind of like how many trpersaltrighters have a tendency to overinterpret actions from women as being about emasculating men or either literally or nonliterally cucking them a more reasonable interpretation would be that theyve felt a strong feeling of desire and theyre expressing that perhaps its irrelevant but i dont think its necessarily sinister you mention the fact that its more often done to women than to men this is likely true although i suspect that the disparity isnt as big as we might think because we simply care more about comments on womens looks and are more likely to notice them like how trumps been attacked for insulting womens looks but he also insults mens looks people just dont care as much to notice but still more comments on womens sexual desirability to me it seems more likely that this is because men are just more forward with their sexual desires in general rather than because they want to put women in their place
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so how about those who say youre pretty and similia the concept is the same its just worded differently
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so why do comments like that bother you so much im not a fan of them either but i dont see the point of discouraging them and again pretending that women who like compliments dont exist isnt exactly convincing anyone of anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,httpwwwtobaccofreemaineorgchannelsprovidersgenderdifferencesphp relapse rates in women are higher and it may take a number of attempts before the achieve success httpswwwdrugabusegovpublicationsresearchreportstobaccoaretheregenderdifferencesintobaccosmoking largescale smoking cessation trials show that women are less likely to initiate quitting and may be more likely to relapse if they do quit httpswwwtherecoveryvillagecomdrugaddictionstudybetweengenders although males abuse drugs at an earlier age and more frequently than females females tend to become addicted more quickly once they are introduced to drugs — a phenomenon known as telescoping women tend to relapse at higher rates than men after going through rehab and they tend to suffer from more serious consequences to their health occupational status relationships and finances telescoping is a term used to describe an accelerated progression from the initiation of substance use to the onset of dependence and first admission to the phenomenon has been consistently observed in investigations of gender and substanceuse disorders with studies typically reporting an accelerated progression among women for opioids cannabis and thus when women enter substance abuse treatment they typically present with a more severe clinical profile eg more medical behavioral psychological and social problems than men despite having used less of the substance and having used the substance for a shorter period of time compared with men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,u got btfo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you may be underestimating how easily sjws can be triggered
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i like watching yoga vids and sometimes i leave comments on how hot is the yoga instructor but im not explicit if feminists had their way i would be jailed in no time i know that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women understand male sexuality very well not any women that ive known lol many women think they understand male sexuality very well but the fact that so many make the mistake of thinking that male sexuality is only about wanting to put their dicks in a wet hole would indicate that they dont while the physical aspects of sex are more prominent in men the physical act of sex is also the predominant way men experience intimacy as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women understand male sexuality very well you have much more faith in women on this point at least than i do i dont think the ideal male body is all that different whether youre talking about jacked gorilla or otter body certain features are just universally attractive and always will be its like heidi klum and kate moss they both have symmetrical features large eyes an ideal whr but their attractiveness is totally different imo either way i think you hit on a good point in your initial post
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women understand male sexuality very well this is hilarious sorry
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women understand male sexuality very well i would say women understand what men are physically attracted to pretty well but when it comes to mens needs for intimacy or the sexual experiences of unattractive men i would say most women fall short of understanding
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i have no idea but im guessing beggars cant be choosers sex is better than no sex but thats a good point
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,probably because its the only outlet they have and its better than nothing but also sex in prisons is often used to establish a social hierarchy its not necessarily about attraction just like a lot of civilian rape isnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh agreed im not denying that i was just playing by rps awalt rule if its true for the vast majority assume its true for all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its simple dick pics can work for alphas they dont for betas going back to the previous comment i think what a lot of men dont understand is that women are not automatically attracted to male body parts the way men are to female for example i will admit that the other day i was watching porn where a fat nerd girl was playing with herself she was not conventionally attractive at all but hell she had a nice pussy i fapped i doubt many women would watch a porn of a fat bald man playing with himself maybe some gay men with a fetish would
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,damn that original wolverine wasnt even that long ago
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was talking about what women want its pretty well acknowledged that wolverine is a fairly open homoerotic movie even mainstream gossip publication opened its comments to it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ladies can be downright aggressive when a hot guy catches their eye men are attracted to the majority of young females women only to some hot guy and celebrity status is relevant while for men its irrelevant if shes famous or not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it might be one of the reasons but under equal conditions men still outperform women because their level of competition is naturally higher
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,for centuries men have engineered society to keep women as second class citizens that is a fact not second class citizens they were kept in the female role and made to give birth to and raise children and keep the home that was just considered a womans responsibility
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what i said is that for centuries men have engineered society to keep women as second class citizens that is a fact and that is the reason for the wealth disparity no they havent the elites have sought to engineer society in a way that would allow them to maximise their wealth and power granted most of them happened to be men but this was incidental rather than a call to arms plus they were small in number there was no preoccupation with keeping women as second class citizens and no preferential treatment given to men on the basis of their male identity alone there was never any loyalty between rich men and poor men just because they were men ordinary working men were used exploited and discarded far more than women also remember that of newborn beneficiaries of the wealthy elites would have been women not to mention the scores of women that could marry into wealth chivalry was a thing and men were far more protective towards women than they were men this idea that women were a persecuted class is a feminist fabrication there was no gender divide in this respect and women were not the enemy also feminist projects have been funded generously by male dominated governments and wealthy men since the societies emerge uncontrollably and unintentionally successive generations merely adopt the preexisting cultural mores in those societies few have the knowledge awareness confidence authority control or capacity to think to or to direct society in immoderate ways unless widespread grievances are expressed when they are thats when change happens furthermore in past centuries especially people would have been very diffident about their level of knowledge and far more likely to defer to authorities like the church and monarchies entrenched cultural beliefs and superstitions would have been far harder to shake off back then than they even are today which is saying a lot because they are pretty entrenched now despite this supposedly being the information age the main danger for the elites would have been poor men these are the people you have to control the most because they have the potential to cause the most trouble and have the biggest incentive as karl marx explained other than that inherent human myopia and powerlessness dictates that most people are far too preoccupied with the dramas in their own lives to have any room for grand visions about directing society or any belief that they actually could then and now most people of both genders are just trying to survive for themselves or a small family they are not in a position to do much more than that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im asking you to prove causation between men chasing women and men having well paid jobs there are some studies on this title my post from earlier in the thread addressing this topic
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,true and so you have the proactive ones who are going out and meeting people and getting to know them instead of objectifying them like op because they cant control themselves
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and as i pointed out ive used it or very similar statements successfully as an approach as well always in a context that supported its use but there are times that it can work really well so again its not always disrespectful or if it is always disrespectful there are times that that sort of disrespect is apparently welcomed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i approached my longest ltr by grabbing her ass with both hands in public at a bowling alley we had very briefly interacted prior to that in class as in we knew each others names and thats it she turned around and punched me in the face i laughed she laughed we dated for years and almost got married before i broke it off context varies wildly i was very young and dont do it anymore but the point stands
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nah
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,his has no bearing on the current topic and as ive noted before im no feminist so if you want to stick it to one youre barking up the wrong tree
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not necessarily contrasting your point theres nothing wrong with it just a factual correction i fucking hate when people imply that alan turing or leonardo da vinci or teslaa virgin expanded our understanding of the universe created the most important achievements of mankind just for a womens regular dirty vagina if youre that guy i feel sorry for you sometimes its conscious sometimes its not but its hard to deny that a strong source of mens inspiration and motivation to perform comes from women thats why you get httpsenwikipediaorgwikicourtlylove title and httpsenwikipediaorgwikimuse title its the same throughout the animal kingdom the males have to outcompete other males to get first dibs on the fertile females i know human beings like to think that theyre special but we are just animals whose teleological purpose is to perpetuate the genes that reside in us we are not as smart and above it all as we think despite our capacity to disobey the teleological script of course we all know about men joining rock bands to attract girls but its well understood more generally that social dominance and success increase a mans mating opportunities there are studies such as the one below that support the hypothesis that men perform to compete for mates whether they are conscious of this or not however this is fairly well understood even amongst people who have never seen or heard of a study on the matter miller states that artistic output by males acts as a cultural display to attract mates this claim has been further supported by empirical evidence males are more creative when they have been romantically primed griskevicius et al creative males are favoured by more fertile females haselton and miller and creative activity is positively correlated with mating success nettle and clegg has further shown that male scientific and criminal behaviour may also be considered as cultural displays to attract mates and that such output is greatest at times in an individuals lifetime when their desire to find a mate is highest kanazawa suggests that this is driven by an evolved psychological mechanism in males that compels them to engage in such behaviours as a form of intrasexual competition for mates kanazawa
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it need not be that consciously explicit but the fundamental drive to achieve and succeed comes from that yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the difference between a self absorbed asshole with no friends and chad is often simply looks
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if shes trying to improve a skill she cares about exaggerated positive feedback from thirsty guys is less than helpful you say most of the positive feedback is genuine but then say guys convince themselves that she has talent can such biased feedback really be considered genuine genuine not in the sense that they dont mean it but in that its valid constructive criticism the latter is what she needs not empty flattery from starstruck suitors in effect it doesnt matter whether her skills are being ignored or given shallow lip service theyre both incredibly unhelpful im not one to harp on about female oppression or whatever quite the opposite actually but i dont think thats something guys typically experience the frustration of having to secondguess every accomplishment wondering if you earned it on account of your merit or your vagina do note that both thirsty men and feminists are culpable for that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are more generic looking people who are singers as well and debatably lady gaga it seems as if youre blaming women that the entertainment industry and industry that is literally built upon attractive people doesnt have a fair amount of equally successful unattractive people in it the highest paid artists and actors are at least a i am disagreeing that attractive celebrities can get away with not having talent more often however women arent the sole blame for that was able to delve into acting in the worst critiqued transformers film soley because she was hot megan fox did an arguably better acting job but we all know she wasnt cast in that film explicitly for her talent kim ks initial fame was a result of her sex tape that people flocked to watch and then started praising her for looks despite her not having any other talent and nicki minaj was straight up twerking and wearing bra tops and leggings throughout barbershop for all four of those girls their female fans werent the ones who catapulted them into fame it was men on the flip side there are exceptions to every rule is not that attractive but is the lead in the incredibly popular tv show portlandia which has largely a female audience some sitcoms do well with both genders like and none of the leads are conventionally attractive then you have which is popular with men despite louis ck not being super attractive the cast of hamilton is doing amazing well not because is a hearthrob but because the show is really great the same can be said for broadway cast lastly is netflixs flagship and is incredibly popular becuse of the writing and the acting not the hottness of the all female cast
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bc they are complimenting on something that has little to do with what she is doing if she was a makeup artist then yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i watch a guitar performance and comment on a particular part of a song but not the entire performance have i reduced her entire performance to just one passage of one song this reads to me as extraordinarily tone deaf i find it hard to believe that you truly cant tell the difference between commenting on the song and guitarplaying itself vs commenting about her tits by the simple fact of me a mere man commenting on her a wonderful woman i have reduced her my comment stands no matter what the gender dynamics are i clarified this in another comment if a person plays the guitar for you and you you can only make a positive remark about something unrelated to the performance it will generally be interpreted as dismissive or insulting what right do i have to attempt to define her performance with a comment dude its youtube say whatever the fuck you want sometimes people will disagree with you its up to you whether that bothers you enough that youll cease commenting all together
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if youre commenting on something like a microphone on a music video thats still pertinent to the video and its appropriate feedback to give to a musician the kind of mic used can really affect the quality of a performance so telling her you like the mic shes using is useful information for her to have but commenting on something like shoes or hair or breasts is inappropriate based upon the type of video it is its useless information in that context its reductionist its passively insulting and its best kept to yourself
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont think most people would consider that reducing her to nearly the same extent as with sexual comments i agree its probably not considered reductive to the same degree but it still comes off as an insult its like when you see a friends amateur play and you cant think of anything nice so you say the programs were really well done maybe you loooove programs but more likely you didnt like or didnt pay attention to the actual performance i also think that women are more sensitive to comments about their body or their looks because in the past theyve often been placed in eye candy roles the hot secretary the bouncy cheerleader the useless chick in movies theyre already expecting that their looks will be the first noticeable thing about them and comments about their tits or shoes just reaffirm that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im personally not offended on anyones behalf in this situation but yes i would feel the same way if the genders were reversed if your compliment is unrelated to the performance its like saying you have nothing positive to say about the performance itself i clarified this in another comment
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people are free to make whatever comments they like in return people are free to be offended by it you cant have one without the other if you want to make comments about a strangers tits be aware that they may respond
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why do those things not count as reducing her in the same way because its complimenting something that is a conscious choice she picked out those awesome shoes or microphone those things are high quality her taste is high quality good for her its not the same if all you have to say about a woman is nice boobs in the given example of the guitar video the comment is dismissing her skill effort level and the point of the video focusing on a body part that isnt relevant and can be found anywhere online is a rude comment that serves no purpose but to let the girl in the video and everyone else know that the only value you see in the video is boobs surely you can see the difference between telling a dressedup person they look good and put themselves together well and telling someone who posted a video intended to showcase their musical skills that they have nice boobs
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,boobs are pretty much entirely genetics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,congratulations on managing to grow breasts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but still more comments on womens sexual desirability to me it seems more likely that this is because men are just more forward with their sexual desires in general rather than because they want to put women in their place i dont think this is something done consciously in most cases but rather its that people see women in such a sexualized manner so often that a womans sexuality and appearance becomes the focus even if whatever shes actually doing isnt remotely sexual our culture teaches us that its normal to sexualize women so much and its ok to project all our sexual thoughts onto them even if it would seem strange to do the same thing to a man see the hawkeye initiative thats partially due to the male gaze being dominant in media and partially from the traditional value of a woman being her looks this is where the gender part of this comes in its just so unusual for men to be scrutinized and evaluated mostly on their looks like women are to tie this into ops post his comment would be just one more instance where a womans looks are valued more highly than what shes actually doing perpetuating the notion in our culture that her value comes from her looks more than her actions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it actually does have the same negative connotations reducing her to just her appearance but at least its not as rude it doesnt carry the same amount of disrespect meaning it is more likely to be taken in the spirit it is being offered
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so why do comments like that bother you so much im not a fan of them either but i dont see the point of discouraging them they dont bother me but they bother a lot of people mostly women theyre rude dismissive and make people feel bad with absolutely no benefit why shouldnt this behavior be discouraged and again pretending that women who like compliments dont exist isnt exactly convincing anyone of anything im not pretending anything there are women who would probably appreciate a stranger paying them a witty and respectful compliment nice boobs is neither and even a woman who is generally receptive to compliments would probably find it clumsy and infantile at best and actively disrespectful at worst
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what a witty and intelligent argument you have bested me sir i shall turn in my keyboard and remove myself from all online discussion forthwith
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you may be fundamentally misunderstanding the meaning of the word triggered
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,jailed for comments on a video i mean yeah its rude but i havent met a feminist in my life that would advocate for criminal penalties for something like that i mean im sure feminist extremists that would support that idea are out there but they have little voice and even less power within the movement for the most part they seem to exist primarily in the fevered imaginations of mras and conservative talk show hosts unless youre actually making threats which is already illegal the worst most feminists would want to see happen would be banning if the comment is really bad and violates the tos or simply the community downvoting until it is not visible were trying to change hearts and minds not jail dissenters
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eh women understand what turns men on hot bodies good looks big tits long legs tight ass pretty face women get that they dont always like it but they get it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that probably says it better than i did and is closer to my intent
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah i have a feeling its because of their raging need for sex but that just proves the drive is so strong than it can indeed be altered to fit the environment like if literally all women became obese ball busting sluts tomorrow men wouldnt just give up on sex forever id argue because of the power of the sex drive male sexuality is the most malleable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was just playing by rps awalt rule if its true for the vast majority assume its true for all yep im totally with you on that one lol i would definitely recommend treating it as the truth unless really convinced otherwise by an individual woman and again and ime the kind of woman who is the exception may not be the average dudes cup o tea the riskreward ratio is just piss poor on that approach imo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,all of the guys are considered ideal but the and guys are not the jacked gorillas like you said peoples magazine has a largely female readership
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,to a majority of young females what counts as a majority do nonwhite andor overweight women fit into that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men still outperform women because their level of competition is naturally higher you mean incels and mgotw because those guys are refusing to compete and according to rp theory they make up of men today so according to rp you are wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that female role included no access to political representation no ability to leave abusive marriages no ability to stave of unwanted pregnancy and almost no ability to begin businesses of their own get an education or have a career in short they were not in charge of their own lives i consider that second class status the lack of voting rights alone is enough to guarantee that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the elites have sought to engineer society in a way that would allow them to maximise their wealth and power granted most of them happened to be men weird coincidence right but this was incidental so let me get this straight these faceless elites can engineer an entire society but they do not engineer the people they let into their club is that what youre trying to say you need to think this through and try again there are some pretty serious plot holes you need to address
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you make good points there but i still hold that other factors are just as if not more significant in explaining why men are currently at the top of the social pyramid social status is about more than sex for one thing men care about the opinions of other men too men care about money and possessions too its disingenuous to suggest that the fundamental reason is to impress women i also think its pretty bold to say men will always be at the top women have come a long way already whether or not you think thats right you cant deny the trend
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as twcountrymusic said i referred to when a comment is directed at a random woman just because something it has gotten you laid it doesnt mean that it works for most people or with most women also women who want casual might prefer more direct approaches that dont work with women that don want casual sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im sure it happens occasionally but in general most women are not going to react kindly to being shouted at or grabbed by a stranger and you might have had just as much success with this girl had you approached her a different way
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,finally atleast a well constructed argument
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,interesting study thanks for posting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you say most of the positive feedback is genuine but then say guys convince themselves that she has talent can such biased feedback really be considered genuine genuine not in the sense that they dont mean it but in that its valid constructive criticism people can rationalize a belief until its genuinely held they can genuinely hold beliefs that have zero rational support pick a political belief you think it completely indefensible millions of people genuinely think thats a good idea and youre changing the definition of genuine genuine doesnt mean valid or constructive it means httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarygenuine the frustration of having to secondguess every accomplishment wondering if you earned it on account of your merit or your vagina i think this complaint has merit and i agree that its not something the average man experiences but thats just the price of constant preferential treatment hearing it is like hearing a rich person complain about not truly knowing if their friends would be their friends if they didnt have money i get it but its the definition of a firstworld problem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,didnt know chris pratt was not considered attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,try controlling their thought process go ahead try stopping them from seeing her boobs and not thinking wow they are nice and why do they have to compliment only within that context you are telling me someone has never told you your hair looks nice or your outfit is great when you were neither a hair stylist nor a clothing designer why should what she is doing matter when he thinks she looks pretty or nice
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,my overarching point is that women objectify themselves and have shit selfesteem if a man plays a rock concert and a female fan says youre hot he smiles because not only is he an awesome rock star hes also hot if you tell a woman nice boobs what she hears is your only quality worthy of comment is your boobs you have no other talent or quality worthy of notice you are purely a sexual object and have no other value as a living creature if you approach a man and indicate that hes sexually attractive he appreciates the complement if you approach a woman and indicate that shes sexually attractive shes offended how can you even say such things when you dont know her as a person yet by commenting on her sexual attractiveness without being familiar with her intellect and personality first you have clearly stated that her intellect and personality are worthless
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this reads to me as extraordinarily tone deaf i find it hard to believe that you truly cant tell the difference between commenting on the song and guitarplaying itself vs commenting about her tits theyre obviously not the exact same comment but why is one reducing while the other isnt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so if they have a gta poster in the background of the video is it inappropriate to bring that up because of the context of the video
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,or a teacher handing back an essay and the only comment is nice handwriting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im personally not offended on anyones behalf in this situation but yes i would feel the same way if the genders were reversed if your compliment is unrelated to the performance its like saying you have nothing positive to say about the performance itself i clarified this in another comment fair enough but let us be honest its generally considered a far greater transgression if offensive comments are directed at a woman as opposed to a man now were even hearing that nonsexual observations and even nonsexual compliments that do not relate to the topic of a womans video are also dismissive this is so ridiculous you couldnt make it up i could see this scene in a satire sketch lampooning feminists
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well sure im not saying people shouldnt have the right to get offended i just dont understand the point in getting so butthurt about comments like sweet titties and its a bit ironic because ive seen bpers call rpers bitter but it goes both ways in this sense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,wouldnt commenting not on her performance prove that her performance maybe isnt really something that great would be nicer to sayyou arent really that great at playing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree thats fair
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the way the breasts appear when clothed is pretty much a function of the chosen clothes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they dont make everyone feel bad sometimes they make people feel good why should anyone care about what makes you feel bad thats not an argument for anything i dont believe for second that you care about not hurting everyones feelings especially when theyre people that have different opinions than you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think most people misunderstand the meaning of that word
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not understanding male sexuality when women get an actual glimpse of real male sexuality they throw up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is worth its own post imo i dont think male sexuality itself is malleable so much as incredibly in discriminatory
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,on a related note i think i just wrapped my head around awalt i feel like i need a cookie or a sticker or something
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you know people is referred to as kneepads bc they work out deals for stuff like this with celebs people right thats how they get exclusives look at who women fan girl out over its no longer the jacked gorillas at best its christ pratt but most women are complaining that hes gotten too jacked
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not overweight at least not in general but overweight girls are a minority pretty much everywhere at least i hope its still the case for the us
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,deliberate misunderstanding of trp again betas are also included in that and if you have been paying attention to your rp it is beta bucks that built civilization and makes the world go round
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,mgtow can rely on hookers and escorts and they have to work hard to afford that kind of services
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and this is because men hated women or at least wanted to retain mens dominant status in society over women right this is the only point where i disagree with you feminists and hell what is currently the dominant historical narrative in society women didnt have those things because they were not necessary for their role in society they werent allowed to leave marriages because marriage vows were considered sacred and not to ever be broken aside from the most extreme circumstances where you and many others see oppression i see only historical society optimizing itself to be as functional as possible do i think we should go back to the way things were historically no but i think we are as a society doing our best to ignore the inherent differences between men and women and we are also overly optimistic about how much strain the institution of marriage can withstand this is all uncharted territory but its probably the only way forward no telling where we will end up as a society but i think as an individual it is safer to understand rp and to know the differences between men and women and the reasons things were the way they were in the past claiming that historically men hated women andor just wanted to keep them down shows a lack of understanding to me people should really give men and women of the past more credit than this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the elites have sought to engineer society in a way that would allow them to maximise their wealth and power granted most of them happened to be men weird coincidence right not really men have certain qualities that resulted in the most powerful amongst them ascending to power but that does not mean they had any loyalty to men atlarge on the basis of gender in fact the title suggests otherwise but this was incidental so let me get this straight these faceless elites can engineer an entire society but they do not engineer the people they let into their club is that what youre trying to say the second factor is that the tendency towards selfinterest meaning personal selfinterest not male genderinterest is far greater in all humans than altruism people seek their own individual advantage and use the best positioned and most effective tools to achieve this back then that would have meant using men when it came to wealth and power brokerage this is not a function of gender this is just about what is expedient and human selfinterest thirdly men were subjected to the same levels of indoctrination as everyone else this goes to the hyperagency vs hypoagency attribution we often see respectively given to men and women we see men as perpetrators and women as victims both men and women were hardly in a position to have our modern ideas about truth justice and equality men were victims of circumstance just like everyone else born into and educated by a preexisting culture they had nothing to do with creating nevertheless there were still progressive individuals ahead of their time they were just outnumbered it usually takes accumulating grievances hitting critical mass before society atlarge can conceive of let alone act upon grand changes even httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvymicjbqwaie title waited for popular support before he publically supported gay marriage men were not this omniscient omnipotent class who knew better but were evil and wanted to keep women down both men and women believed in the correctness of the labour divisions that had long been established before their time and were perpetually endorsed by what they believed to be the voice of god via their religions its a bit grand to expect them to somehow see through this all i guarantee if you were born a few hundred years ago you would hold very different opinions to the ones you have today you need to think this through and try again there are some pretty serious plot holes you need to address no there are no plot holes in my argument there are in yours though if were generous and even call them arguments
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,men care about money and possessions too those are mostly baits to get women i also think its pretty bold to say men will always be at the top women have come a long way already whether or not you think thats right you cant deny the trend i dont see women overthrowing men any time soon you wouldnt see feminist propaganda peddling the dichotomy men privileged women oppressed everywhere if women were capable of reaching the top by their own
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you make good points there but i still hold that other factors are just as if not more significant in explaining why men are currently at the top of the social pyramid social status is about more than sex for one thing men care about the opinions of other men too men care about money and possessions too its disingenuous to suggest that the fundamental reason is to impress women a lot of this is not even conscious the study actual says that fluctuating testosterone t levels are discussed as providing the underlying biochemical changes necessary for such mechanisms so much of this is happening at the lizard level even though men can also be conscious of sex being a strong motivator i dont think status for statuses sake is really a thing for men naturally men like the freedom and pleasures money can bring but they are not really about beating the joneses thats something you see more with women also men are very low maintenance and tend to be more tolerant of grubby environments than women men know this so know that they have to create nice environments to attract attractive women i also think its pretty bold to say men will always be at the top women have come a long way already whether or not you think thats right you cant deny the trend well its impossible to say for sure what will happen in the future but in a lord of the flies type situation women could not compete in modern western societies however we make special efforts to help women and shore up any inherent disadvantages they may have men also have a proven and large track record sample when it comes to technological innovation whereas we dont know what society would look like if women had been at the helm of productivity women have come a long way but on one level thats not really saying much given that they largely were not even in the game at all before women are human after all if you give any demographic the same opportunities and support women have had over the past or so years large numbers would also do very well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also women who want casual might prefer more direct approaches that dont work with women that don want casual sex i find a lot of women are at least open to having casual sex far more than is presumed at least
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the comment was specifically introduced as a way to approach a woman not coming from a boyfriendhusband totally different context i gave you same context and you discounted anyways with well all women are different if all women are different maybe some do enjoy being objectified by the men they desire
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most women are not going to react kindly to being shouted at or grabbed by a stranger by a generic stranger in a generic situation im likely to agree with you but by a specific kind of stranger in a specific situation it can work better than many other approaches in fact i usually utilize that kind of approach when i see other guys trying those different approaches which most often fall into the category of being less aggressively sexual and more nice and ingratiating and failing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre welcome
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the desire to procreate more accurately the desire to have someone bring us to orgasm is our most important evolutionary drive other than selfpreservation you sound like youre still in the anger phase but thats no reason to not think about things logically just an aside but i found it interesting that the three geniuses you mentioned turing da vinci and tesla were all gay was that intentional
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,rather than just saying that you dont agree why not post reasons
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he wasnt anything special he got in shape later
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are telling me someone has never told you your hair looks nice or your outfit is great when you were neither a hair stylist nor a clothing designer when i am giving a presentation on oxidative stress and i ask for questions or comments on said presentation nobody in their right mind would say nice tits after the presentation is done and i am seated and we are not in that context then yes someone will comment on my hairmakeup and or clothes and by out of that context i mean out to lunch or something trivial a really good example of this being done to a male was a scientist that managed to land a spacecraft on a comet instead of talking about his huge accomplishment they talked about his shirt
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,your only quality worthy of comment is your boobs you have no other talent or quality worthy of notice you are purely a sexual object and have no other value as a living creature isnt that what trp has been saying this whole time clearly a lot of men believe this about women enough to influence the message that society gives women not to mention historically a womans appearance and sexuality were literally her only source of worth and power remember it wasnt long ago that daughters were being traded for goats
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes women are much more sensitive when it comes to sexual comments especially in the performing arts in the past theyre regularly been relegated to eye candy supporting roles cheering on the real athletes damsels in distress the token useless chick halfnaked on the rolling stone etc its definitely changing women are now getting acting roles with substance praise for their musical talent and writing and getting attention for athletic ability beyond what their body looks like but its a slow process women still feel they need to fight to be taken seriously in these avenues and sexual comments undermine that i dont deny that women and men react very differently to the same compliments but there are valid reasons behind it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is deeper than that actually both genders as in most people tend to project their own values on an interaction so when a guy playing a guitar hears nice butt he takes the compliment because that is how he would mean it when a female guitarist hears nice boobs and women say that this detracts from the musician that is because this is how the women would mean it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,commenting on how a guy has such a nice job and is so rich is the same as commenting on nice tits they both suck i really stated to sympathy women once i started earning money the feeling when bitches are only after your cash is really shitty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,commenting on the guitar playing means you recognize the point of the video when the music is the focus commenting on the talent is welcome and relevant its what being showcased commenting on her tits means that even when the video is explicitly focusing on her guitar playing her body is still the first and possibly only thing you see
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,maybe inappropriate is the wrong word irrelevant yes but if you cant see the difference in commenting on someones poster and commenting on their breasts i cant help you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is nothing new complimenting something tiny and unrelated because you dont like the larger picture is a very common tactic its like if your friend showed you a large and expensive piece of art they bought and you responded with i like the frame because its god awful but you dont want to hurt their feelings i think youre overreacting to this something might be a little insulting but its not the end of world people comment nice boobs on videos all the time no one really cares it has nothing to do with feminism so much as social etiquette its generally considered a far greater transgression if offensive comments are directed at a woman as opposed to a man true but theres nothing i can do about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the point is that if something bothers you you dont have to lay down and take it if enough people call a behaviour offensive it becomes socially unacceptable and the person doing it may face social consequences as a result it also just feels good to say what youre thinking sometimes surely a ppd user can understand that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well no it would be nicer to say nothing and move on or give constructive criticism if you cant control yourself for whatever reason
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you could just not say anything i mean thats an option
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if you cant say something nice dont say anything at all everyones mom
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i would love to see one example of a person being made to feel good by a random stranger saying nice boobs to them out of the blue this mythical person might even exist but i guarantee you dont know them any more than i do im not even sure why youre trying to defend this i actually try very hard not to hurt anyones feelings even if i disagree with them i will debate strongly but i generally try to avoid saying things that will directly attack and hurt the person i focus on their ideas if i do hurt someones feelings i apologize and try to make amends when it does happen it is almost always because i have fucked up and misread a situation or taken a joke too far or just not realized that my actions will have that effect on the rare occasion that i have or would do something that i know will hurt someone it is only with careful consideration of exactly what i am doing and why and i have come to a decision that the pain i am going to cause is worth it and there is no other way and i do whatever i can to mitigate the hurt as much as possible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,probably i do know what it actually means and based on how you are using it im pretty sure you dont or youre intentionally misusing it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,examples edit you dont even have to link to anything just elaborate on when women get an actual glimpse of real male sexuality they throw up ive seen women throw up when presented with the plight of betas ive seen women throw up when presented with the reality of the nasty shit they really like doing with the men theyre really hot for but repulsion at real male sexuality nah they respond very favorably to it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol yeah that is probably a good example of how awalt is often related to and used in discussion the other is related to the base of humanfemale nature the innate instincts and drives
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most women are complaining about chris pratt and would disagree the best selling boy band today is the best selling boy band in the early was as soon as both groups broke up and the target fanbased changed from tween girls to women and men they started to look different the lead in one of the most watched tv shows now is the walking dead and has a huge fangirl base had a huge fangirl base in lost was the most watched show in people magazine wouldnt make men the sexiest man alive if they knew that women didnt find those men uber attractive already so yes part of it is a deal with the celeb but they wouldnt have made the deal if the celeb didnt already have women fauning over them or if no one knew him
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and thats where i have to disagree most men are not attracted to most women your grossly oversimplifying minority women do not have the luxury that white women have as being marketed as incredibly attractive or as a trophy there are still guys who cribge at the thought of havif a black or latina on their arm or think that all asian women are subservient lotus flowers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youre saying beta men are competitive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no they dont single men with average or above incomes can easily afford escorts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,and this is because men hated women or at least wanted to retain mens dominant status in society over women right of course if you occupy the top strata within society you fight to retain that privileged position women didnt have those things because they were not necessary for their role in society they werent allowed to leave marriages because marriage vows were considered sacred and not to ever be broken aside from the most extreme circumstances where you and many others see oppression i see only historical society optimizing itself to be as functional as possible fantastic but women never chose that role it was chosen for them that is the critical point here
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,those are mostly baits to get women well youre entitled to your opinion but i disagree why is it that women care about the possessions a man has but men only care about getting women using those possessions i dont see women overthrowing men any time soon well im sure well agree to disagree but i dont think thats the aim
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also men are very low maintenance and tend to be more tolerant of grubby environments than women sheesh you wouldnt say that if you saw a whole bunch of student flats trust me anyway i cant really argue against what youre saying re men wanting to attract women more than have possessions i just think youre wrong for one thing i think its fair to assume that for the most part men and women like different things whether or not this is right and the things men buy generally arent going to impress most women theres some overlap to use stereotypes but i doubt many women are going to be impressed by most of my possessions though i am hardly wealthy where i do spend my money is not on anything im expecting to get laid with well its impossible to say for sure what will happen in the future but in a lord of the flies type situation women could not compete in modern western societies however we make special efforts to help women and shore up any inherent disadvantages they may have its not quite like that its not like women are inherently worse at things than men they are less physically powerful but that makes a difference really only in job selection and i dunno moving heavy things sometimes the ways in which women have been oppressed throughout history dont come down to how strong they are physically though you might argue thats where the roots lie its just a systematic thing i dont think just allowing women to live like men do is making special effort its just letting them be human which they have previously been denied but anyway things are much better now and unless as you say we go to some kind of lord of the flies situation i dont see that trend changing even in that situation who knows really if you give any demographic the same opportunities and support women have had over the past or so years large numbers would also do very well i dont think its fair to say women have been given anything over the past years theyve had to take it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes i even said as much im sure it happens occasionally but i thought trp preferred to deal in generalities instead of focusing on special snowflakes and in general women dont like being approached this way by strangers you found an exception and thats great for you but its not going to work for most people
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in a club or similar setting it would probably be effective or at least shes less likely to be outright offended by it with a girl you already have a rapport with it might work depending on her personality with a random girl on the street unlikely
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont agree but its well constructed there are definitely problematic elements whether or not theres an inclination to argue the point as of yet uncertain
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you saying that you have no other interests besides ones that potentially get you laid
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because reddit arguments have been preoccupying quite abit of time i have other responsibilities maybe ill get to it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,he worked as a male stripper in his teens and also was famous back in long before parks and recreation and guardians of the galaxy made him even more of a leading man here is a picture of him at the teen choice awards where he was already an actor on a popular television show dont confuse his characters with who he is stereotypical dudebro look high testosterone evident he was the stereotypical chad stereotype espoused on the red pill and lots of teen girls swooned over him and much like many other natural alphas he gave up on his body for a while and slipped into a beta frame
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when i am giving a presentation on oxidative stress and i ask for questions or comments on said presentation nobody in their right mind would say nice tits that is an office environment not when you are in the public eye someone can get fired for saying that say that ata a rock concert andat worst you are a jerk with a bad way of complimenting someone a really good example of this being done to a male was a scientist that managed to land a spacecraft on a comet instead of talking about his huge accomplishment they talked about his shirt again he was not in an office environment it was not private it was in the media which is a public platform this opens people up to scrutiny i worked in the media as a reporter for years shoulds and should nots would be great if they actually stopped people from behaving poorly or criticising others unfairly we should not judge people on their appearance but we do i felt sorry for a female bodybuilder we featured once because she worked gard but many men criticized how she looked did it stop her no i respected her choice but i knew what would happen someone was going to comment and it was a risk she took putting herself in the public eye there were greater pay offs such as her getting publicity and sponsorship but people overlook the benefits when someone points out that someone has a nice body women often complain that they feel they are judged on their appearance more than men yet a prominent male scientist was in tears apologizing for wearing a shirt feminists thought was misogynistic that being said there are people who train others on how to deal with the media and what to say this includes what to wear i have nothing against what he wore but in the world we live in someone will take pleasure in crushing someone elses spirit regardless of their accomplishments if you put yourself in the public eye expect armchair critics to do what they do best tell you how you are ruining the world feminists are no exception so what does this mean think about why they put pretty people in front of the camera or why musicians have people dedicated to their appearance inevitably someone is going to comment on their looks it also means that small time performers get scrutinised someone is going to flash the male rockstar even though he is there to perform someone is going to oggle a popstar because she is wearing a revealing outfit someone is going to say nice tits if she feels devalued or reduced to an object then it is not a good idea to enter the entertainment industry or to enter the public arena and rely on others good graces no one can force her to feel anything but her so she could choose to be offended or to just shrug it off you could force people to stop saying things if you are willing to trample on freedom of speech but freedom of speech means giving people the opportunity to say things and express opinions you dont like it also means people get to express good things too like those who liked the music getting hung up on nice tits and letting it crush your spirit when others have nice things to say as well is not helpful to her or the audience that likes her music she should be focused on them first and foremost anyway
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,historically a womans appearance and sexuality were literally her only source of worth and power its still their main one since most women have it available to use while they are young most choose to take advantage of it even women who put in a lot of effort to be good in their chosen fields will still use their charm to help them get ahead and who wouldnt if they had the option
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women do it to themselves they equate their sexual worth with their worth as a human being if youre sexually attracted to her shes pissed off that youre not appreciating her intellect and personality if youre not sexually attracted to her despite the fact that she has phds and cured cancer yesterday which you really admire because she happens to be ugly shes pissed off that youre not appreciating her intellect and personality women consider themselves sex objects they judge their own value by the caliber of men who want to fuck them they completely fail to separate their sexual worth from their value as a human being they consider these two things one and the same you cant want to fuck them unless you know their human worth first and if you know their human worth and dont want to fuck them thats a huge offense
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its shallower than that actually when a loser tells a female guitarist that he really enjoyed the third verse shes annoyed that some loser thinks hes in any position to comment on her talent when a hot guy tells her nice boobs after her performance shes ecstatic because her performance was so hot that this cute guy noticed
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so what are the underlying values here im interested
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youve explained why the author of the video might prefer one of the comments to the other you havent really given an argument for why one of the comments is reducing while the other isnt though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,when the music is the focus then why a video a soundclip wouldve done it as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well yeah one is paper and the other is a chunk of flesh and im not sure what the endgame of all this is but i think being vocal about getting really offended by irrelevant online comments may actually cause more people to make them rather than the opposite for example if you reply to a nice boobs comment with thats really offensive stop objectifying her youll probably get responses saying youre jealous of her tits or people asking for pics of your tits but its kind of funny because if i see a video of a guitarist playing a song and some girl comments omg hes so hot i dont think twice about it and i suppose its relevant as the guy she says is hot is in the video and any girls who also want to discuss how attractive he is are perfectly welcome to do so i dont have to participate and i definitely wont get upset about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but if you cant see the difference in commenting on someones poster and commenting on their breasts i cant help you what people here a getting at is whether the distinction can be justified rationally there are some who argue that the whole sexual objectification trope from feminism is irrational and merely a reformulated consequence of the prudery introduced by the abrahamic religions and revived during the victorian era
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is nothing new complimenting something tiny and unrelated because you dont like the larger picture is a very common tactic its like if your friend showed you a large and expensive piece of art they bought and you responded with i like the frame because its god awful but you dont want to hurt their feelings i think youre overreacting to this something might be a little insulting but its not the end of world people comment nice boobs on videos all the time no one really cares it has nothing to do with feminism so much as social etiquette its generally considered a far greater transgression if offensive comments are directed at a woman as opposed to a man true but theres nothing i can do about it this is new and it has everything to do with feminism what people are commenting on here is this new age of hypersensitivity that has seen the arrival of coddling practices like trigger warnings and safe spaces where relatively mild comments can result in accusations of hate speech and get people noplatformed this all comes from feminism and it is very new
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you dont have to lay down and take it i get that what i dont get is why some online comments bother some people so much in the first place social consequences do you think there should be legal consequences for hurting someones feelings
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if enough people call a behaviour offensive it becomes socially unacceptable and the person doing it may face social consequences as a result and if enough people on the other side of the argument say hey no this shouldnt be considered socially unacceptable then we have exactly the cultural battle that is currently playing out there are enough numbers on both sides of the argument that neither can win out so easily
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also thumper on bambi trps talk about how disney movies shaped their perception of reality but i guess bambi wasnt one of them
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah im using it sarcastically i never really cared enough to look it up but im guessing its used to describe what happens when something causes someone with ptsd to experience symptoms
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women are repulsed by the capacity of men to objectify individual body parts without context any hint of the male reaction to smell the predatory nature of male sexuality that men would gather together in groups to rape a vietnamese hooker in war male fetishism in general did you not see the first replies to this telling him he was creepy for nice boobs and saying supple skin the women reading his post felt like they were being assessed by ed gein
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,people magazine names celebs with big projects in the works as the sexiest in order to curry favor had jennifer aniston in her as the sexiest woman alive but they wouldnt have made the deal if the celeb didnt already have women fauning over them or if no one knew him thats still a far far cry from actually being the sexiest man alive that just means they have a publicist with good connections to kneepads and did you even read your links huffpo is an article about pratts likability vs jlaw and the gender implications access hollywood is about his body transformation he lost pounds thats news worthy for a celeb e has more pics of him chubby in his parks rec days than muscular bustle is all pics of him clothed with images of him in his chubbier days included i cant find the origin of that tshirt so i cant figure out if it was made regardless there are a lot of gay men reblogging that at first glance more so than women but i certainly didnt count buzzfeed is the only one that you could make an argument backs up your point and they only included two shirtless pics the best selling boy band today is one direction the best selling boy band in the early was nsync as soon as both groups broke up and the target fanbased changed from tween girls to women and men they started to look different im not really sure what your point is the lead in one of the most watched tv shows now is the walking dead and daryl dixon has a huge fangirl base sawyer had a huge fangirl base in lost i think this might be one of those socioeconomic andor geographic things that separates the pills absolutely no one i know irl thinks either of those two are attractive the cosby show was the most watched show in who said anything about the cosby show or the
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,married beta men compete to get resources to bring back to their wives and offspring its what trp argues has primarily fueled civilization things are different nowadays with the dismantling of traditional marriage a lot of those men who wouldve been productive betas are not able to get into a lasting marriage so they are mgtows or incels refusing to compete just as you say so yes men are naturally competitive but when you take away the pussy incentive a lot of them dont see the point in competing anymore
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,of course if you occupy the top strata within society you fight to retain that privileged position that model works great for ethnic and economic groups but not so much for sex there isnt any other example where you are sleeping with and providing for members of the group you are trying to keep down i cant imagine a world where men hated women if anything they loved them too much to the point that they overprotected them fantastic but women never chose that role it was chosen for them that is the critical point here exact same has always gone for men too only one sex was capable of giving birth and it was necessary that they focused on that role in order to maximize offspring men were generally bigger and stronger so they were usually laborers who would share the fruits of their labor with those who could not do the same level of strenuous work the unilateral oppression and hatred model that i used to believe in and that the majority of society buys is horribly inadequate to describe historical sex roles if thats what you choose to believe in sir knight then you are free to do so but i personally think that this popular view is a bit insulting to both men and women of the past its so condescending to think that men of today are generally so much kinder to women than were men of the past and equally so that women of the past were either too weak or stupid to do anything about it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sheesh you wouldnt say that if you saw a whole bunch of student flats trust me anyway i cant really argue against what youre saying re men wanting to attract women more than have possessions i just think youre wrong for one thing i think its fair to assume that for the most part men and women like different things whether or not this is right and the things men buy generally arent going to impress most women theres some overlap to use stereotypes but i doubt many women are going to be impressed by most of my possessions though i am hardly wealthy where i do spend my money is not on anything im expecting to get laid with certainly you can deny it but youre wrong thats not to say that men dont like possessions just that they are more preoccupied with sex than a desire to live extravagant lives to quote tony montana of scarface fame httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvebcflbbgkhe title as for female students flats theyre probably neater than male students flats on average we also know that most students are notoriously poor and dont yet have the resources to live in nice places unless they have wealthy parents so shabby female student digs are probably more a function of necessity than indifference its not quite like that its not like women are inherently worse at things than men they are less physically powerful but that makes a difference really only in job selection and i dunno moving heavy things sometimes the ways in which women have been oppressed throughout history dont come down to how strong they are physically though you might argue thats where the roots lie its just a systematic thing i dont think just allowing women to live like men do is making special effort its just letting them be human which they have previously been denied but anyway things are much better now and unless as you say we go to some kind of lord of the flies situation i dont see that trend changing even in that situation who knows really its fairly obvious that there are widespread behavioural differences between men and women across eras and cultures now feminists like to attribute this all to socialisation by regurgitating their social constructivist theories but people arent buying it and the science does not support it title that there are widespread cognitive differences between men and women and that men have a stronger predilection towards abstract rational thinking i hope you wont be sophomoric about this and say but not all women or not all men of course not all we are talking about overwhelming tendencies and trends here just as we would say that men are stronger than or taller than women obviously this will not always be the case but it is a recognisable tendency across large demographics even if we ignore the impact testosterone has on our cognitive preferences and abilities before and after birth it can be reasonably inferred that physical differences in strength alone impact our cognitive outlook on the world feeling less physically vulnerable and having more physical options can give a person a cognitive edge in itself not to mention the actual tangible advantages in shaping the world that being physically stronger can provide if we are adopting a reasonable use of the word oppressed i contest the idea that women were oppressed in any targeted manner over the centuries all demographics have had to endure restrictions of one kind or another including men i dont see that as oppression in the everyday use of the term black people have been oppressed the jews have been oppressed muslims have been oppressed palestinians are being oppressed but this idea that half the population were systematically oppressed in this manner is nonsense women were intertwined with the order of those societies just as men were these supposed oppressors had grandmothers mothers wives daughters sisters nieces they would have to be psychopathic to oppress their own flesh and blood is it really reasonable to believe most men were psychopathic during these periods i have written a post on this topic in this same thread title well you might not think that special efforts have been made to help women but you would be wrong a great deal has been done to uniquely assist and accommodate women men dont get this treatment they are just expected to endure and perform whatever the environment and if they start failing they are discarded and ignored as we see with the boy crisis in education high suicide rates and the disproportionate number of homeless men how about treating men like title i dont think its fair to say women have been given anything over the past years theyve had to take it the fact is women have asked for things and men have acquiesced its a symbiotic relationship
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,but i thought trp preferred to deal in generalities instead of focusing on special snowflakes im a married trper so maybe im the weird one in general i find women like men who put forth an effort to show interest so long as they find him attractive to start with aka hot guys get away with shit that less hot guys would get lynched for
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,with a random girl on the street unlikely i agree but thats the distinction that needs to be made i for years believed the thats always disrespectful no matter what view which is fed directly into the why do assholes always get the girls frustration part of swallowing the red pill for me lo those many years ago was coming to the realization that being an asshole wasnt a fixed state it all depended on who she was who i was and what the situation was it was totally foreign to me and felt incredibly awkward at first to adopt that sort of asshole mentality but i quickly realized that the judicious use of that approach in no way made me an asshole and in fact it actually could be greatly appreciated by women who often found the directness confidence and blatant disregard for convention behind such audacity refreshing and stimulating i quickly became the kind of asshole that nice guys like my former self hated
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont agree but its well constructed there are definitely problematic elements whether or not theres an inclination to argue the point as of yet uncertain what are the problematic elements
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well obviously only you know you but just for a womens regular dirty vagina is a pretty angry statement just an assumption by me that really isnt important as for the gay thing my theory would hold true for them as well as its the desire for orgasm that is the true innate condition procreation is a consequence of that desire
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,something having primacy doesnt preclude other things
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats a no then
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,cute attractive especially for men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is a very narrow view to take to think that the entertainment industry itself has no effect on the performers within it is quite naive men direct hollywood films hollywood films sideline women into roles where only their looks have value actresses then internalize this mindset its a similar process for female musicians you havent noticed this before
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they equate their sexual worth with their worth as a human being not to mention do the same to men hence using virgin as an insult
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well now you are just stereotyping all women and thats not allowed heh
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the male in this case did not feel slighted by mention of a positive characteristic that did not relate to his musical performance while the female did
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,bringing up physical appearance when it bears no relevance on the subject matter means that you consider those physical aspects to be the persons defining feature or at least that it is more important than anything else
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre not responding to anything thats actually been said in this thread no one is saying people should be banned from commenting no one is calling it hate speech were just saying its rude youre arguing with a strawman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i get that what i dont get is why some online comments bother some people so much in the first place i think getting annoyed or bothered by a perceived negative comment is just normal human reaction do you think there should be legal consequences for hurting someones feelings no as i said people are free to make whatever comments they like i fully support that up until we reach a point of inciting violence or making threats
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes of course this is how change works it rarely happens all at once in unanimous agreement
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok women are also repulsed by the thought of average to unattractive men as sexual creatures average men unattractive men are just males to women sexual blanks males are not sexual they are supposed to be asexual having no sexual identification they are not supposed to act in a sexual way they are supposed to be like neutered pets neither male nor female just sexually neuter just its so when an averageunattractive man expresses sexual interest in a woman who isnt attracted to him she recoils in disgust as if to say what hes not attractive hes not supposed to act like that who the fuck does he think he is acting like a man who wants sex and from me no less now i know where youre coming from
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not to mention the ephebophiliapedophilia that many dudes on reddit argue is natural male sexuality the idea that grown men my fathers age want to fuck preteens makes me want to throw up
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what i am stating is that people find chris pratt attractive all of the articles are discussing chris pratt in a positive light no one is complaining that he is too jacked why do pics of him clothed not matter you stated that men in the early were these jacked guys that women fauned over sawyer and nsync disprove your point bill cosby was the only outlier and shows that men in top tv shows got hotter rather than stay with dad bods you not finding jennifer ansiton attactive at her is your opinion thats fine but there are still people who find her beautiful and she is still one of the highest paid actresses in hollywood i dont think socioeconomic geographical locations are the reason for why those men are so popular it largely comes down to age of the women fangirling grown women arent not buying tshirts with sawyer or daryl its teen girls and teen girls arent latching on to uber masculine liam neeson or the rock as the women grow older their preferences change to more idris elba types or george clooney types
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,that model works great for ethnic and economic groups but not so much for sex there isnt any other example where you are sleeping with and providing for members of the group you are trying to keep down what every society based upon the patriarchy operates this way nearly every single middle eastern society operates this way many societies in asia operate this way russian society operates this way seriously think a bit before you say things like this the unilateral oppression and hatred model that i used to believe in and that the majority of society buys is horribly inadequate to describe historical sex roles its not being used to describe anything its just an observation there are plenty of men out there who hate women this is not some opinion poll this is real life its so condescending to think that men of today are generally so much kinder to women than were men of the past and equally so that women of the past were either too weak or stupid to do anything about it they did do something about it they fought for womens suffrage fought they fought for every single law on the books that tries to protect women from men who discriminate against them or beat the shit out of them they fought for the right to divorce abusive husbands and they fought for the right to control their bodies and their reproductive capacities where the fuck were you when all this was happening and do you know why it didnt happen earlier because men were actively working to keep women in their societal role through social pressure intimidation and physical violence if necessary you are the one who is condescending here by not recognizing the fight women have gone though for every one of their rights today
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in general i find women like men who put forth an effort to show interest well of course but there are tons of ways to put forth an effort to show interest that dont involve shouting nice ass or grabbing someone i want to make it clear that im not shaming you for doing this it sounds like a funny moment and it worked and thats fine im merely commenting on the effectiveness of the strategy not the morality of it aka hot guys get away with shit that less hot guys would get lynched for this is true too but even hot guys have a limit although that limit will vary from woman to woman personally no matter how hot i find a guy there are certain triggers that will flip that switch off instantly being too handsy before i know them well is a big one so is smoking or being rude to a server other women might have different triggers than me but everyone has them hot guys arent completely immune thought they may get away with more minor transgressions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,gotcha that makes a lot of sense i think a lot of girls have this mindset too especially if theyre brought up in really repressive religious environments for me the implication growing up was that any guy who wants to have sex with you and is open about that fact is disrespecting you i remember the first time my first boyfriend slapped my ass i flipped out on him and couldnt believe he would touch me in such a disrespectful way but in the right context theres nothing disrespectful about such an action i eventually figured that out and apologized to him my upbringing caused me to view sex as dirty and disgraceful and to interpret any open expression of it especially from a man to a woman as disrespect i could see how these messages could be equally confusing and damaging for a young man just goes to show that when sexuality is repressed and shamed nobody wins thanks for offering your insight
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it must be a sad life to be that enslaved by someones genitals
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,sounds boringgeneric let me know how that turns out for you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right the reason women suck and have shit selfesteem is because theyve internalized all of the evil things men have said and done to them over the years and they actually believe it and unconsciously make it true even the strong independent women are still affected at least a little bit by all of the evil things men have said and done over the years and the fix for this is for men to bend over backward and begin a standard of behavior way more strict than women exhibit toward men to undo all of this damage or i dunno keep objectifying women as always because as much as they say theyre liberated women keep right on doing what men say you know the best way to get away with telling a girl nice boobs being hot women will be annoyed as hell when some uglyass loser give them a thorough recounting of all of the great things he enjoyed about her talented performance and pleased as punch when a hot guy says i liked your song wanna get out of here even though its clear that hot guy has nothing intelligent to say about the song at all and just considers her a sexual creature women want to be sex objects but only for the right men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre not responding to anything thats actually been said in this thread no one is saying people should be banned from commenting no one is calling it hate speech were just saying its rude youre arguing with a strawman yes and im saying the bar for what constitutes rudeness has been lowered when it comes to women in line with the hypersensitive culture promoted by feminism now it seems commenting on something other than the topic of a video posted by a woman is considered being rude even if it is nonsexual
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,tbf women say the same things they complain about not being the white blonde blue eyed girl everyone wants when they approach people they get a eww no thanks or get made fun by the guys friends there are two sides to the same coin
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,did you read what i wrote
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its teens not preteens
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,why nature does not care about arbitrary timelines people sexually mature at different ages if i see a hot woman i dont run up and ask how old she is to make sure my feelings are ok the assumption that the man is somehow bad for wanting a developed woman just because she hasnt lived long enough is incredibly shaming
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what i am stating is that people find chris pratt attractive all of the articles are discussing chris pratt in a positive light no one is complaining that he is too jacked why do pics of him clothed not matter because with the lone exception of two pics in the buzzfeed article not a single one of those links mentions anything about his muscles being attractive hes been a sex symbol since being doughy goofy andy on parks rec because of his personality not his muscles look at how many women flip over his tweets back and forth with his wife you stated that men in the early were these jacked guys that women fauned over sawyer and nsync disprove your point by your own definition nsync appealed to teen girls not women teen girls will always want a yonger thinner more teen looking body same reason why male pop stars typically sing in a falsetto that has nothing to do with what women want as for sawyer youre trying to tell me isnt jacked thats no otter body his head is disproportionately small you not finding jennifer ansiton attactive at her is your opinion thats fine but there are still people who find her beautiful and she is still one of the highest paid actresses in hollywood once again no one is arguing that shes gorgeous or highly paid with a fantastically connected publicist what im arguing and what trp is always arguing is that women arent sexy look dude im id love for a gal to be the epitome of sexy but im not fooling myself just check her imdb page she has three projects in postpro that are due to come out in she was named sexiest woman alive to kick off a publicity campaign which shes been ramping up with pregnancy rumors and street style shots the street style shots are especially telling shes gone on record numerous times saying she wears the same outfit out so paps dont make money off her all shots look like the same one unless shes intentionally trying to get media attention i dont think socioeconomic geographical locations are the reason for why those men are so popular eh thats a whole other debate and one we have in irc all the time it largely comes down to age of the women fangirling grown women arent not buying tshirts with sawyer or daryl its teen girls what teen girls like isnt what i was arguing i havent been a teen girl since the i dont know or care what they like but damn did i love jared leto as jordan catalano back in the day but the overall body type changes by decade its as true for men now as it always has been for women your example of the rock is a great one he got famous in the midst of the whole gorilla fad but hes no longer considered a sex symbol for women hes just a charismatic dude for something adult women theyve been fangirling out to joseph gordon levitt and the like even nick jonas has a huge adult woman fan base not that i personally understand that the stars who captivate the younger adult women are ottermode at the moment i have no doubt thats going to change most likely in the next year to two given whats going on in the fashion industry but for the moment its true
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what every society based upon the patriarchy operates this way nearly every single middle eastern society operates this way many societies in asia operate this way russian society operates this way seriously think a bit before you say things like this whoosh you really dont understand at all do you you are too far gone so i probably shouldnt be wasting my time trying to explain anymore you can reread what i wrote earlier if you are interested in changing but it appears not and do you know why it didnt happen earlier because men were actively working to keep women in their societal role through social pressure intimidation and physical violence if necessary well i guess that proves right there that women arent just as strong and capable as men as feminists keep trying to claim the suffrage movement that grew into modern feminism only happened once the world was safe and comfortable enough that men and women agreed it would not harm society too much to allow women to share some of the roles that men traditionally had thats the real reason why it never happened to the extent it has now throughout known history
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,especially if theyre brought up in really repressive religious environments or in feminism ime or in both as i was worst of all possible influences both the secular and nonsecular worlds were aligned in convincing me that male sexuality particularly was evil and bad and acting from it made me an sinful douchebag asshole the worst kind lol and im still not entirely free from that conditioning its not hard to make me feel guilt and shame regarding my sexuality as i experienced again directly not too many years ago when i was struggling with sex in my marriage despite all my efforts to recondition myself to the contrary the combo of the women are wonderful effect with male sexuality is awful is a potent onetwo punch to selfesteem
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,theres some insight in the original statement but not as direct as it proposes men are driven to compete and succeed because women choose winners and the only way a man is a winner is if he competes and succeeds men compete and drive society because theyve been selected for those very traits by women and are still selected for those traits today i agree its a weak argument to believe very much of civilization the washing machine an exception was created specifically to please women directly its all about the competition and its all about winning civilization is the result
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,only if youre unsuccessful
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the washing machine thats gold lol when it come to this issue theres a maybe an essay written by richard dawkins that comes to mind in defense of useless workthings some greatest achievements of humanity werent done for any other purpose than toiling studying thoughtfulness if youre that guy then youre nick dunn from gone girl where youre only at your best when some girl was carrotstick baiting you with her vaginacooche no thanks not for me egoistic boys with those characteristics are immature not for me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where does it end steroids alcohol abuse coke before the boardroom meeting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,anti depressants can depress the libido as well fuck that id rather a miserable suicidal wife who fucks than a happy one who doesnt ill take all your downvotes now doesnt matter cause i know im right
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,psychedelics everything else in the right hands you can use them to treat anxiety ptsd addiction depression anorexia cluster headaches racism materialsm and even a lack of motivation
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,every single thing can be used in a wrong way taking pills is no different besides id say its better for them to swallow actual pills than be depressed all day on rincels
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i was talking about people with social anxiety not married couples then again you could be right i personally didnt notice any change in my libido it was shit like always
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,if i had money i would try every single drug
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,a good hard marathon fuck sesh with lots of orgasms would solve your libido and your depression i once again volunteer for the job not because i want to but to end the incessant doom and gloom in your posts and consequently improve the morale at this sub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most drugs are shit and some are actually horrible experiences stick to the classics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never orgasmed during sex and honestly sex always made me feel very uncomfortable i sometimes envy people that like sex but i dont think it is for me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive never orgasmed during sex it all makes sense now honestly if that were me i might just give up on life as well
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,both images from googling average man or average woman for the man not ugly not attractive just plain looking wont be able to attract the average women on looks alone and will need to rely on other things for the woman plain looking compared to other women in this case shes a little chubby but an average woman doesnt have to be but shes still attractive she will be able to attract an attractive man despite what rp usually says this isnt because chad is pumping and dumping her inflating her standards its because an average woman is still genuinely attractive she still has a nice smile nice hair nice eyes and is generally pleasant to look at thats just the way attractiveness between genders works female features are attractive even average ones average male features are not the male needs to go above and beyond average to be attractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the average woman is prettier than the average man we are more concerned with how we look men will just leave the house looking like anything thats unattractive
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you need to define for their age or in general also its proven on okcupid that most women rate the average man as below average in looks chloe moret to me is above average in general but i have a hard time seeing she is anything more then a compared to most year old girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,is the average woman seen as more attractive yes shes a woman and men are likely to have sex with any passable looking woman yes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,women are more attractive than men because women work more on their appearance because theyre more judged for it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fat misshapen and somewhat ugly this is why we love it when we see attractive people even on a subconscious level
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there is no such thing as the average man or woman its just a shorthand statement similar to society society doesnt really exist its just a way of explaining something that would otherwise be impossible or take far too long
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,didnt httpsblogokcupidcomindexphpyourlooksandonlinedating determine that men accurately rate womens attraction but women saw anything out of the top as below average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,er the appearance by which i mean measurable aspects such as height eye and hair color and other precise physical attributes of the average woman is not a matter of opinion but pure fact for the usa we can calculate her age to a very precise figure her weight to a reasonable approximation etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,shes fat though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not huge on this because thats a pretty terrible picture of the average man the woman is in good lighting made up posing the man looks like he was caught midsentence im not necessarily saying your other points are wrong but the pictures are a bit skewed imho are you a man or a woman
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,they both look less than average to me they both could be better if they put more effort into their appearance but as pictured i would not describe them as average like at best
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the girl is very pretty just a little chub shes far above average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so the average woman is more likely to be madeup hair done etc while the average man will just throw on a tshirt and shorts without shaving what about in terms of pure physical attributes no makeup no styling gel nothing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the average women in america is also slightly more obese then the average man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the thing is its all subjective thats my goal here but you named a white year old so well go with that what to you does the average white year old look like one male one female pictures if possible
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,chloe moret is like a though almost a listers especially young ones are in the upper numbers
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so what would you say the average man looks like vs the average woman do you have maybe photo examples
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ok cupid is not indicative of the real word though the population sample is below average small and skewed towards introverts
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol appearance is subjective some people like curvy kim k types some like skeleton thin women that is why weight cannot determine attractiveness alone
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,okay so what does the average man and woman look like and is the average man unfuckable
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,true but i think theyre average for their age group
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it looks like they have similar body types to me neither are fit both have a slight chub
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there are probably some things that the man can do to make himself look better he isnt holding himself or expressing himself great and his hair is undone but still i think its obvious that hes average hes a little chubby very pale doesnt have any striking features he would probably be able to be fairly attractive if he lost some weight and built some muscle im male btw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im not huge on this because thats a pretty terrible picture of the average man the woman is in good lighting made up posing the man looks like he was caught midsentence on the other hand we are spared the mans probably fat body but get to see the womans
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,eh i dont really agree with uabcyz i think that without all the extra effort put in by women the average woman and the average man are pretty much the same sure women have some advantages like a more aesthetic figure and better fat distribution but women are more likely than men to have adult acne due to hormones and dark undereye circlesblotchy skin due to having thinner skin so i think it pretty much evens out
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yes without the physical attributes we still look prettier i was looking in the average manwoman thread and for the pic of the average guy i was like ew but the average woman looked pretty womens faces are just prettier if you look in nature generally males are prettier than the females like those colorful tropical birds humans were made to be the opposite i guess
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah so fat is cute
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,grats special snowflake if all men were like you this thread would not exist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not literally all subjective if i said the average guy is two feet tall and has bright blond hair that is not a valid opinion it is a demonstrably false claim
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,as a child actress she was adorable as an adult she is fairly plain lookign year old girl she is not unattractive but if i saw her with a group of friends irl and never knew she was an actress i dont think she would be striking at all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,which age group which country which race
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i believe it was the largest single source study ever done but even if it wasnt exactly the largest it was more than large enough to be statistically significant
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you are entirely wrong it is not entirely subjective to say a person is five feet tall has auburn hair and their eyes are inches apart there is zero room for debate on these measurements your confusion comes from saying whether these objective measurements are directly related to subjective attractiveness which is an individual judgement you can disagree with a claim about whether a persons feet are pretty you cant disagree with a factual measurement of their shoe size the shoe size is the shoe size and is not for debate unless you can prove the measurement was wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,give me the money it takes to obtain an accurate answer and ill tell you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol her arm is almost as thick as his in a dress
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i mean i think the expression and hold alone does him no favors get a half decent photographer on both of those people and i think theyd be seen as equals she too is chubby and her features could be accentuated through makeup and lighting
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,also true i think there are more equal pictures of two average people that can be found
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ideally i agree with you there is that even out i think that oftentimes the aesthetics of the bone structure can give women the edge but average is subjective after all
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,remove the makeup and you got yourself one ugly human on average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,correct but within a spectrum there is variance im not asking for height and weight and average bone density im asking for your opinion on what a attractive person looks like
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,really so then what does an average guy look like to you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,whatever your countryrace is and your age group depending on if youre a teenager early late or older the average person you generally see whether that be white black brown asian whatever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not how that works if i conduct a study to figure out the average iq and my sample size is every student in ivy league colleges thats a huge sample size but it is not a representative sample size of the general population so i cant say based on my study the average iq is x i can say the average ivy league students iq is x but not extrapolate that to the entire population so i can say okcupid men were rated below average i cant say all men are rated below average only a small certain type person uses okc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i agree so your statement a womans attractiveness is absolute fact is a lie because attractiveness is subjective her weight is a fact her attractiveness is an opinion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol if you dont want to answer just say it i asked for an opinion at first if you want to pretend you cant give one fine
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you cant see her hand and why does it matter if shes wearing a dress im confused are we seeing the same picture
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she isnt that fat id say she is high average but you cant really tell that from their arms especially since hers is smaller and his is pressed against her
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,remove the money and you have a useless man
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so youre asking me to pull a guess out of my ass not interested
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,late us white height weights based on data i found httphallsmdbodymassindexavhtm httpfxautobotcomimagespeterjpg
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,well the women were still rated on a symmetric curve a woman was as likely to be considered extremely ugly as extremely beautiful and the majority of women were rated about medium so it seems a full range of women are present on the site are you implying that generally only lowertier men use okcupid and thats a possibility for why the male ratings came out the way they did
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,are you offended that i wont undertake a hugely expensive piece of research just for shits and giggles for nothing because a person on the internet was curious
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this isnt a quiz show there are no prizes here im asking people for opinions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the supposedly average guy has a thick head of hair and a very strong jaw even if only of guys are bald it should skew the average so that the truly average guy would have slightly thinner hair same with the jaw for every strong jaw man there is a chinless guy like michael keaton the true average jaw would obviously be weaker there is a strict upper limit to how square a jaw can be and how much hair can be on a head hairs per square inch and the lower limit is zero
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats the average woman for you i wish around here theyre most a good lbs of extra fat unless they are early
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,so they seem generally of the same attraction at least to me would you say that the man would be deemed unfuckable by women
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im suggesting that you cant extrapolate data taken from a small specific population that likely shares a lot of characteristics not extremely attractive not very outgoing not confident in social situations into an entire population
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,im laughing at you thinking that posting a picture of what you see the average attractive person is which is very much subjective is hugely expensive research
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good for your broke ass not stopping single moms from being supported though
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i based this off of my age which is most year old men are not bald if i was doing average age theyd both be years older
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,both are percentile weight at average height
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,move to a city
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,there was a wide range of ages educational backgrounds ethnicities attractiveness etc im really not sure why you are striving to dismiss this as much as you are especially when it is supported by empirical experience evolutionary biology economic theory of supply and demand etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you have to include the bald minority in the outcome at least of men in their twenties have some hair loss the true average for men in their twenties will have hair but not as thick a covering as the man in your photo
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,neither show much interest in staying fit apparently too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because it is not an accurate sample size of the entire population do you need me to explain why again it is skewed towards a specific type of guy not the average guy there are not going to be many extremely hotconfidentsocially extroverted so the results will be skewed lower than average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you keep saying that but it was a statistically relevant sample your explanation makes leaping assumptions without justification or evidence particularly as there are plenty of hotconfidentsocially extroverted people involved in online dating
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is not a leaping assumption this is basic statistics you need a random sample of the population not take your sample from all people using a specific dating site there are not going to be any channing tatums using the dating site because they dont need to this is a dumb argument look up random sampling or what do you need for an accurate sample because size is not the only thing you need a sample representative of the entire population not a specific subset like men who use okc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it is a huge leaping assumption you repeating otherwise doesnt change that and whilst it may have been more heavily weighted to younger users it included plenty of older users too it was far more representative than any other research that has been done on the topic by virtue of the size of the group involved youre just making yourself sound silly claiming that the sample isnt statistically relevant when it not only is but it is the most statistically relevant sample ever assessed particularly when there are indeed plenty of cahning tatum types using it this is accounted for and explained in the article
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how is it relevant if its only a sample of single people not even that its an online dating site but it was only looking at single people that means it is representative of anyone in a relationship which is a huge portion of the population so how can it be representative when it doesnt include a huge section of the population
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what makes you think it is only single people lots of people might be casually involved or even seriously involved and looking in open relationships polyamorous seeking affairs etc but even if it was only single people the sample size was still enough to make it representative as not all people in relationships are in relationships at all times your argument has no validity it was a representative and statistically significant sample
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no youre assuming size is enough to make a sample valid its not if i took all white people and did a poll that would be a huge sample size but is it indicative of the entire population no because our population is black and i had black in my poll so our population is people who are datingmarried did that poll include of people who are dating or married no then how the fuck is it a representative poll its extremely not lol why cant you admit that
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,size is enough to make a sample valid where there is a sufficiently diverse sample which is the case here unless you are making the mistake of assuming that users either havent previously been married or otherwise in relationships or wont get married or otherwise go on to have relationships which is the mistake you appear to be making
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it cant just have some diversity it has to be representative of the sample so if you want it to be representative of the us it needs to have the same demographics of the us what are the chances that the okc study is the exact demographics of the us not very likely thats why its not a good study to extrapolate to the entire us or the world population you can only say on okc of men were found to be below average
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it cant just have some diversity it has to be representative of the sample which it is if you want it to be representative of the us it needs to have the same demographics of the us the whole point is that it doesnt have to have the same demographics just representative demographics
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,representative demographics are the same demographics by percentage if the population you want to represent is x your sample needs to be x otherwise it isnt representative
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it doesnt have to precisely mirror the total population in order to be representative or to have statistical significance
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,op some human beings are shitty some of those shitty human beings are women youre probably going to be happier in general if you just accept this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,trust me theres someone out there for her stop caring so much and making so many assumptions about the personal life of your coworker based on a few comments and instagram posts it just makes you seem immature and bitter i wonder if there is some envy or unrequited attraction involved here people like this exist no one is denying that i just dont understand how shes doing anything hypocritical she cant find what shes looking for and she presumably sleeps around trying to find it so what its a tale as old as time its more sad than anything
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she wants good hot guys to commit besides that before seeing the other side i never understood why doing one thing having fun means i couldnt love and be loved how it made me less human less me less interesting i still dont see it but i understand the preference shes giving it more easily to these guys because they have what it takes to get quick pussy unlike uglier guys and theyre doing all this because they can
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,where have all the good guys gone when hot women say this they are not talking about ugly guys they dont see you they are talking about the hot good guys why that is surprising to you is strange deny the guy who takes her for dinner for sex if you expect sex from a dollar dinner then you are not a good guy and she knows this that she would rather fuck another bad guy comes down to looks why would i ever think that you are a good girl when you slut it up on your instagram for the world to see are you saying good people cant be sluts or like attention about their body when a hot girl says a good guy i think she is talking about a guy who is polite nice slightly chivalrous understnding when a guy such as yourself says a good girl he is talking about a virgin or a chaste women you equate goodness with how many penises have been in her vagina thats equally bad if not worse also your idea of good and her idea of good are not incompatible because you both dont bring goodness to the table or accept the others definition of goodness why would i think you are a potential good mother when you clearly go on drunken rages and youre what does drinking on vacation have to do with being a good mother you have all of these demands all of these requirements yet what do you bring to the table besides a pretty face and a used up pussy oh shit manger phase this probably wont get through but if what counts in your mind about women is mostly based on their appearance and how tight their pussy is then you probably arent what these women see as a good guy and that probably combined with not being hot is why they dont want you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no one is making you date those girls keep whatever standards you have and find a girl who matches them why rage against something that ultimately doesnt effect you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you sound butthurt why do you care about random women posting stuff on social media that nothing to do with you anyway if you want to date good girls go where they are and stop wasting time hate following people on instagram it is stupid and a waste of time
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,post comes across very bitter she can live her life how she wants to however youre right that people often act in a way that is counter to what they claim to want exhibiting behaviours that often drive away the people they are looking for when people of either gender moan to me that they cant find find a goodclassy or whatever guy or girl or that theres none left i always come back with that being likely an issue with them not other people where are they hanging out who are they hanging out with dudebros tend to be people so called ordinary good guys avoid what do they bring to the table in a relationship etc
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yet what do you bring to the table besides a pretty face and a used up pussy the rest of my personhood obviously why are you even looking at hot girls what do you bring to the table other than a basic job same as them if youre coworkers an inexperienced dick and a lack of openmindedness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,aww sounds like someone needs a nap
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,deny the guy who takes her for dinner for sex maybe part of the problem is that you think you are owed sex for taking someone out to dinner otherwise this entire post just sounds like jealousy that these girls are going out having fun and living their lives the way they want without you you might not see them as a potential good mate but others could they want a good man and an ltr and maybe they are looking in the wrong places but that doesnt mean that all the guys at clubs are resident steroid gym no lifers why is going to the gym seen as bad by you how do you know they dont have good jobs they arent all bad guys either you make a lot of assumptions
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,uh dont date those women if you dont want to are hot instagram girls coming up to you to ask for long term relationships with them people get what they can get if they have trouble finding what they want its on them but i dont see why youre so personally mad
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this is the same kind of woman that will post all of these requirements for dating deny the guy who takes her for dinner for sex i am a little confused here you said your coworker was hot correct hot women will demand hot men if they want an ltr they want a hot man and commitment this seems equal to me what is the hypocritical part
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,then the weekend later flies out to vegas and posted pics of her at wet republic hugging one of the resident steroid gym no lifers ive taken pictures standing next to hot men while on vacation or at the club there exists one of me and some guy where hes kissing my cheek we look quite cozy id just met him prior at no point did i fuck him or any of them women take pictures of themselves with men like that for the same reason men take pictures of themselves with hooters chicks or car show models hot people flock to venues like wet republic rehab and tao beach to socialize and mingle with other hot people get over it and what on earth makes you think just because theyre fit theyre no lifers you sound like the nerd calling every dude on the football team asshole jocks because youre jealous this is the same kind of woman that will post all of these requirements for dating deny the guy who takes her for dinner for sex hot women can demand this because they will get it let me say it again hot women will demand this because they will get it get over it what are hot desirable women supposed to do settle for ugly omega slobs because theyre nice how they cant find a viable man because they cant find a viable man not by their standards so why work for the milk when you will give it for free well you arent working for anything though you and your ilk are not even on the radar of those women vegas loving vip poolside cabana partying hot girls are not checking for you why would i ever think that you are a good girl when you slut it up on your instagram for the world to see plenty of women exclude men theyre actually interested in from that part of their lives the reason you and the others see that side of her is because shes not interested and doesnt care if you form a negative opinion of her because of what you might witness
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,perhaps i worded this wrong alot of the people commenting are missing the point of my post i dont care about the partying it is the hypocrisy and the entitlement that gets to me i believe that is perfectly warranted and this is way bigger than co worker
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i think you are right in a sense that women have been coddled so much by the society to the point that they can do no wrong women expect so much and yet they give nothing in return when guys hold their standards they are sexist because they cannot accept womens flaws so what if guys prefer virgins its not sexist its called preference
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,again here we have some internet crap being used to represent all or most women when i reality its a minority
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i see all kinds of variation in the personalities of the women i meet i still dont understand it when people meet either men or women and think that they are all basically the same
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,true but will get backlash from ppd
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i dont believe theyre shitty its not like theyre thinking long and hard about what theyre doing no pun intended if anything these sorts of women lack strong male guidance and become victims of our societys toxic mindset
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good girls require self control and discipline and not cheaply giving access to their pussy a girl that gives a man her pussy for cheap often andor regularlyor has done so much in the past isnt trustworthy and doesnt know her own value sluttiness is a signal of characteror lack thereof you mentioned mens beauty like that should be some important selector it isnt women do not require beautiful men by any means rather they want healthy masculine men
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,this whole response is amazing
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it does affect us greatly too this is normal behavior in our culture and it incentives normal beautiful women into becoming hoes in the end the hoe suffers the most perhaps shell be able to get a guy she wants in the end but in the meantime you hear her suffering
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because he wants to and so far congress hasnt required him to obtain your permission to speak his mind
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not the point of the post please reread come on reddit you can do better than this
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,any built good looking guy is a douchebag did you miss that day in school i slept alot in class so no judgement lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what is the hypocrisy that they want to ltr these attractive men but end up having flings and casual sex instead they would ltr those men if they were willing how is their entitlement any different than anyone who wants something they are not getting dont you wish attractive girls wouldnt sleep with good looking bad boys and settle for someone like you instead is that entitlement any different
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,right but you cannot do anything about the hypocrisy of other people people are hypocritical spend time with the ones who are not and work on letting this go you are mad because the world is not fair this is not going to change ever
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not only that its also based entirely on ops perception of this womans life based on her instagram so silly
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,she sounds pretty hot and fun to be around
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yep backlash as predicted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how are they victims they are making their own choices and thats nobodys business but their own certainly not societys if a guy doesnt find women like that to be dateable then by all means he shouldnt date them and the problem with your worldview is that the onus of self control is placed entirely on women its just assumed that men cant say no which i think is unfair to men and more than a little misandric perhaps they should also take some responsibility if theyre so concerned with female promiscuity
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,its not like theyre thinking long and hard about what theyre doing lol i totally did when i was having lots of casual sex it was pretty calculated it wasnt like i just lost control and started fucking everyone lmao the problem here is you think everyone gives a fuck about men who think women who sleep around are not marriage quality most women who sleep around perceive guys like that to be weak as all hell and are not interested in them i have never ever met an attractive man with this kind of mindset
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,good girls require self control and discipline and not cheaply giving access to their pussy how you are assuming she is giving up sex out of desperation in fact she could be strategic about it and just really enjoy casual sex and everyone likes sex a girl that gives a man her pussy for cheap often andor regularlyor has done so much in the past isnt trustworthy and doesnt know her own value this is a weird conflation you are conflating how many dicks a girl has been on with trustworthiness please explain how these correlate but again this is why rps and the girls they lament after are not compatible they want a virginal girl this to them means being good the girls they get pissed at for not wanting them want an understanding guy women do not require beautiful men by any means rather they want healthy masculine men media and everything around you tells you the opposite but yes keep pretending being stronk and only knowing how to lift a fucking heavy object above your head means you are a dreamboat
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh i dont know being cuckolded with a child from another man nigga how go one a vacation with your girl and have wild drunken sex also not everyone who drinks is going to fuck some random dude wont even bother with the rest of your post not worth my time lol the fuck this is like a discussion board your post reeks of angry venting why post it here if youre not willing to engage in discussion
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,oh i dont know being cuckolded with a child from another man its still her child and she will probably be a good mother to her own child also contraception exists btw
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,in the end the hoe suffers the most just world fallacy beautiful sloots end up quite happy this is normal behavior in our culture and it incentives normal beautiful women into becoming hoes its just the female version of spinning plateswifing up good girls
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you hear suffering from hot women getting all the casual sex they want uh huh sounds like such a terrible life if they didnt want to be hoes they wouldnt be
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,it does affect us greatly too in what way does this affect you
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,nope but congress hasnt made it illegal for me to laugh at his impotent rage either
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,youre right its clear youre salty and wanted ppd to be salty about your smoking hot coworker going out having fun and living her life too
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,any built good looking guy is a douchebag nah man youre wrong
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i mostly kept to myself and read books and ignored boys so i think i missed it too lol
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the hypocrisy is that most men do not like whores who sleep around and yet they go to las vegas to get fucked and they actually post about it on ig pretty simple and no i doubt they would ltr the roiders in vegas how is their entitlement any different than anyone who wants something they are not getting because its counterproductive to what they say they want because they complain when they have trouble pair bonding with a regular guy after they got fucked by brad the beefcake dont you wish attractive girls wouldnt sleep with good looking bad boys and settle for someone like you instead no i wish i wouldnt be asked stupid questions like this that tries to turn this around on me
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,fucking troll
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,because you havent explained how this involves hypocrisy and entitlement do i have to spell it out for you most men do not consider women who sleep around to be good marriagerelationship material i really have to explain this i wonder how you even know she fucks men dude its las vegas have you ever been there are you living under a rock or something lol people go there to get drunk and fuck its called sin city for a reason assuming thats true have you considered the possibility that she is doing so because she is so lonely and insecure about the fact that she cant find a man who wants her for more than sex she goes to vegas because she cant find a man who wants her for more than sex makes no sense lol i am genuinely curious though how do you know shes fucking them because its las vegas
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,lol posting in a debate sub and then calling it backlash as predicted
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,what backlash youre in a debate sub son
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,i just think its gross to fuck randoms every weekend
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,how you are assuming she is giving up sex out of desperation in fact she could be strategic about it and just really enjoy casual sex and everyone likes sex hot girls are not desperate for sex having sex for fun through ons and casual hook ups is cheapening her value she should only fuck guys shed want to have commit or else whats the point aside from fun if she is strategic she will extract resources andor commitment out of the man shes fucking anything less is a waste of potential and trading what she has thats more valued by men for relatively nothing she loses out this is a weird conflation you are conflating how many dicks a girl has been on with trustworthiness please explain how these correlate if she cant control her sexuality thorough self control and discipline how can i believe she has a well developed self control and discipline when things in an ltr get rocky when couples have their fights and angry moments when one goes out of town when a committed woman crosses paths with another attractive man how do you trust her without a solid track record past behavior is a great predictor of future behavior but again this is why rps and the girls they lament after are not compatible they want a virginal girl this to them means being good the girls they get pissed at for not wanting them want an understanding guy can you clarify here all women want masculine men virginal or slutty shy girl or party girl media and everything around you tells you the opposite but yes keep pretending being stronk and only knowing how to lift a fucking heavy object above your head means you are a dreamboat our media is full of bullshit it confuses both men and women distorts masculinity and femininity and so you see the resulting androgyny men need to be fit and masculine not pretty boys with perfect symmetry women fucking for fun outside of a committed relationship is incredibly masculine behavior for example theyre like female players except dick is cheap and easy to get and pussy is expensive more valued and rare and time limited yet they act like the double standard created by our very natures doesnt exist
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,go one a vacation with your girl and have wild drunken sex you asked what does drinking on vacation have to do with being a good mother most men dont like women who sleep around and do not consider them marriage material pretty simple nigga see usetconsumes as to why its not good and theres more to be said
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,facepalm
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no shit and the extremely beautiful can often wind up like some rich kids entitled and ungrounded
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,you hear suffering from hot women getting all the casual sex they want uh huh sounds like such a terrible life it is especially once baby rabies kick in and no man has stayed committed if they didnt want to be hoes they wouldnt be hahahaha its instinct to use sexuality to their advantage but it doesnt mean its always used beneficially in the long run the problem with hoes is that they dont look at the long run much at all and focus mostly on the short term typically instant gratification pleasure
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,no im not the better looking a guy is the bigger of an asshole he is in the us anyway im related to a chad i see this shit basically every weekend
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the hypocrisy is that most men do not like whores who sleep around who cares about what men want these women are looking out for what they want i am asking in all honesty
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,do they want to ltr regular guy only do they say they hate having sex with brad the beefcake and wish only regular guys would go for them well its not hypocrisy that what they want is in conflict with what men want theyre clearly living lives as they see fit not to appease guys like you or win your approval but how noble of you to be worried theyre not getting what they want im sure they will find something i still dont understand why youre raging at these women how are you involved if you dont want to date women who have had casual sex dont i really dont understand this logic of being upset at other peoples sex lives its either sour grapes or some dumb logic like a christian conservative who is mad gays are having butt sex
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the hypocrisy is that most men do not like whores who sleep around well i wont deny that men dont like it but its not hypcritcal of a woman to sleep around just cause a man doesnt like it
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,the hypocrisy is that most men do not like whores who sleep around how is that hypocritical it would only be hypocritical if she demonstrated she wanted to live the hot girl party lifestyle while simultaneously demanding to be wifed exclusively by good christian men™
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,most men do not consider women who sleep around to be good marriagerelationship material i really have to explain this most women dont consider drug addicts to be good marriagerelationship material this does not make drug addicts who want partners hypocritical
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,ive been to vegas twice both times while i was single at and went out to clubs and partied took lots of pics dressed like a slut drank and even took some drugs didnt have sex didnt even want to neither did my friends women arent men we dont go to vegas to get laid you still havent explained how you know
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,not sure how thats funny but ok
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,yeah how could i forget its not like theres any agreements or threads with upvotes
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,thats not what i did
PurplePillDebate,not_removed,hot girls are not desperate for sex having sex for fun through ons and casual hook ups is cheapening her value how thirsty guys will still go after her trust if she is strategic she will extract resources andor commitment out of the man shes fucking god you guys are still pedestaling the hot women even though claim not to be havent you ever wanted to fuck someone but not anything else besides this she should only fuck guys shed want to have commit or else whats the point aside from fun thats exactly the point its fun its low stakes if she cant control her sexuality thorough self control and discipline how can i believe she has a well developed self control and discipline you are assuming that she is having sex out of desperation she is having sex because its fun if she is smart and knows what she wants and takes the hottest guy or exactly what she wants home from the bar then she is strategic and has showed self control because shes not just fucking every dude who offers when things in an ltr get rocky when couples have their fights and angry moments when one goes out of town when a committed woman crosses paths with another attractive man how do you trust her without a solid track record again you are assuming she is fucking everyone who offers the reality is an above average woman has many offers and if she selects the best for casual sex then why would you assume she has no self discipline can you clarify here when you say good girl you mean a virgin when she says good guy she means understanding flexible hes not going to get caught up and moan cuck in the shower through tears over her past our media is full of bullshit yes but not for the reasons you think it is really not that many girls care about how much you lift and how stronk you are a lot of trps do this and then eventually flee to or because it does nothing if you are still an uncoordinated nerd then being stronk and obsessive about lifting wont change that the guys i know who got the most puss in college did high reps with really low weights and the nerd stronk brigade laughed at them but guess who was in the gym every night and guess who was fugging bishes men need to be fit and masculine not pretty boys with perfect symmetry hey man but thats just like your opinion women fucking for fun outside of a committed relationship is incredibly masculine behavior for example and yet they still get committment isnt that why you guys are always bitching pussy is expensive more valued and rare still pedestaling the puss i see i mean overall sex feels good are you implying that sex doesnt feel good for women so that a women who enjoys sex is abnormal
